Abstract    :
                   An important part of auroral research is to understand the                
              generation of the auroral current systems and the acceleration of              
              auroral electrons (responsible for the auroral emissions which                 
              can be seen on the ground).  This grant addresses three separate               
              but related topics which are concerned with the coupling,                      
              energetics, and dynamics of the magnetosphere-ionosphere system                
              and the auroral acceleration process due to Alfven waves.  The                 
              first topic is an investigation of the ionospheric cavity and its              
              relationship to auroral arc breakup.  The second topic is the                  
              coupling of the shear flow generator at the low latitude boundary              
              layer to the auroral ionosphere.  The third topic is an                        
              investigation of a new mechanism for auroral electron                          
              acceleration due to Alfven wave breaking.  These investigations                
              will be carried out primarily through fluid simulations using                  
              fluid models though a hybrid kinetic simulation will be used for               
              the third topic.
