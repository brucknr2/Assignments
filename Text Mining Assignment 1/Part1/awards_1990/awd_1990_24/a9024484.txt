Abstract    :
              A number of so-called massively parallel computers exist today.  While         
              some of these support an easier-to-program shared memory programming           
              model, the greatest potential for highly efficient use of non-shared           
              memory parallel computers will require use of some form of non-shared          
              memory programming model.  Distributed or decentralized control                
              applications also require use of a non-shared memory programming               
              model.                                                                         
                                                                                             
              This research continues previously supported work towards developing           
              and refining Petri-Net based models of distributed computation, and            
              carries the models into automated and semi-automated software tools to         
              aid programmers.  The tool environment, called eXplicitly Parallel             
              Algorithm analysis Tool (XPAT), supports graphical/visual programming          
              as much as possible and also supports visualization of programs once           
              written.
