Abstract    :
                   This Faculty Award for Women Scientists and Engineers is                  
              made to Dr. Janine Shertzer of the Physics Department, the                     
              College of the Holy Cross.  Dr. Shertzer will continue to use                  
              the finite element method to investigate the helium atom,                      
              positron scattering, the hydrogen atom in strong magnetic                      
              fields, quantum heterostructures in the solid state, and the                   
              binding energy of the deutrium-tritium-muon molecule.                          
                   The NSF Faculty Award for Women recognizes the high                       
              quality of the awardee's record in teaching and scholarship as                 
              well as potential for continued significant contributions to                   
              scientific research, the academic profession, and the                          
              education of future scientists.  Particularly noteworthy                       
              achievements are Dr. Shertzer teaching of upper-division                       
              courses, designing courses for non-science majors, and her                     
              research in theoretical physics.
