Abstract    :
              Five senior researchers will survey the fauna of selected                      
              arthropods in two of the most unique and critically threatened                 
              habitats in the midsouth Coastal Plain - the Black Belt Prairie and            
              the Loess Hills in Mississippi.  The survey will involve intensive             
              collections of arthropods from these habitats during June, 1991-               
              May, 1992.  Remaining remnants of the Black Belt Prairie are being             
              lost by erosion, plant succession, and conversion to pastureland,              
              and some sites have been proposed for placement of a hazardous                 
              waste disposal facility.  The Loess Hills are imminently threatened            
              by harvest of hardwood timber.  Mites, spiders, moths, bees, and               
              selected beetles and flies will be collected with various traps and            
              specialized methods.  Specimens will be processed and studied by               
              senior researchers and collaborators at institutions throughout the            
              United States.  Specimen data, including taxonomic names,                      
              localities, and recorded results will be entered into a                        
              computerized database.  Survey results will be used for documenting            
              the biodiversity of the threatened habitats, describing the                    
              morphology, taxonomy, and distribution of these arthropods, and                
              investigating biogeographic and evolutionary relationships of the              
              fauna in southeastern United States.
