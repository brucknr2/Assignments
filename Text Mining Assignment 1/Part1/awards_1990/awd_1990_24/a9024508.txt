Abstract    :
              The surface science techniques of Auger electron spectroscopy,                 
              low energy electron diffraction, ultraviolet photoelectron                     
              spectroscopy, alkali ion scattering spectroscopy and forward                   
              focusing angle-resolved X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy will                  
              be used to examine ultrathin films and monolayers.  The systems                
              to be studied include palladium films.   Studies will be                       
              carried out of the effect of various gases, including carbon                   
              monoxide, nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, ethylene and                         
              acetylene, on the film properties using primarily high                         
              resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy and temperature                   
              programmed desorption.   Kinetic studies will be performed and                 
              some catalytic reactions will be examined.   The analytical                    
              probes used have the ability to probe subtle changes in the                    
              geometric and electronic structure of the materials studied,                   
              and should enable a better understanding of chemisorption and                  
              reactivity to be obtained.                                                     
                                                                                             
              %%%                                                                            
              The research, in the general area of Analytical and Surface                    
              Chemistry, focuses on surface science studies of monolayers and                
              ultrathin films of palladium on early transition metal single                  
              crystal substrates.  The study aims to correlate these studies                 
              with the chemisorption and reaction properties of the films.                   
              The work promises to lead to a greater understanding of the                    
              properties of thin metal films which will have a wide range of                 
              important applications in materials science and catalysis.
