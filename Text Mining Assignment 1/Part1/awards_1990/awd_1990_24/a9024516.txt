Abstract    :
              This investigation is concerned with a number of important problems in         
              computational algebra.  These include algorithms for evaluating roots          
              of polynomials, evaluating eigenvalues of matrices, polynomial                 
              interpolation, etc.  Several questions related to lower bounds on the          
              depth of computation trees will also be explored.
