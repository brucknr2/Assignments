Abstract    :
              The proposed work is the lead project in an integrated research                
              program into the oceanographic structure of the western Weddell                
              Sea.  It is to be carried out from an ice camp jointly occupied                
              by U.S. and USSR scientists from February to June 1992.  This                  
              project concerns the large-scale oceanographic circulation and                 
              the variability of the Weddell Sea boundary current, and how                   
              these affect and are affected by the regional water mass                       
              formation and modification processes.  The Weddell Sea may be                  
              divided into three regions on the basis of the energy exchange                 
              mode.  The warm regime occurs in the east where the intrusion of               
              warm circumpolar deep water keeps the water temperature nea +1                 
              deg C.  The cold regime occurs in the center, where deep water is              
              overlain by a thick near freezing mixed layer.  In both regions                
              however enough heat is seasonally carried to the sea ice to melt               
              it completely.  In the western region, the sea ice cover does not              
              melt, and it is expected that the thermodynamics processes will                
              be different.  Hydrographic data, coupled with the current meter               
              observations, chemical tracer experiments, turbulent flux                      
              measurements, and sea ice dynamics that are part of this project,              
              will provide a unique picture of the Weddell Sea continental                   
              slope processes.
