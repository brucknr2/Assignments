Abstract    :
              This research is to develop a new class of spatial light                       
              modulators, which are comprised of ferroelectric liquid crystal                
              (FLC) modulators and silicon VLSI substrates to provide                        
              optoelectronic interconnects between processors and memory.  By                
              coating a silicon substrate with FLC material, those neural                    
              optoelectronic devices will have the advantages of both                        
              technologies: optics provides parallel inputs and outputs (avoiding            
              the VLSI pin-out limitations); and, electronics provides the                   
              flexibility of the processing function.  These devices are ideally             
              suited for optoelectronic computing applications such as optical               
              pattern recognition and correlation, analog memory for vector                  
              quantizers, optical neural networks and early sensory perception               
              chips.
