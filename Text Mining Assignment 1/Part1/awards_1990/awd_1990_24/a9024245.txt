Abstract    :
              Description:  This proposal supports the collaboration of                      
              Dr. Dwight Baker, Yale University, and Dr. Samira Mansour,                     
              Suez Canal University.  The overall purpose of this                            
              collaboration is to identify useful Frankia strain inocula                     
              that will improve growth and yield of Casuarina plantations                    
              in Egypt.  Much of the research will be conducted at the                       
              Suez Canal University in Ismailia, Egypt under the                             
              supervision of Dr. Samira Mansour.  Dr. Baker will assist in                   
              the design of the experiments in Egypt and travel to                           
              Ismailia for the set-up of screening trials.  At the                           
              conclusion of the trials in Egypt, Dr. Mansour will travel                     
              to Yale University and complete the DNA analyses in Dr.                        
              Baker's laboratory.                                                            
                                                                                             
              Scope:  This project brings together research scientists                       
              from two countries working on nitrogen-fixing trees                            
              (Casuarina) and bacterial symbionts (Frankia).  It is                          
              anticipated that this collaborative research effort will                       
              result in improved strains of Frankia that could enhance                       
              growth and yield of Casuarina.  This collaboration forms a                     
              valuable part of our emerging perceptions of Frankia                           
              biology.  Therefore, this project fulfills objectives of the                   
              Science in Developing Countries Program in its exchange and                    
              transfer of scientific knowledge through an international                      
              collaboration.
