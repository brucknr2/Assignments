Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The prevention of structural collapse during                                   
              an earthquake having a major intensity at a                                    
              site is a well recognized objective of                                         
              seismic design.  This project addresses the                                    
              importance in attaining this objective by                                      
              ensuring that buildings will not fail while                                    
              undergoing inelastic response.  This research                                  
              is part of an effort which seeks to provide a                                  
              practical and reliable methods to check the                                    
              safety of a building against inelastic                                         
              dynamic instability.                                                           
                                                                                             
              The specific objectives of the research are:                                   
              a) To investigate the means of identifying                                     
              the kinematic mechanism that will control a                                    
              building's dynamic response to sufficiently                                    
              strong ground motions. b) To calculate                                         
              instability limits for a number of                                             
              representative buildings and ground motions                                    
              using accurate mathematical models. c) To                                      
              examine the matter of inelastic dynamic                                        
              instability in the context of code-based                                       
              seismic design and develop recommended                                         
              guidelines for design.                                                         
                                                                                             
              The development of a method to check                                           
              instability which accounts for the inelastic                                   
              dynamic nature of the problem is currently                                     
              recognized as one of the priority needs for                                    
              improving seismic design performance                                           
              standards.  This research will lead to a                                       
              better understanding of how to prevent single                                  
              story and other undesirable collapse                                           
              mechanisms.
