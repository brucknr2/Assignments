Abstract    :
              This renewal award is made in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and                  
              Organometallic Chemistry Program to the University of North                    
              Carolina in support of the research of Dr. Maurice Brookhart.                  
              The focus of the research  is on olefin polymerization,                        
              oligomerization and dimerization using cationic, electrophilic                 
              late transition metal catalysts. These reactions are of major                  
              commercial importance.                                                         
                                                                                             
              Catalytic polymerization, oligomerization and dimerization                     
              reactions of olefins and functionalized olefins with cationic                  
              cobalt, rhodium, nickel and palladium complexes will be                        
              studied. Fundamental mechanisms of these reactions will be                     
              elucidated by spectroscopic studies of intermediates formed in                 
              the catalytic reactions. Emphasis will be on determining the                   
              resting state of the catalyst and the details of the key                       
              carbon-carbon bond forming steps. Characterization of the                      
              resulting polymers and oligomers, particularly structure,                      
              molecular weight distribution, extent of branching and                         
              placement of functional groups, will be carried out.
