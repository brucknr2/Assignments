Abstract    :
                   The aim of this research is to develop new results in the                 
              probabilistic analysis of algorithms.  In particular, this project             
              will concentrate on three areas:                                               
                                                                                             
              Random walks on graphs:  the aim is to improve the complexity of an            
              algorithm for computing volume and to develop randomized counting              
              schemes for some                                                               
                                                                                             
              Randomized heuristics:  the goal is to determine whether randomization         
              helps in some heuristics for combinatorial optimization.                       
                                                                                             
              Average performance of algorithms:  algorithms with good avverage case         
              performance will be developed for NP-hard problems and for problems            
              which are complete for P.
