Abstract    :
              This award supports the research of a cultural anthropologist                  
              studying small wood-working firms in Mexico.  The research will                
              examine a theory of "institutional economics" concerning the                   
              costs of transactions within and between firms.  The theory                    
              predicts that these transactions costs determine the shape and                 
              size of a firm, and this projects tests and advances this theory               
              by confronting it with data from small, often family-organized                 
              firms in a rural area of Mexico.  The theory was formulated to                 
              deal with all firms "in the abstract", but with often unconscious              
              bias towards the sorts of large firms one finds in developed,                  
              industrialized countries.   Confronting this theory with data                  
              from small family firms in a less developed country like Mexico                
              will reveal logical inconsistencies and flaws that can be                      
              modified to improve its power and generality.
