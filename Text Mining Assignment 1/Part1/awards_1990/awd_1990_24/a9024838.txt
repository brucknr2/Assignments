Abstract    :
              The goal of the research is the establishment of accurate and                  
              physically demonstrable dynamic interfacial crack initiation and               
              rapid crack growth criteria.  Experimental measurement of the                  
              near-tip deformation fields at bimaterial interfaces will be                   
              performed by means of a newly developed Coherent Gradient Sensor               
              technique (CGS) and ultra high speed photography.  Theoretical and             
              3-D numerical studies of dynamic fracture in bimaterial systems                
              will be conducted parallel to the experiments.  These will provide             
              direct comparison with the experiments and will ensure the accuracy            
              of the optical measurements.  The ability to perform direct                    
              near-tip dynamic measurements in real time will allow us to study              
              the effects of inertia and rate sensitivity on the initiation and              
              propagation toughness of bimaterial systems.
