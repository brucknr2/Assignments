Abstract    :
                   This project is concerned with modeling (derivation and                   
              presentation of equations of motion) and analysis (perturbation                
              methods, bifurcation techniques, numerical methods, etc.) devised              
              for and applied to problems in nonlinear, non-Fickian diffusion                
              which have recently arisen in a variety of scientific and                      
              technological fields.  Central problems emerging in these new                  
              technologies are types of diffusive motion quite unlike anything               
              predicted by classical diffusion theory.  They involve nonlinear               
              fixed and free boundary value problems, phase transitions, sharp               
              (shock-like) propagating fronts, and discontinuous steady states.              
                   Progress in materials science has spawned an extraordinary                
              wealth of new exciting scientific and technological problems.                  
              For example, polymers and composites are replacing traditional                 
              materials in many older scientific, engineering and commercial                 
              applications, and wholly new fields with a dazzling array of new               
              applications are emerging because of the existence of new                      
              synthetic polymers and composites.  This project deals with                    
              modeling and analysis to develop valid theories for the behavior               
              of new materials and accurate control of their properties.
