Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the research             
                                                                                             
              of Dr. Doubleday at Columbia University. The results of this                   
              research will provide new information about the reactions and                  
              properties of carbon-centered singlet biradical intermediates.                 
              These intermediates are produced in certain photolysis reactions               
              and have unbonded electrons on carbon atoms that are separated by              
                                                                                             
              carbon chains of varying lengths. Singlet biradicals have the                  
              unbonded electrons paired, the spin array found in bonds between               
              atoms. These intermediates have generated considerable interest                
              recently. Comparisons will be made between experimental results                
              and theory derived from molecular orbital calculations.                        
                                                                                             
              Singlet biradicals will be generated by picosecond flash laser                 
              photolysis techniques from a variety of precursors, including                  
              cyclic and bicyclic azo compounds, cyclic and bicyclic                         
              hydrocarbons, cyclic sulfides, and acyclic difunctional                        
              precursors. Properties and reactions of these biradicals will be               
              studied. The results of  molecular orbital calculations will be                
              used with canonical variational transition state theory to                     
              determine the reaction path in the decomposition of biradicals. A              
                                                                                             
              goal in these calculations is to explore the unusual role of                   
              entropy in the dynamics of singlet biradicals.
