Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research program addresses the need for a numerical                       
              model to compute tsunami propagation and runup.                                
              Specifically, it addresses the task of transferring to the                     
              United States a sophisticated computer code developed by                       
              Professor Shuto at Tohoku University in Japan.  This model                     
              can reproduce the maximum runup along the west coast of                        
              Japan which occurred as a result of the tsunami (seismic sea                   
              wave) generated by the 1983 Nihonkai-chubu earthquake.                         
              Significant experience has now been accumulated by                             
              Japanese researchers in applying the model to field cases.                     
                                                                                             
              This research project involves the non-trivial task of                         
              transferring this code to run on computers in the United                       
              States, where it will be available for use in tsunami research,                
              and as a predictive model for determining potential tsunami                    
              flooding along coastal areas.  Professor Shuto is assisting in                 
              this task.
