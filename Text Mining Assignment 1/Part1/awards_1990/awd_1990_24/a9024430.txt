Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This project comprises the analysis and assimilation of data              
              from the Doppler radars that will be deployed during the                       
              TOGA/COARE Intensive Observing Period (IOP).  The analysis will                
              emphasize the calculation of momentum and heat fluxes in the                   
              marine boundary layer.  The assimilation will emphasize the use                
              of data from all available Doppler radars in combination with                  
              newly developed Doppler radar assimilation techniques to                       
              construct the morphology and fluxes by convective complexes in                 
              the TOGA/COARE Intensive Flux Area (IFA).  The crux of the method              
              is the recovery for the full three-dimensional wind and                        
              temperature fields from a judicious blending of Doppler radar                  
              data and a dynamical model.                                                    
                                                                                             
                   This research is important because it serves as one of the                
              studies of TOGA COARE that links convective scale physical                     
              processes to the larger scales that impact climate variability in              
              an especially climate sensitive region of the world, the western               
              Pacific Ocean, the field site of TOGA COARE.
