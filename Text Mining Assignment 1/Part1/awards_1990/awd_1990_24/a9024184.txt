Abstract    :
                   This proposed research, a precursor to the SunRISE Program,               
              plans to reduce and analyze Mt. Wilson Observatory CaK                         
              spectroheliograms obtained on a daily basis between 1915-1988.                 
              These images provide by far the longest reliable record of solar               
              photospheric faculae and chromospheric plages.  The plan is to                 
              analyze the behavior of these structures in active regions and in              
              the network over the past seven solar cycles, for information on               
              the sun's magnetic fields and activity levels that is                          
              complimentary to data obtained from the sunspot index, and from                
              other much shorter data bases such as solar magnetograms.  The                 
              obtained results should assist upper atmospheric physicists and                
              climatologists in ongoing efforts to improve prediction and                    
              dynamical understanding of solar activity cycles.
