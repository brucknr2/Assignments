Abstract    :
              In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the                       
              Chemistry Division, the spectroscopy, photochemistry, and                      
              dynamics of coordinatively unsaturated transition metal                        
              carbonyls will be studied.  Such studies are important for both                
              the fundamental information they provide about the synthesis of                
              new inorganic compounds as well as the practical information                   
              about catalysis processes.

              Transient infrared spectroscopy will be the principal                          
              experimental method used to obtain information about the                       
              reaction kinetics and mechanisms, bond energies,                               
              photochemistry, and photophysics of the unsaturated metal                      
              carbonyls.  Real time information about a number of catalytic                  
              processes will be obtained and the important kinetic steps in                  
              their mechanisms will be elucidated.  Experiments will explore                 
              the role of "ligand slippage" in substitution reactions of                     
              saturated species, and a newly implemented kinetic technique                   
              will be used to measure bond dissociation energies in order to                 
              understand trends.
