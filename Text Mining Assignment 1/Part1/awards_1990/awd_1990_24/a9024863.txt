Abstract    :
                   This project is concerned with problems in ring theory and                
              deals with questions about the maximal subfields of finite                     
              dimensional division algebras.  The principal investigator will                
              consider the following two questions: (1) given a finite algebraic             
              extension L of a field K, does there exist a finite dimensional                
              division algebra with center K containing L as a maximal subfield?,            
              and (2) given a finite group G which occurs as a Galois group over             
              K, does there exist a Galois extension L of K with the Galois group            
              of L/K isomorphic to G and a factor set f mapping GXG into L* such             
              that the crossed product algebra (L/K,f) is a division ring?                   
                   The research supported in this project is in the general area             
              of ring theory.  The principal investigator will study how one                 
              central simple algebra can contain another.  This work draws on                
              some deep results in group theory and will shed light on various               
              questions in algebra and number theory.
