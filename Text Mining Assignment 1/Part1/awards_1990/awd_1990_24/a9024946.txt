Abstract    :
                   The design, simulation, and optimization of complex chemical              
              processes, whether steady-state or unsteady-state, can be made much            
              more effective by the exploitation of machines that use advanced-              
              computer architectures, such as those using vector and parallel                
              processing.  However, to take full advantage of such architectures,            
              the formulation of the process flowsheeting problem, and, more                 
              importantly, the solution algorithms used to solve these problems,             
              must be totally reworked.  This is an important challenge and                  
              opportunity in the area of chemical process design.  By using                  
              techniques developed for these architectures truly interactive                 
              design capabilities can be achieved that will greatly enhance the              
              productivity of the design engineer and thus produce designs that              
              are safer, more efficient and less costly.                                     
                   Strategies are developed for most effectively taking advantage            
              of advanced computer architectures for the steady-state and                    
              unsteady state design, simulation and optimization of complex                  
              chemical processes using the equation-based approach.  The                     
              techniques involve new, and sophisticated reordering methods for               
              the sparse matrix problem that underlies chemical process                      
              simulation, as well as many other new ideas for the solution of                
              these problems.  Such techniques are being implemented on a wide               
              variety of advanced-architecture machines.
