Abstract    :
              The purpose of this research is to develop a                                   
              computational technique to determine the critical                              
              flashover voltage of electrical power distribution                             
              lines and to verify the computational technique                                
              experimentally.  Given the field distribution for a                            
              specific transmission line configuration, the critical                         
              flashover voltage will be calculated using the                                 
              streamer (Raether) mechanism of air breakdown.                                 
              The effect of using insulator mounting hardware                                
              composed of a dielectric material as opposed to                                
              metal will be investigated to determine if any                                 
              significant improvement in the critical flashover                              
              voltage is realized.
