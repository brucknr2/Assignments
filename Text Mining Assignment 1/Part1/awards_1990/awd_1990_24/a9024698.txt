Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The objectives of the proposed work are:  (1) the                         
              measurement of the wave number spectra of gravity-capillary                    
              (water) waves using a site on Lake Washington, and (2) the                     
              measurement of heat and water vapor fluxes between the sea and                 
              the atmosphere during relatively low wind speeds in the                        
              subtropics (Azores).
