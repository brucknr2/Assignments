Abstract    :
                   The research will investigate the processing and properties               
              of superplastically deformed silicon nitride-based and mullite                 
              ceramic materials to develop constitutive relationships describing             
              the creep strain-deformation behavior of polycrystalline ceramics              
              and to develop processes for the superplastic forming of simple                
              components, including the gas blow-forming of ceramic sheets and               
              the diffusion bonding of superplastic ceramics.                                
                   Superplastic forming involves the slow deformation of the                 
              component into the desired shape at high temperatures and under                
              conditions under which fracture does not occur.  While superplastic            
              forming has been applied with some success to metallic materials,              
              titanium alloys in particular, the application of the process to               
              the forming of ceramics is highly novel.  Ceramic materials are                
              extremely difficult to form and finish, normally requiring grinding            
              operations which may damage the surface and cause failure.                     
              Therefore, the ability to deform solid ceramics into shaped parts              
              would be a major advance.
