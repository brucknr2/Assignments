Abstract    :
              The Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory of Columbia                          
              University will items of oceanographic instrumentation to                      
              be placed in a pool of shared use equipment.  This                             
              equipment is maintained for use on or in association with                      
              the research vessel MAURICE EWING that is operated by the                      
              Institution.  A substantial part of the ship's operating                       
              schedule in 1991 is in support of NSF-sponsored research                       
              projects.  The instrumentation will also increase the                          
              capabilities of the ships and of the institution to support                    
              research and engineering activities.  The instrumentation                      
              includes:                                                                      
                                                                                             
              -Shipboard data management systems and components for real-                    
               time acquisition, management, analysis, and display of                        
               large environmental and geophysical data sets,                                
              -A scientific control console for the multibeam bathymetric                    
               mapping system,                                                               
              -Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler electronics for                             
               providing continuous, underway measurements of subsurface                     
               circulation features, and dead-reckoning navigational                         
               input.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              The instrumentation described above will increase the                          
              capability of the organization to support NSF-sponsored                        
              research and engineering projects.
