Abstract    :
              Approximately 65 genera and 200 species of pteridophytes (ferns                
              and fern-allies) make up one-seventh of the Hawaiian higher plant              
              species and constitute a major segment of the vegetation.  Many of             
              the species are poorly known and many are rare, threatened, or                 
              endangered.  There are numerous systematic and distributional                  
              questions about these plants, and a modern survey and inventory of             
              them is urgently needed.  This will involve a comprehensive                    
              assessment of existing collections and detailed studies of the                 
              current populations in the wild, including new collections and data            
              on habitats.  The results of the inventory will form the basis of              
              a much-needed manual of Hawaiian ferns and fern-allies to parallel             
              recent volumes on the flowering plants.  Surveys will be made on               
              the main islands of Kauai, Oahu, Molokai, Lanai, Maui, and Hawaii.             
              The resulting specimens will be processed at the University of                 
              Michigan and the Bishop Museum, and duplicates distributed to other            
              appropriate herbaria.  A scientifically new manual will facilitate             
              numerous studies of biodiversity, evolution, and plant dispersal.              
              Conservationally the results will influence the preservation of                
              species and natural areas.
