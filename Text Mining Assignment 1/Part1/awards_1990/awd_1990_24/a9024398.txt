Abstract    :
              By 1995, Blacks and Hispanics are expected to make up about 28%                
              of college-age students in the U.S.  Considering the role science              
              and technology play in the world, the percentage of doctoral                   
              degrees awarded to minorities in the United States is alarmingly               
              low.                                                                           
              In order to have more minority students participating in these                 
              fields, as well as provide a vital background for those NOT                    
              choosing science careers, it is necessary to interest them in                  
              science and math at an early age.  This means that young children              
              who have a natural curiosity about everything around them must                 
              keep that curiosity and learn to see the connection of science                 
              and math with things that interest them.                                       
              The 1/2 hour film will address 7 to 12 year-olds and show that                 
              science and technology are present in some form in everything                  
              around them, and they have a connection with things children know              
              and like:  sports, TV, water, space, etc.
