Abstract    :
              Dr. Kenneth A. Goldsby of Florida State University is being                    
              supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic                   
              Program of the Chemistry Division to develop model compounds                   
              for proton-coupled electron transfer reactions.  The complexes                 
              will contain only one proton susceptible to transfer, thus                     
              assuring a single reversible pH-dependent couple.  The                         
              complexes synthesized will contain ruthenium (II) and ligands                  
              such as substituted imidazoles and related heterocyclic                        
              compounds, pyridine aldehydes, (pyrazolyl)pyridines, and                       
              diketones.  The mechanism of electron transfer will be studied                 
              using stopped-flow spectrscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and NMR                    
              line-broadening.  Also, bimetallic complexes in which changes                  
              in the pH can trigger reversible electron transfer between the                 
              metals will be prepared.                                                       
              %%%                                                                            
              By careful design, complexes will be "tuned" to effect electron                
              transfer at particular values of pH and potential.  This study                 
              may have application to molecular switches and to understanding                
              biological electron transfer reactions which involve a proton.
