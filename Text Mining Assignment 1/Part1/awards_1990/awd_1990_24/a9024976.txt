Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will develop an anlytical numerical method to                     
              predict the response of existing reinforced concrete and                       
              reinforced concrete masonry buildings subjected to wind                        
              and/or earthquake forces.  The method will be used to                          
              ascertain the safety of the buildings before and after                         
              repair or retrofit.
