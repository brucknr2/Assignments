Abstract    :
              This project addresses research in the dynamics and control of                 
              multiple arm manipulation.  A major difficulty in the                          
              implementation of multi arm systems is the complexity of the                   
              dynamic interactions between manipulators.  This project develops              
              an improved dynamics formulation which is expected to provide a                
              more efficient and physically meaningful model than currently                  
              available by closed chain approaches to multiple arm dynamics.                 
              The dynamics model is expected to to provide a clear, novel, and               
              computationally efficient method of dealing with both motion and               
              interaction effects at the joint level.  It is designed to                     
              clearly display the interactive forces without resorting to                    
              complex constraint equations.  Three phases of research are                    
              planned and include (1) development of a multiple manipulator                  
              dynamics model, (2) use of this model to develop new load                      
              distribution and control models, and (3) implementation and                    
              testing of the resulting algorithms on a dual arm laboratory                   
              facility.
