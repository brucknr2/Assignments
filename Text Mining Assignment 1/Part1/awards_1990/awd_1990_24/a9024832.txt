Abstract    :
                   This project will study the dynamical mechanisms by which                 
              the atmosphere can internally generate variability on timescales               
              of months, seasons, and years.  The focus will be on locating and              
              understanding the feedbacks between the low frequencies and the                
              shorter timescales at which the available energy of the                        
              atmosphere is released.  These investigations will be carried                  
              out in the context of simple two-level primitive equation model                
              and existing long runs of the NCAR Community Climate Model.  The               
              proposed work comprises the following specific studies:                        
                                                                                             
              1)  Studies of the "index cycle in the two-level model to                      
              determine its dynamics and its effects on stationary eddies.                   
              2)  Studies of the interactions between internal variability and               
              externally generated (by tropical heating) variability in the                  
              two-level model                                                                
              3)  Diagnostic analyses of extended simulations of the CCM to see              
              if the dynamical mechanisms that generate low-frequency                        
              variability in the two-level model are relevant in a more                      
              realistic model.                                                               
              4)  Analysis of the low-frequency variability of the Rossby wave               
              source in the CCM and its interaction with synoptic forcign of                 
              low-frequency features.                                                        
              5)  Studies of the dynamics of the inter-seasonal and longer                   
              timescale variability that is found at planetary spatial scales                
              in the two-level model.                                                        
                                                                                             
                   This research is important because its seeks to improve                   
              understanding of the processes responsible for climate variations              
              on time scales of great importance to human activities.
