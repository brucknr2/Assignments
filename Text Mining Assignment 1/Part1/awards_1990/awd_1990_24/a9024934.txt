Abstract    :
                   This research project in topology makes use of recent ideas               
              in theoretical physics, such as gauge theory and topological                   
              quantum field theories.  The results will have implications for                
              topology and geometry of 3-manifolds.                                          
                   Three-manifolds are very natural geometric objects.  In                   
              fact, ignoring the time dimension, we live in one.  For this                   
              reason, plumbing their deepest structure might have more than                  
              purely mathematical interest.//
