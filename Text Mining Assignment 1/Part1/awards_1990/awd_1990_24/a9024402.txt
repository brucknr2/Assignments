Abstract    :
              This research deals with the physics of novel superconducting                  
              microstructures: uniform submicron particles, mesoscopic interfface            
              structures, and magnetic flux coupled superlattices.  The research             
              employs novel vacuum deposition and micro-electronics fabrication              
              methods.  The research can lead to improved understanding of                   
              certain outstanding problems of high-Tc superconductors and the                
              fabrication of microstructures which exhibit new quantum                       
              interference phenomena.  Where appropriate, potential applications             
              of the research to superconducting devices will be explored.  The              
              submicron particles will be used in experiments to measure the                 
              temperature dependence of the penetration depth anisotropy,                    
              critical field enhancement and their relation to conduction                    
              anisotropy, interlayer coupling, pairing symmetry, and finite size             
              effects.  An experiment is proposed to determine the quasiparticle             
              energy spectra, and search for quantum interference effects in                 
              mesoscopic structures.  The flux coupling structures will                      
              potentially provide DC transformers with multiple secondaries and              
              large coupling ratios.
