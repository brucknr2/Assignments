Abstract    :
                 Dr. Long is a leading investigator in the area of nitrogen-                 
              fixing symbioses between bacteria and leguminous plants, focusing              
              on the identification and functions of bacterial genes involved in             
              the establishment of the symbiotic nodule.  The problem being                  
              addressed is the identification and characterization of a                      
              leguminous plant receptor for one of these bacterial gene products,            
              which is a transmembrane signalling molecule.                                  
                                                                                             
              This award is a National Science Foundation Faculty Award for Women            
              Scientists and Engineers.  The proposal fulfills the FAW                       
              objectives, which are: 1, to recognize outstanding and promising               
              women scientists and engineers in academic careers of research and             
              teaching and 2, to facilitate the further development of their                 
              careers.
