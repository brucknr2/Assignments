Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The purpose of this grant is to partially support the                          
              publication of the proceedings of the 13th International                       
              Colloquium on Dynamics of Explosions and Reactive Systems, to                  
              be held July, 1991, in Nagoya, Japan.  The colloquium deals                    
              with the interrelationship between rate processes of energy                    
              deposition in compressible media and their flow field, and                     
              with the nonsteady coupling between the flow system and the                    
              exothermic reactions in the course of combustion.  Papers will                 
              be focused on nonideal detonation phenomena, dust explosions,                  
              physical vapor explosions, explosion safety, ignition                          
              dynamics, chemical and dynamical flame effects, reactive                       
              compressible shear layers and heterogeneous combustion.                        
                                                                                             
              The Colloquium meets biannually and is an international forum                  
              of detonation and fluid dynamics.  The publication of the                      
              Proceedings, in English, makes a valuable contribution to the                  
              world literature in these important technological areas.
