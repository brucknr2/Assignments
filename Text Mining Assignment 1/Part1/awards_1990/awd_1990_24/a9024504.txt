Abstract    :
              The proposed work is a theoretical investigation into                          
              the optical wave properties and potential novel                                
              utilization of crystals having holographically recorded                        
              patterns.  These aspects will be considered from the                           
              perspective of applications requiring large                                    
              information capacities, such as optical interconnects                          
              and switches, optical data processing and computing                            
              elements, neural nets, and other.  In particular, the                          
              electromagnetic field interactions that take place                             
              inside such crystals will be explored in order to:  (a)                        
              characterize and evaluate the actual scattered fields                          
              produced by predetermined patterns, (b) investigate                            
              various effects that distort the desired form of such                          
              scattered fields, (c) assess the intrinsic limitations of                      
              the scattering mechanism, and (d) formulate optimal                            
              conditions for achieving optical processes of specific                         
              interest.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              For this purpose, the projected study will employ                              
              suitable canonic models of crystals containing patterns                        
              in the form of superposed gratings.  These will be                             
              examined by a recently developed technique, which                              
              views the pertinent multiple scattering problem in                             
              terms of Feynman diagrams that were modified and                               
              expressed as flow graphs.  By further extending and                            
              then applying this approach, accurate information on                           
              the complexity of the diffracted field will be derived.                        
              In turn, this information will be used to obtain                               
              qualitative and quantitative data on practical effects                         
              such as crosstalk interference, signal degradation due                         
              to crystal imperfections, realizable dynamic range of                          
              operation, deleterious effects due to interface                                
              boundaries, and other performance facets of relevant                           
              optical applications.
