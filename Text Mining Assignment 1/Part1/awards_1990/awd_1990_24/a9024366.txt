Abstract    :
              The Duke/UNC Oceanographic Consortium will acquire several                     
              items of oceanographic instrumentation to be placed in a pool                  
              of shared use equipment.  This equipment is maintained for                     
              use on or in association with the R/V CAPE HATTERAS, a                         
              research vessel owned by the NSF and operated by the                           
              Consortium.  A substantial part of the ship's operating                        
              schedule during 1991 is in support of NSF-sponsored research                   
              projects.  The instrumentation will also increase the                          
              capabilities of the ship and of the University to support                      
              research and engineering activities.  The instrumentation                      
              includes:                                                                      
              -MicroVAX minicomputer system, disk drive system and other                     
               peripheral equipment for shipboard data management that is                    
               essential for real-time acquisition and display of large                      
               data sets,                                                                    
              -Field and laboratory fluorometers for measuring chlorophyll                   
               and other optical properties in the water column,                             
              -upgrades for a digital data recording and processing system                   
               used for seismic surveys, and                                                 
              -Niskin bottles for collecting discrete seawater samples at                    
               various depths in the water column,                                           
                                                                                             
              The instrumentation described above will increase the                          
              capability of the Consortium to support NSF-sponsored                          
              research and engineering projects.
