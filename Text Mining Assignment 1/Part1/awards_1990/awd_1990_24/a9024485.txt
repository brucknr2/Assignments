Abstract    :
                   In an earlier research poject supported by the National                   
              Science Foundation, a triple-path denuder (TPD) assembly for                   
              ambient sampling of sulfate and/or nitrate compounds was                       
              constructed.  This device contains a series of denuders and                    
              filter packs which is intended to permit sampling and protection               
              of sulfate nitrate particles obtained from polluted urban                      
              atmospheres for species analysis by x-ray diffraction techniques.              
              In the current project, further laboratory tests are planned:  1)              
              the ability for this TPD instrument to collect artificially                    
              prepared aerosols of nitrates and sulfates; 2) to determine the                
              lower limit of detection of these materials; and 30 to assess the              
              extent to which the denuder systems of the TPD protect the                     
              samples from artifact reactions.  Additional sampling at Denver,               
              Colorado, is planned to test the system in actual field                        
              conditions where significant urban chemical products of this                   
              nature are known to occur.  The proposal also includes                         
              quantitative analysis of the collected particulate matter by x-                
              ray reference intensity and x-ray fluorescence procedures.
