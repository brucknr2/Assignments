Abstract    :
              Prof. Ault is supported by a grant from the Experimental                       
              Physical Chemistry Program to isolate and characterize the                     
              important chemical intermediates which are produced during                     
              chemical vapor deposition processes by trapping them in an                     
              ultracold solid argon matrix and identifying their molecular                   
              structure using spectroscopy.  These studies are important to                  
              the understanding of the mechanisms involved in chemical vapor                 
              deposition, one of the primary techniques used for growing thin                
              films and coatings used in the semiconductor industry for the                  
              fabrication of microelectronic devices and in solar energy                     
              conversion applications.                                                       
                                                                                             
              The unique capabilities of the matrix isolation technique will                 
              be exploited to isolate and characterize important chemical                    
              intermediates present during chemical vapor deposition (CVD)                   
              processes.  These results will enhance our knowledge of the                    
              chemical structure and bonding of these important, unusual                     
              chemical intermediates and will lead to an increased                           
              understanding of the homogeneous gas phase processes which are                 
              part of the reaction steps involved in CVD. The reaction                       
              pathways and intermediates will be examined for thermal and                    
              laser-induced CVD in III-V and II-VI semiconductor systems and                 
              also amorphous silicon.  Techniques auxiliary to matrix                        
              isolation will be employed as well, including cryogenic thin                   
              film formation, slow warmup spectroscopy, and gas phase                        
              infrared spectroscopy.
