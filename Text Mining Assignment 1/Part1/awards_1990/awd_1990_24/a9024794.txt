Abstract    :
                   This grant supports research to study nucleon                             
              interactions and nuclear dynamics with neutrons.  Nuclear                      
              reactions and scattering at neutron energies from 60 to 260                    
              MeV will be carried out at Crocker Nuclear Laboratory and Los                  
              Alamos National Laboratory for a range of nuclear targets.  In                 
              addition, studies of relativistic nuclear collisions centered                  
              at the Heavy Ion Superconducting Spectrometer at Lawrence                      
              Berkeley Laboratory will be augmented with a new time                          
              projection chamber, which is now under construction.
