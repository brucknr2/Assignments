Abstract    :
                   Two lines of research relevant to ionization and                          
              recombination processes in plasmas will be addressed, namely                   
              spectral line broadening and ionization equilibrium in a                       
              strongly magnetized plasma.                                                    
                   The impact theory of line broadening will be extended to                  
              include the effects or recombination on the line shape and an                  
              investigation will be made of those plasma regimes where such                  
              an extension of the impact theory is applicable.                               
                   Analysis of the effects of thermal motions, which create                  
              an electric field, will be made to determine their effect on                   
              the ionization balance via continuum lowering and tunnelling                   
              and decay of highly excited states.
