Abstract    :
              Freshwater systems are a major feature of the arctic landscape                 
              because permafrost prevents drainage, and evaporation is low.                  
              They must be studied and understood in their pristine condition                
              as a major part of the Arctic interacting system.  The broad goal              
              of the project is to understand and predict how the tundra, lakes              
              and streams function and how they respond to change.  A specific               
              goal is to understand the extent of control by resources (bottom-              
              up control) or by grazing and predation (top-down control) and to              
              understand the exchange of nutrients between land and water.  The              
              heart of the project is the long-term experimental manipulations               
              of ecosystems to examine processes and the effects of change.  A               
              part of the project is to monitor year-to-year variability and to              
              measure long-term changes.  The data collected in plots on the                 
              tundra and in small areas of the stream and lakes will be scaled               
              up to the whole watershed level through mathematical modeling.                 
              In the future, the watershed model will be interactive with other              
              data bases so the model and process information may be                         
              extrapolated to the larger region.  A prediction may then be made              
              for such questions as the future export of nutrients from the                  
              whole of the north slope of Alaska when temperature and                        
              precipitation changes.
