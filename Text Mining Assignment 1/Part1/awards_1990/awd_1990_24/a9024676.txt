Abstract    :
              This award will support collaborative research in solar                        
              system astronomy between Dr. Douglas Lin, University of                        
              California at Santa Cruz, and three British scientists:  Dr.                   
              Sverre Aarseth, Institute of Astronomy, Cambridge University,                  
              and Drs. John Papaloizou and Philip Palmer, School of                          
              Mathematical Sciences, Queen Mary and Westfield College,                       
              London.  The objective of the project is to investigate the                    
              formation of prototerrestrial planets and protogiant                           
              planetary cores in the solar nebula environment.                               
                                                                                             
              The specific tasks are:  1) to develop an analytical model                     
              for the dynamics of planetesimals, 2) to carry out N-body                      
              numerical simulations to examine the dynamical evolution and                   
              mass coagulation of planetesimals, 3) to investigate the                       
              effects of hydrodynamic drag and tidal interaction on the                      
              dynamics of planetesimals and protoplanets, and 4) to                          
              determine the dynamical impact of protoplanets on the                          
              structure and evolutions of the solar nebula.  These                           
              theoretical investigations will be carried out with the aid                    
              of analytic formalisms and numerical schemes recently                          
              developed by the investigators.  Data from solar system                        
              exploration and ground based observations of protostellar                      
              disks around young stellar objects will be used to constrain                   
              theoretical models. The project will benefit from the                          
              complementary expertise of the investigators and their                         
              successful history of past collaboration.  Results of this                     
              research will contribute to the understanding of the origin                    
              of the solar system, one of the most outstanding problems in                   
              astrophysics and planetary science.
