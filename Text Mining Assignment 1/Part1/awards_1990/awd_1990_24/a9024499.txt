Abstract    :
              This award funds initial research on integration of methods for                
              reflexive gait synthesis and adaptation to difficult terrains,                 
              for a biped walking robot.  The research will explore neural-                  
              network-based mechanisms for training a central pattern generator              
              to generate a new gait that is learned by a terrain-monitoring                 
              learning and adaptation unit.  It will also study the convergence              
              properties of backpropagation and reinforcement learning                       
              mechanisms for use in the learning and adaptation unit.  The                   
              long-term goal of this research in biped robotics is to achieve                
              more agility and mobility than is possible in multilegged walking              
              machines or other forms of machine locomotion, and ultimately to               
              provide capability for mobile robots to augment or replace humans              
              in hazardous operations or in rough terrain.
