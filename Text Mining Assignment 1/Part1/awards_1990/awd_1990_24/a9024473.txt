Abstract    :
              The use of sacrificial layers is a integral part of                            
              surface micromachining technology.  Currently,                                 
              silicon dioxide is the most widely used sacrificial                            
              layer material.  However, since hydrofluoric acid is                           
              needed to remove oxide sacrificial layers, many                                
              acid-sensitive metals such as aluminum and                                     
              chromium are not compatible with surface                                       
              micromachining schemes.                                                        
                                                                                             
              Phase I studies demonstrated that a new family of                              
              sacrificial layers materials termed alkali-soluble                             
              polyimides, or ASI's can be used to fabricate metal                            
              microdevices without the usual problems of metal                               
              attack.  ASI's were originally developed as                                    
              improved lift-off coatings for integrated circuit                              
              manufacturing processes.  They exhibit excellent                               
              high temperature stability an chemical resistance                              
              and, most importantly, they can be removed by                                  
              mild, noncorrosive enchants.  Removal occurs                                   
              rapidly without attendant swelling that can                                    
              jeopardize the integrity of overlying structures.                              
                                                                                             
              Phase II will investigate the basic relationships                              
              between polymer structure, etch bath chemistry,                                
              and a host of processing variables to understand                               
              how they control the behavior of ASI materials.                                
              The knowledge base will be invaluable for                                      
              developing successful ASI-based sacrificial layer                              
              products during Phase III.  These new products are                             
              expected to become an important part of the                                    
              polyimides business which is currently serving the                             
              microelectronics and optoelectronics industries.
