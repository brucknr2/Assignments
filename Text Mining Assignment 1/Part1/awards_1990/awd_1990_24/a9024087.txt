Abstract    :
              A robotic control system for automated container ship                          
              loading will be developed and tested in a computer                             
              simulation of the container loading process.  The key                          
              innovation is the combination of efficient feedforward                         
              control laws with a linear feedback based on both                              
              container and ship states.  The sensor system is an                            
              extension of the ship-tracking sensor suite developed in                       
              Phase I.                                                                       
              As demonstrated in Phase I, the technical problems                             
              associated with automation are (1) determining the                             
              precise position of the ship at the time of loading, (2)                       
              damping the pendulum motion of the suspended                                   
              container, and (3) compensating for the flexibility of                         
              the crane and cables.  The Phase II research will                              
              develop a ship/container sensor system, derive                                 
              mathematical models of system components, develop a                            
              control law, build and validate a computer model, and                          
              use it to verify the control system performance.                               
              The system can be retrofitted to existing cranes with                          
              suitable crane controls and mechanical sway damping,                           
              providing tremendous improvement and savings at a                              
              relatively small cost.  In Phase III a prototype working                       
              system on a ship load crane will be built, in cooperation                      
              with a consortium of major U.S. shipping lines and port                        
              authorities.
