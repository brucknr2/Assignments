Abstract    :
              The design, analysis, and implementation of algorithms for the                 
              solution of sparse matrix problems on distributed memory                       
              multiprocessors will be investigated. The development of these                 
              parallel sparse matrix algorithms should have an impact of challenging         
              large-scale computational problems in several scientific, econometric,         
              and engineering disciplines.                                                   
                                                                                             
              The following are among the problems that will be investigated:                
                                                                                             
                o           A spectral nested dissection algorithm for computing             
                            good orderings for factoring sparse matrices efficiently         
                            in parallel,                                                     
                                                                                             
                o           Algorithms for mapping computational subtasks and the            
                            given matrix to the processors in a distributed memory           
                            multiprocessor,                                                  
                                                                                             
                o           The role played by the clique tree, a data structure for         
                            the compact representation of filled matrices, in                
                            several sparse matrix algorithms, and                            
                                                                                             
                o           The design of sparse orthogonal factorization algorithms         
                            for the solution of least-squares problems on                    
                            distributed memory multiprocessors.
