Abstract    :
              Hypogeous fungi (truffles and false truffles) are ideal organisms              
              for studying the relationships of fungi and their plant hosts.                 
              These fungi form obligate, ectomycorrhizal associations with trees             
              and are also dependent on rodents for spore dispersal.  The Great              
              Basin is an ideal setting for such studies because hypogeous fungi             
              are found in widely scattered forest "islands" separated by                    
              inhospitable desert lacking appropriate ectomycorrhizal hosts to               
              serve as "stepping-stones" for dispersal between islands.  A survey            
              on hypogeous fungi on forest islands in the Great Basin, an area               
              of 714,854 sq. km., is proposed to supplement the 1500 collections,            
              virtually, the only collections from most of the Great Basin, that             
              have been amassed from limited collecting in the area.  Data from              
              the collections will be used to expand an existing database,                   
              produce a hypogeous mycoflora of the region, and test several                  
              theories of biogeography and evolutionary biology.  In addition,               
              information from the specimens will be valuable in selecting fungi             
              for artificial inoculation of tree seedlings for reforestation in              
              the Great Basin.  The data will also be useful to wildlife managers            
              interested in the dietary items available to small mammals.  The               
              specimens themselves will provide DNA for testing phylogenetic                 
              relationships, factors controlling macrospeciation, and the genetic            
              structure of isolated populations of hypogeous fungi.
