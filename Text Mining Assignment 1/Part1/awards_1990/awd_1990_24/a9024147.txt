Abstract    :
              This award provides support to Dr. Nancy Rose under the National               
              Science Foundation's Faculty Awards for Women Scientists and                   
              Engineers Program.  The objectives of this program are to                      
              recognize the nation's most outstanding and promising women                    
              scientists and engineers in academic careers in research and                   
              teaching, to retain them in academia, and to facilitate the                    
              further development of their careers.                                          
                                                                                             
              This award will allow the investigator to pursue two important                 
              projects.  The first involves the investigation of three major                 
              questions in the area of industrial organization, making use of                
              the wealth of data created by airline regulation and the policy                
              shock created by deregulation in 1978.  The questions to be                    
              analyzed are: (1) What is the extent of price discrimination and               
              how is it affected by market structure?  (2) What determines                   
              firms' product quality choices?  and (3) How does entry into                   
              markets affect competitive interactions and what does this reveal              
              about theories of oligopoly behavior?                                          
                                                                                             
              The second project will explore the impact of government risk                  
              management on firms in the financial service sector.  The                      
              questions to be analyzed include  (1) What managerial objectives               
              do financial service firms pursue? and (2) How did the increased               
              competition resulting from the regulatory reforms and technology               
              changes of the late 1970's and early 1980's affect bank and                    
              thrift portfolio risk strategies?  This research will develop                  
              empirical models of firm's risk preference behavior that will be               
              interest both to scholars studying firm behavior and to policy                 
              makers interested in designing effective government risk                       
              management strategies.
