Abstract    :
              The goal of the work is development of a simple reproducible                   
              method for assaying for the presence of functional ion channels                
              in planar lipid bilayers.  Improving upon liposomal ion flux                   
              assays and electrical measurements employing BLMs, patch                       
              electrodes, or whole cells would greatly facilitate routine                    
              testing for ion channel activity in biophysical and biochemical                
              research.  The technique of patch clamping bilayers formed from                
              monolayers would serve well if it were not so irreproducible.  We              
              propose to test a new approach at forming stable planar bilayers               
              that will lend itself well to such a new assay system--this is to              
              support bilayers on planar hydrophilic surfaces perforated by                  
              small single orifices containing one Ag/AgCl electrode each.                   
              First we will fabricate planar silicon and glass structures with               
              small hydrophilic holes.  Lipid bilayers will then be formed                   
              across those holes by passing the device twice through an                      
              air-water interface covered by a lipid monolayer with or without               
              ion channels.  Measurement of the function of the nicotinic                    
              acetylcholine receptor in such bilayers will be made with                      
              conventional electrophysiological techniques.
