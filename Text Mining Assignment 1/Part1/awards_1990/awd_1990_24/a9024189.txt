Abstract    :
              The University of Michigan's Center for Great Lakes & Aquatic                  
              Sciences will acquire several items of oceanographic                           
              instrumentation to be placed in a pool of shared use equipment.                
              This equipment is maintained for use on or in association with                 
              the R/V LAURENTIAN, a research vessel owned and operated by the                
              University.  A substantial part of the ship's operating schedule               
              during 1991 is in support of NSF-sponsored research projects.                  
              The instrumentation will also increase the capabilities of the                 
              ship and of the University to support research and engineering                 
              activities.  The instrumentation includes:                                     
                                                                                             
              -Side-scan sonar system for mapping details of bottom                          
               morphology that are useful in studies of sedimentation and                    
               the distribution of various objects and structures, and                       
              -Niskin bottles for collecting discrete seawater samples at                    
               various depths in the water column,                                           
                                                                                             
              The instrumentation described above will increase the capability               
              of the University to support NSF-sponsored research and                        
              engineering projects.
