Abstract    :
                   The researcher will investigate: 1) whether substrate                     
              enhancement occurs with other xenobiotic compounds, particularly               
              other substituted phenols (chloro- and methyl-) which are among the            
              more mobile hazardous contaminants; 2) the effect of a single                  
              supplemental substrate on degradation of a mixture of two or more              
              xenobiotic compounds by bacterial consortia in cell recycle                    
              systems; 3) if large populations of degrading bacteria can be                  
              maintained in a biofilm growing on inert particles without  added              
              supplemental feed; 4) whether the activated sludge floc or biofilm             
              morphology protects individual bacteria from toxicity effects of               
              xenobiotic compounds.                                                          
                   After the laboratory experiment, the nominee will carry out               
              simulations at pilot- or demonstration-scale.  These will allow the            
              P.I. to investigate the effects of mixing, aeration and biomass                
              separation, variables that are best studies in large scale, and to             
              verify the predictive models on large biodegradation systems.                  
                   One benefit of this research is that phenomena identified in              
              pure bacterial cultures can be researched in mixed populations.                
              Usually this application is made by engineers without research on              
              the mechanism in mixed communities of microorganisms which develop             
              in nonsterile field processes.  A second benefit is the                        
              investigation of non-specific enhancement mechanisms, like the                 
              growth of floc particles to retain bacteria, so that a single                  
              biodegradation process can be used in many contaminant removal                 
              systems.  Finally, some conditions which greatly affect                        
              biodegradation cannot be studied in bench-scale simulations.  Doing            
              research at a larger scale will help to avoid process failures                 
              which occur when scale-up effects are not understood.
