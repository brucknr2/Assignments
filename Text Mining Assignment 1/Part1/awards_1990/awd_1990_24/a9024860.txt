Abstract    :
              With the growth in concerns about the potential societal impacts               
              of global environmental changes such as greenhouse warming, most               
              efforts have concentrated on climate monitoring and modeling.  To              
              date, there have been but limited efforts to improve our                       
              understanding of the economic and social impacts of the                        
              greenhouse effect.  This project continues collaborative work                  
              designed to improve understanding of both substantive and                      
              methodological developments concerning the economic and social                 
              impacts of global change.  It involves a substantive research                  
              program to study the impacts of global climate change and an                   
              annual conference to review ongoing research in the social                     
              sciences on the impacts of global environmental change.  The                   
              specific research will continue studies of the impacts in two                  
              areas:  (1) the collection of a data base for the United States                
              that combines climatic and economic data, particularly                         
              agricultural data, on a county level; and (2) use of the county                
              climate and economic data base to estimate the impact of climate               
              and climate change on economic activity.
