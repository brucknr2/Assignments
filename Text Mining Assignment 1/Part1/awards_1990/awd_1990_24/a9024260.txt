Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports the continuation of the detailed study of                  
              low-mass (i.e., like the Sun) star formation. Given sufficient mass            
              to overcome the thermal and turbulent pressures in the interstellar            
              medium, a condensing protostellar object forms with a disk                     
              surrounding it.  That disk spins because of conservation of angular            
              momentum, and some of that angular momentum may be transferred to              
              the young stellar object.  Magnetic fields seem to play some role              
              in the transfer.  Strong winds also emanate, but whether from the              
              disk or the protostar is not known.  Dr. Shu will study the                    
              structure and evolution of the winds, magnetic evolution,                      
              gravitational instabilities, collapse of an isothermal sphere, and             
              disks around O stars.                                                          
                                                                                             
              About 5 billion years ago our Sun, with its attending planets, was             
              formed from an interstellar medium enriched by previous stellar                
              deaths:  stars send their remains into the surrounding medium to               
              await the next cycle of local star formation.  Understanding the               
              evolution of galaxies requires understanding these cycles.                     
              Understanding the evolution of a universe made of galaxies means               
              that we must first understand how stars form in our own Galaxy.                
              This proposed research will take another large step along that                 
              path.
