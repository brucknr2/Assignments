Abstract    :
              This research will address several specific areas of secondary                 
              metabolite biosynthesis in blue-green algae. The first group of                
              compounds to be investigated includes the potent                               
              anticholinesterase anatoxin-a(s) from Anabaena flos-aquae, the                 
              hepatotoxic cyclic peptides microcystin-LR from Microcytis                     
              aeruginosa and nodularin from Nodularia spumigena, the                         
              neurotoxic alkaloids anatoxin-a and homoanatoxin-a from                        
              Oscillatoria agardhii, and the inflammatory agents lyngbyatoxin                
              A and debromoaplysiatoxin from Lyngbya majuscula. Studies also                 
              will be carried out on the isolation, structure determination                  
              and biosynthesis of new toxins from cyanophytes. The second                    
              major area will focus on a continuation of studies on the                      
              biosynthesis of hapalindole A, a fungicidal indole alkaloid                    
              from Hapalosiphon fontinalis, and tolytoxin, mirabilene A                      
              isonitrile, mirabimide E, and tantazole B, representatives of                  
              four classes of structurally unique and diverse natural                        
              products from Scytonema mirabile. Studies in a third area will                 
              involve the biosynthesis of cylindrocyclophane A from                          
              Cylindrospermum licheniforme, the first ?m,n!paracyclophane to                 
              be found in Nature, and an extracellular substance which                       
              stimulates sporulation in C. licheniforme. Finally studies will                
              be carried out on the isolation, structure determination, and                  
              biosynthesis of other unusual natural products from blue-green                 
              algae, e.g. synechocin, an antiviral compound from the marine                  
              cyanophyte Synechococcus elongatus, and new alkaloids from                     
              cyanophytes belonging to the Stigonematales.                                   
                                                                                             
              %%%                                                                            
                                                                                             
              With this award the Synthetic Organic Program of the Chemistry                 
              Division will support the research of Dr. Richard E. Moore of                  
              the Department of Chemistry at the University of Hawaii, Manoa.                
              The major goal of the research is to understand the                            
              biosynthesis of secondary metabolites in blue-green algae,                     
              especially freshwater, brackish-water, and marine cyanophytes                  
              which produce toxins implicated in wildlife, domestic animal,                  
              and human poisonings.
