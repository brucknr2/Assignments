Abstract    :
                   The Vertebrate Paleontology collection of the Oklahoma                    
              Museum of Natural History includes more that 30,000 specimens,                 
              collected primarily from the southern plains of the U.S.   The                 
              collection is an important regional repository for fossil                      
              vertebrates, and ranks 15th among U.S. collections of its type.                
              Most of the collection was amassed during the 1930s and 1940s                  
              under the direction of J. Willis Stovall, first Director of the                
              Museum.  Following his death in 1953 the collection was neglected              
              and fell into disrepair, but through the efforts of Dr. Richard                
              Cifelli, appointed as Curator in 1986, the collection has been                 
              restored to a high level of activity.  Approximately one-fourth                
              of the collection has been restored, cataloged, reorganized, and               
              transferred to modern storage cabinets.  Dr. Cifelli proposes                  
              another phase in the collection's restoration, during which                    
              fossils of Cenozoic age (mostly mammals) will also be brought to               
              a high level of curation.                                                      
                   The proposed collection improvement project will salvage an               
              important research collection, and will make it easily accessible              
              to visiting investigators and through loans.  Natural history                  
              collections such as this are essential resources for research on               
              evolution, biogeography, and global change.  Continued growth and              
              improvement of these collections will benefit many generations of              
              researchers.
