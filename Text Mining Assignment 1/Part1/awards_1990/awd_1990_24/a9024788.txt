Abstract    :
                   Various problems in the set theory of the real line will be               
              investigated.  These problems involve independence and                         
              consistency results in axiomatic set theory.  This means that the              
              problem is to show that some particular statement cannot be                    
              proved from the usual axioms of set theory.                                    
                   The main technique used is forcing.  The forcing method was               
              first invented by Paul J. Cohen in the sixties to show that the                
              continuum hypothesis is independent of the usual axioms of set                 
              theory.  It has since been used to show many problems not only of              
              set theory, but also algebra, topology, and analysis are                       
              independent of the usual axioms of set theory.                                 
                   Two areas of the set theory of the real line will be                      
              investigated.  The first area considers properties of Lebesgue                 
              measure and Baire category on the real line as well as some                    
              ideals which are less well known.  The second area is to                       
              investigate pathological or peculiar subsets of the real line.                 
                   Understanding set theoretic properties of the real line has               
              obvious foundational significance.  It has also transpired that                
              methods developed for this purpose inspire analogues which work                
              in the context of theoretical computer science.
