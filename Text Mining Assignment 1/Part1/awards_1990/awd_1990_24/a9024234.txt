Abstract    :
              The surface segregation of polymer chains in melts due to molecular            
              weight effects has important consequences in determining the                   
              mechanical resilience of composite materials.  It is thus suggested            
              that the surface behavior of apparently simple blends such as                  
              isotopic mixtures are more complicated than thought before.  In the            
              second case they considered the surface behavior of a binary blend,            
              in which all segments of one chain interact identically with the               
              surface, while the end moieties of the second species have                     
              energetic interactions with the surface that are different from the            
              central beads.  Their preliminary experiments suggest, in agreement            
              with theory, that the appropriate tailoring of these end-moieties              
              will dictate which component will partition to a substrate                     
              interface.  Experimentally, they propose to conduct more detailed              
              experiments on these systems primarily through the use of a new                
              technique, neutron reflectivity, to obtain a better understanding              
              of the physics in these interfacial situations.  They have shown               
              that mean-field lattice calculations cannot enumerate the behavior             
              of isotopic polymers and therefore propose to conduct off-lattice              
              Monte Carlo simulations on these systems to delineate their                    
              behavior.
