Abstract    :
              This Faculty Award for Women Scientist is for Research in the                  
              area of natural language processing.  This particular research                 
              focusses on the problem of word choice and on the user of a                    
              unification formalism to implement and represent generation                    
              decisions, including syntactic processes, word choice, and                     
              content planning. The Principle Investigator is testing                        
              previously developed language generation techniques as part of                 
              one or more generation systems.  These include interactive                     
              question answering and multimedia system, as well as systems that              
              can generate financial reports.//
