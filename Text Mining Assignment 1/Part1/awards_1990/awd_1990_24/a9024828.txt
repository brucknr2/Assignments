Abstract    :
              The proposed work is part of an integrated research program into               
              the oceanographic structure of the western Weddell Sea.  It is to              
              be carried out from an ice camp jointly occupied by U.S. and USSR              
              scientists from February to June 1992.  This project concerns the              
              regional-scale circulation and the variability of the Weddell SEa              
              boundary current.  Five moorings consisting of two current meters              
              each will be suspended from the ice at 50 kilometer intervals in               
              a line normal to the mean direction of the current.  The upper                 
              current meters will within Polar Surface Water, while the lower                
              meters will be within the warmer Weddell Warm Water.  This array               
              will complement a series of taut wire moorings to be emplaced by               
              the German Antarctic Program in the central Weddell Sea.
