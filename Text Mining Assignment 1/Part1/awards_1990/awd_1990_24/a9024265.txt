Abstract    :
              This project will supply shipboard scientific equipment for the                
              research vessels T. THOMPSON and C.A BARNES, operated by the                   
              University of Washington, School of Oceanography and                           
              dedicated to use in support of ocean science research.                         
                                                                                             
              The Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment Program provides funds              
              for ship equipment deemed essential to the proper and safe                     
              conduct of ocean science research. This Program provides support               
              for such items as deck equipment including winch systems for the               
              deployment and retrieval of scientific instruments, navigational               
              equipment such as radars, gyroscopes and earth satellite                       
              receivers to pin point the location of research sites,                         
              communication equipment including radio transceivers and                       
              satellite transceivers for voice and scientific data                           
              communications and other equipment such as motorized workboats                 
              for transporting scientists to and from data retrieval sites.                  
                                                                                             
              The Project Director, Arthur R. Nowell is fully qualified to                   
              direct this project having had considerable experience in                      
              overseeing the acquisition and installation of shipboard                       
              equipment.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              This project will allow the institution to acquire a portable                  
              winch, upgrade navigational equipment and replace a worn out work              
              boat for the BARNES, and obtain a cable fault detector for the                 
              THOMPSON.
