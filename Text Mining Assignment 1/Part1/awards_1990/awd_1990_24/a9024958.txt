Abstract    :
              This award supports the establishment of a working group for                   
              the science planning of the prospective initiative:  Pole-                     
              to-Pole Paleoclimate Transect for the Western Hemisphere                       
              ?"Pole-Equator-Pole", the PEP Working Group!.  This effort                     
              will link regional paleoclimatic records in a north-south                      
              latitudinal transect to explore interhemispheric                               
              paleoclimatic connections and increase our understanding of                    
              the latitudinal structures of climate change.  The proposed                    
              working group would formalize a detailed science plan for                      
              this initiative, identify gaps in the scientific effort,                       
              assess the results of prior field, laboratory and modeling                     
              studies, and insure integration of interdisciplinary  and                      
              international efforts.
