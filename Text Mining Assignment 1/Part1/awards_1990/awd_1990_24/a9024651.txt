Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The investigators propose continued operation and                         
              development of the Flatland Radar Observatory, near Champaign-                 
              Urbana, Illinois.  The principle instrument at the Flatland                    
              Observatory is the 50 MHz ST radar; it is presently supported by               
              a surface meteorological station, a radiosonde, and an array of                
              eight microbarographs.  This instrumentation will be supplemented              
              with a 915 MHz lower tropospheric radar and an accompanying Radio              
              Acoustic Sounding System (RASS) to measure wind and temperature                
              profiles in the lower troposphere.                                             
                                                                                             
                   The scientific objectives are:  (1) to investigate mesoscale              
              dynamical processes in the troposphere and lower stratosphere and              
              their effects on larger scale dynamics; (2) to study microscale                
              processes, including turbulence and stratified irregularities of               
              refractive index, and to assess their effects on the accuracy and              
              precision of ST radar measurements; and (3) to assess the                      
              capabilities of the ST radar technique, particularly its                       
              potential for measuring vertical velocities over extended times.
