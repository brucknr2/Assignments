Abstract    :
                   The principal investigators will study three problems in                  
              symbolic dynamics pertaining to topological classification and                 
              automorphisms of subshifts of finite type: (i) characterize strong             
              shift equivalence for subsemirings of the nonnegative rational                 
              numbers, (ii) develop tools to understand the Williams conjecture              
              over the nonnegative real numbers, and (iii) determine whether                 
              given permutations of the fixed points of a subshift are induced by            
              an automorphism.                                                               
                   This award will support research in a branch of ergodic theory            
              called symbolic dynamics.  A symbolic dynamical system is a                    
              collection of two way infinite strings of symbols from a finite                
              alphabet with a rule of formation which specifies which symbols can            
              follow one another.  A central theme in this area is the                       
              classification of such systems with respect to various forms of                
              equivalence.  Symbolic dynamical systems have recently found                   
              application in the modelling of data transmission.
