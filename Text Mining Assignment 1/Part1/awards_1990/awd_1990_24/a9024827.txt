Abstract    :
                   Heating and modification of the ionosphere by powerful HF                 
              heaters have been recognized to be a powerful means to study the               
              nonlinear plasma  physics and to understand the internal dynamics              
              of the ionosphere.  The proposed program is aimed at developing                
              theories for better understanding of the experimental                          
              observations with particular reference to: (a) height difference               
              between HFPLs and natural lines and the correlation between                    
              HFPLs and field-aligned irregularities; (b) frequency upshifted                
              HFPLs and their organization altitude; (c) plasma lines overshoot              
              and expansion of originating altitude interval of HFPLs; and  (d)              
              generation of electron Bernstein modes as the source waves of                  
              secondary simulated EM emission.  New experiments will be                      
              initiated whenever they are feasible.  The approach will be based              
              on our earlier and recent works that include the study of thermal              
              flamentation instability of field-aligned Langmuir wave,                       
              evolution of HFPLs and the study of various parametric                         
              instability processes.  We also propose to study the effects of                
              the ionospheric plasma inhomogeneity on the results of HF heating              
              experiments.   ***
