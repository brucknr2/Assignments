Abstract    :
              Terrestrial and marine ecology are disciplines that have                       
              developed with far too few points of contact, given the common                 
              conceptual and methodological issues, as well as more recent                   
              environmental concerns.  A preliminary meeting (Santa Fe 1989)                 
              identified eight cross-sectoral topics where further                           
              interaction would be valuable in advancing our understanding                   
              of ecological systems in general.  This month-long summer                      
              institute on spatial patterning and patch dynamics will mark                   
              the first of a potential series with the aim of comparing and                  
              contrasting terrestrial and marine ecological systems and the                  
              ways in which they are investigated.
