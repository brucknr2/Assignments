Abstract    :
              This Faculty Award for Women Scientists is for research on object              
              oriented database systems.  Features of these systems include:                 
              object identity; supporting complex objects; encapsulation;                    
              classes and types; and inheritance.  There have been several                   
              attempts to combine object oriented with deductive approaches in               
              order to derive a data model that retains the advantages of                    
              object orientedness while having a declarative language with                   
              formal semantics.  This research develops a declarative language               
              for the object oriented data model.  It includes novel features                
              such as meta-variables and named values.  Meta variables allow a               
              rule language to have method inheritance naturally, and also                   
              facilitates parametric inheritance.  Named values bridge the                   
              concepts of value and object.
