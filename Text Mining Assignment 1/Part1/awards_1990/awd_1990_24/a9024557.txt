Abstract    :
              This is collaborative research with Hans Berliner at Carnegie                  
              Mellon University (IRI-9105202).  Game-playing is an important                 
              domain for two reasons:  first, it exhibits in a clean form two                
              of the major problems facing AI systems, namely how to pay                     
              attention to only a small fraction of the possibilities in                     
              complex domains, and how to use a large quantity of evidential                 
              information to make decisions; second, it has long been                        
              considered a litmus test for ideas about problem solving and for               
              the quality of AI ideas in general, particularly in comparison to              
              human intelligence.  Recent work on control of search by Russell               
              and Wefald and on probabilistic inference in problem solving                   
              domains by Hansson and Mayer, suggests that the PI's will be able              
              to break the grip of brute-force methods on high-performance                   
              systems.  The object of the proposed research is to test out                   
              these ideas, with a view to demonstrating feasibility of an                    
              intelligent chess program with the potential to perform at a high              
              level.  Should the effort succeed, the PI's will continue with a               
              concerted attempt to defeat the human world champion.  The purely              
              scientific benefits should be significant, in terms of                         
              demonstrating the feasibility of large-scale probabilistic                     
              inference and metalevel control; the benefits to the field of AI               
              in the larger national context will be immeasurable, since                     
              several influential critics will be disarmed, and success will                 
              avoid the extremely deleterious conclusion the "all your need for              
              AI is faster chips".
