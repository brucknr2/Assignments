Abstract    :
                   The principal investigators undertake studies of a variety                
              of problems in mechanics and biology, using techniques of                      
              nonlinear dynamical systems. The topics include the dynamics of                
              dissipative partial differential equations and pattern formation               
              in fluid systems, global dynamics of symmetric systems, knots and              
              orbit genealogy in three-dimensional flows, dynamics of                        
              oscillators with slowly varying potentials, modelling of                       
              neurobiological oscillators, iterations of one-dimensional                     
              mappings, nonlinear stability and bifurcation in Hamiltonian and               
              weakly damped systems. Arnold diffusion in four-dimensional                    
              symplectic maps, and dynamics of the growth of certain plants.                 
                   These topics have applications in the design and development              
              of "smart" materials, in aerospace (particularly satellites and                
              spacecraft), in the control of turbulent boundary layers,and in                
              biology.
