Abstract    :
              This award will support the activities of an interdisciplinary                 
              team of researchers in terms of maintenance of the Conneciton                  
              Machine of the UCLA Cognitive Science Research Program.  The                   
              research resulting from this support will be in the following six              
              areas:  (a) language processing, which includes reasoning,                     
              planning, inference and search, (b) evolutionary studies in the                
              newly emerging paradigm of artificial life, (c) simulation                     
              studies of neural networks - both synthetic and neurally                       
              plausible - for modeling memory, learning, language and vision,                
              (d) parallel algorithms for biological image processing, for                   
              example, the manipulation of MRI images, (e) research in the                   
              fundamental mathematics and logic of parallel computation, such                
              as the development of parallel programming language semantics,                 
              and (f) the use of parallel algorithms for scientific computing.               
                                                                                             
              This award will support the activities of an interdisciplinary                 
              team of researchers in terms of maintenance of the Conneciton                  
              Machine of the UCLA Cognitive Science Research Program.  The                   
              research resulting from this award will be in  cognitive sciences              
              and in the development of parallel computation.
