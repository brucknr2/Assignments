Abstract    :
                   This project will develop coherent structures in nonlinear                
              problems and obtain solutions to equations arising in physical                 
              problems.  The techniques to be employed include asymptotic and                
              perturbation analysis, numerical computation, and exact solutions.             
              Especially important in the realm of exact analysis is the method              
              of inverse scattering transform.                                               
                   This work has generic features and, consequently, broad                   
              applicability.  Examples of applications include wave propagation              
              in surface and internal waves, self focussing and soliton                      
              propagation in nonlinear optics, exact reductions of Einstein's                
              vacuum equations, and aspects on numerical computation.
