Abstract    :
                   Professor Zhu will continue his research on the structure of              
              Toeplitz, Hankel, and composition operators in various function                
              spaces.  This part of the project will concentrate on deriving                 
              information and estimates in terms of the symbol of the operator.              
              A related project concerns the investigation of the nodal sets of              
              analytic functions in Bergman and Fock spaces.  Here Zhu will                  
              collaborate with Hedenmalm who has just made an important                      
              breakthrough in this area.                                                     
                    Operators are essentially infinite matrices of complex                   
              numbers.  They have applications in every area of applied science              
              as well as in pure mathematics.  This type of research is an                   
              attempt to classify certain important families of such objects and             
              to make contact with the theory of analytic functions.
