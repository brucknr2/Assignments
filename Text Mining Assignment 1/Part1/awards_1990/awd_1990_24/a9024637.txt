Abstract    :
              This research is centered in the areas of thermomechanics and the              
              mechanics of solids.  It is especially concerned with nonlinear                
              constitutive theory, and most of the issues are related to the                 
              notion of materials stability.  When certain bodies are loaded, or             
              heated, or placed in a chemical environment or electrical field,               
              they will experience transformations such as materials symmetry                
              changes and domain switching, local strain concentrations,                     
              buckling, bifurcation of their equilibrium field structure, or                 
              catastrophic swelling or collapse.  These transformations often                
              have pronounced effects and can be used to story energy and toughen            
              or weaken materials, they can cause anomalous behavior of                      
              characteristic material moduli, permit polymeric gels to react as              
              muscle fibers, and aid in the storage of light images in                       
              ferroelectric crystals.  This program emphasizes the theoretical               
              investigation of fundamental problems concerning materials that                
              exhibit such phenomenological behavior.
