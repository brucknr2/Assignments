Abstract    :
              This grant supports a conference at the National Bureau of Economic            
              Research in Cambridge, Massachusetts on November 29-30th on                    
              environmental economics.  The meeting has three objectives: (1) to             
              make researchers in fields related to environmental economics aware            
              of the links between their work and environmental issues, thereby              
              stimulating research in the area of environmental policy and global            
              change; (2) to acquaint U.S. economists with the nature of funding             
              opportunities, both from NSF and from other sources, for research              
              on environmental policy; (3) to encourage collaborative research               
              by teams of U.S. and European economists with similar interests.               
                                                                                             
              This conference is very timely.  Public interest in environmental              
              issues increased sharply in the late 1980's.  The national and                 
              international policy agenda now includes important new initiatives             
              on air and water pollution, global warming, preservation of the                
              ozone layer, and the disposal of solid waste.  Many of the basic               
              issues in this area cut across other sub-fields within economics,              
              including public finance, industrial organization, international               
              economics, and labor economics.
