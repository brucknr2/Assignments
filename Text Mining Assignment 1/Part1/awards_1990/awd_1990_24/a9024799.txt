Abstract    :
              This planning grant, submitted in conjunction with the Minority                
              Research Initiation program of the NSF, will provide for support               
              to develop a research proposal to address a Simulated Modelling                
              Process (SMP).   SMP is useful because general purpose simulation              
              languages required in simulation models of many manufacturing                  
              systems do not adequately represent the complexity and detail found            
              in such systems.
