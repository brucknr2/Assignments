Abstract    :
                   The principal investigators will continue their successful                
              research program in various topics of current interest in complex              
              fuction theory.  In particular, Professor Bank will work on the                
              properties of solutions of complex ordinary differential                       
              equations pertaining to growth and oscillation.  Professor                     
              Kaufman will work on problems involving conformal mapping,                     
              measure theory and descriptive set theory and on problems in                   
              abstract harmonic analysis.  And Professor Wu will work on                     
              problems involving Green's functions in multi-dimensional domains              
              and growth properties along certain curves and on problems in                  
              parabolic potential theory.
