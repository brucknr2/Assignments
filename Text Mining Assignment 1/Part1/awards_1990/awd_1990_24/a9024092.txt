Abstract    :
              The University of Southern California will acquire several                     
              items of oceanographic instrumentation to be placed in a pool                  
              of shared use equipment.  This equipment is maintained for                     
              use on or in association with the R/V VICKERS, a research                      
              vessel owned and operated by the University.  A part of the                    
              ship's operating schedule during 1991 is in support of NSF-                    
              sponsored research projects.  The instrumentation will also                    
              increase the capabilities of the ship and of the University                    
              to support research and engineering activities.  The                           
              instrumentation includes:                                                      
                                                                                             
              -Seagoing computer, disk drive system and other peripheral                     
               equipment for a shipboard data management system that is                      
               essential for real-time acquisition and display of large                      
               data sets,                                                                    
              -CTD system for obtaining detailed profiles of seawater                        
               conductivity and temperature as a function of depth, and a                    
              -Rosette sampler with Niskin bottles for collecting discrete                   
               seawater samples at various depths in the water column.                       
                                                                                             
              The instrumentation described above will increase the                          
              capability of the University to support NSF-sponsored                          
              research and engineering projects.
