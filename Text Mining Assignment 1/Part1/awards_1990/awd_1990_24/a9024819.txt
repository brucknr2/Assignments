Abstract    :
              In recent discussions of the roles of experimental evidence in                 
              science, there have been two opposing positions.  Dr. Franklin,                
              along with others, has argued for an "evidence model" of science               
              in which questions concerning theory choice, confirmation,                     
              refutation, etc. are decided on the basis of valid experimental                
              evidence.  Others have argued that science is merely a social                  
              construction, and that the social and/or cognitive interests of                
              the scientific community play the major role, with experimental                
              evidence playing at most a minor role.  Dr. Franklin, under this               
              grant, is investigating further arguments in favor of the "evidence            
              model."  He believes that by considering the context of pursuit,               
              the reasons why scientists pursue a particular research program,               
              rather than the context of justification, one might be able to                 
              reconcile the two views.                                                       
                                                                                             
              This work continues the current trend in history and philosophy of             
              science of considering the actual practice of science.  On the                 
              basis of this work as well as work by other philosophers and                   
              historians, Dr. Franklin hopes to present a more complete                      
              philosophy of experiment.
