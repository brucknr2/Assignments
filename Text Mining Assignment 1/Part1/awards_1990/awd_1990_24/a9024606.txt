Abstract    :
              This award supports the participation of twelve U.S. chemists in a             
              U.S.-German workshop in analytical chemistry to be held in mid-May,            
              1991, at The Pennsylvania State University.  The meeting is organized          
              jointly by Professor Nicholas Winograd of Penn State and Professor             
              Hans Oechsner of the University of Kaiserslautern.  It is supported            
              jointly by NSF and its German counterpart, the Deutsche Forschungs-            
              gemeinschaft; participants are primarily from the U.S. and Germany.            
                                                                                             
              The workshop will address postionization techniques in surface                 
              analysis.  The revolution in materials science has made this new               
              field a vital approach for characterizing surfaces, thin films and             
              solids.  These methods have applications in such diverse fields as             
              microelectronics, superconductivity, environmental assessment,                 
              geology, and biomedical materials characterization.  The techniques            
              generally involve the use of a high energy probe such as a laser,              
              electron or ion beam to desorb a portion of the sample into the gas            
              phase.  Now, new techniques to ionize these species are promising to           
              yield improved sensitivity limits and novel approaches for composi-            
              tional studies.  These techniques include electron impact, plasma and          
              glow discharge sources, and single and multiphoton excitation using            
              lasers.  The proposed workshop will bring together experts in these            
              areas to assess the status and future development of postionization            
              methodologies.  Issues such as depth profiling, quantitation and               
              imaging will receive special attention.
