Abstract    :
              After mating, female salamanders of many species can store                     
              spermatozoa for long periods of time before fertilizing their eggs.            
              The spermatozoa are stored in glands in the cloaca called                      
              spermathecae.  Little is known about the cytology of the processes             
              by which spermatozoa remain viable at ambient temperatures in these            
              glands.  In this research, the PI proposes to use transmission                 
              electron microscopy to study sperm storage in three species of                 
              salamanders.  Students from Saint Mary's College, an undergraduate             
              women's college, will be research assistants.  Female Ambystoma                
              tigrinum fertilize eggs soon after mating, so sperm storage is                 
              brief.  Female Eurycea cirrigera may store sperm for 6 months, but             
              not between breeding seasons.  Female Notophthalmus viridescens may            
              store sperm from one breeding season to the next (10 months).                  
              Topics to be addressed include:  whether the spemathecae secrete               
              a substance during mating that attracts sperm to the glands; how               
              the sperms are nourished during storage in the spermathecae;                   
              whether the spermathecae secrete a substance that activates                    
              spermatozoa prior to fertilization; and the fate of spermatozoa                
              left in the spermathecae after fertilization of an egg clutch.                 
              Knowledge of sperm storage mechanisms in salamanders may be useful             
              in studies of fertility in other vertebrates, including man.
