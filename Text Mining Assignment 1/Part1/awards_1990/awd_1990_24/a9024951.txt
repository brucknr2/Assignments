Abstract    :
                   This proposed program of ground-based optical analyses and                
              modeling of upper atmospheric regions addresses important CEDAR                
              objectives.  The areas of investigation are: 1) upper atmosphere               
              dynamics and coupling to the F-region plasma;  2) 630 nm airglow               
              depletions and ionospheric plumes; 3) mesosphere and lower                     
              thermosphere dynamics; 4) geocoronal hydrogen dynamics; and 5)                 
              enhanced-sensitivity Fabry-Perot interferometer (FPI)                          
              development.  The Arequipa, peru FPI will be used in simultaneous              
              measurements with the Jicamarca incoherent scatter radar (ISR)                 
              for detailed determinations of the height variation of the                     
              equatorial thermosphere - F-region plasma coupling.  The 1983-                 
              1990 FPI data base will be analyzed to find the response of the                
              upper thermosphere wind and temperatures to changes in solar flux              
              (sa index) and geomagnetic activity (Kp, Ap, AE indicies).  A                  
              mapping photometer will determine the morphology of 630 nm                     
              airglow depletions and their association with ionospheric plumes               
              (measured by the Jicamarca ISR).  AT Laurel Ridge, PA, the 150                 
              and 100 nm aperture FPI's (improved by CCD detectors) will                     
              determine, respectively, geocoronal hydrogen dynamics (trapped                 
              thermal, ballistic and escape components cia the Ha line) and                  
              mesopause-lower thermosphere dynamics (via OH and 557.7 nm                     
              lines).  At Millstone Hill, MA, under the direction of D. P.                   
              Sipler, the coordinator FPI and ISR studies of midlatitude                     
              thermosphere -ionosphere momentum and energy coupling will                     
              continue.
