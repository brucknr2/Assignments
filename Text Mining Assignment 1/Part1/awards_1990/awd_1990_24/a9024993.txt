Abstract    :
              With this grant in the Computational and Theoretical Chemistry                 
              Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Skodje will study                 
              the classical nonlinear dynamics of bi-molecular and                           
              uni-molecular reactions. The work is at a fundamental level                    
              with its goal being  to understand basic dynamical effects of                  
              importance in predicting the rates of chemical reactions.                      
                                                                                             
              The role of classical phase space structure will be emphasized                 
              and the nature of reactive transport in phase space will be                    
              investigated using a new theory for complex decay rates, which                 
              is based on recent advances in the theory of strange attractors                
              and repellers, and gives a systematically improvable method to                 
              calculate rates. The theory will be especially useful in the                   
              study of transient species which have extremely short life                     
              times, roughly comparable to the intra-molecular relaxation                    
              times. A quantum phase space hydrodynamic model will be applied                
              to the problem of multi-dimensional reactive tunneling. The                    
              multi-dimensional tunneling path will be found directly by                     
              following the fluid orbits. Also, the notion will be explored                  
              that quantum chaos can be regarded as turbulence in the quantum                
              fluid dynamics. Finally, the role of localization in                           
              intra-molecular vibrational redistribution and in reaction                     
              dynamics will be explored by means of quantum maps. Quantum                    
              maps for reactive problems will be used to determine whether                   
              localization will suppress (or sometimes promote) chemical                     
              reaction.
