Abstract    :
              The Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research (SCOR) will conduct a broad       
              range of activities in support of U.S. and NSF-sponsored global                
              geosciences programs.  SCOR will convene meetings of Working Groups to         
              address: wave modelling; sea level and coastal erosion;                        
              chemical/biological ocean sensor technology; sea ice ecology; ocean-           
              atmosphere paleochemistry; and/or pelagic biogeography.  The results of        
              these meetings will be published or otherwise widely distributed.  SCOR        
              will support development of a detailed plan for implementation of the          
              Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS) and detailed international               
              scientific planning for Global Ecosystem Dynamics (GLOBEC).  The latter        
              will be accomplished primarily through a scientific workshop sponsored         
              and organized by SCOR with support from the Intergovernmental                  
              Oceanographic Commission (IOC) of Unesco.
