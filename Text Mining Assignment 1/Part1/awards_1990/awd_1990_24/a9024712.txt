Abstract    :
                   The diffusion of impurities in semiconductors must be modeled             
              accurately to achieve the shallow junctions and high densities                 
              required for very large scale integration.  A five -species kinetic            
              model has been proposed to explain the observed nonlinearities in              
              dopant profiles without ad hoc assumptions and a research code                 
              written to implement the model in three dimensions.  Much work                 
              remains to analyze the resulting reaction-diffusion PDE system                 
              mathematically and to develop computationally  efficient algorithms            
              to solve equations numerically.  Specific tasks include                        
              investigating existence, uniqueness, and stability for solutions to            
              the five species reaction-diffusion system; comparing various                  
              integration techniques with the backward difference formula                    
              currently used; comparing several matrix-free iterative techniques             
              such as GMRES and BCGS with the incomplete orthogonalization                   
              method; finding a  suitable preconditioner that is natural;                    
              developing an efficient adaptive grid refinement strategy;                     
              addressing theoretical questions of convergence and stability for              
              the discrete method; and finally, parallelizing the algorithm.                 
                   This project has been motivated by the need of developing                 
              smaller semiconductors for very large scale integration.  Progress             
              in this project has direct consequence in computer hardware design.
