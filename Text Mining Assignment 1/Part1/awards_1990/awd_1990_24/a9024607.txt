Abstract    :
              A fixed ended beam is subjected to a short pulse of transverse                 
              loading such that plastic deformations are imposed.  Because of the            
              end fixity, dynamic instabilities related to shallow arch action               
              may occur.  Anomalous phenomena (such a final deflections in the               
              direction opposite that of the pulse and severe difficulty of                  
              prediction) have been studied in uniform beams (by finite element              
              analysis) and in two-and single-degree of freedom special beam                 
              models.  In the first two of these cases, indications of                       
              deterministic chaos appear.  Their novelty and interest lie in                 
              their appearance with workless constraints and in the absence of               
              harmonic or other sustained excitation.  Research is proposed here             
              which aims to confirm and amplify the preliminary results already              
              obtained (outlined in the proposal), to gain deeper understanding              
              by further analysis and extensions, and to provide methods for the             
              estimation of parameter ranges in which they are likely to occur.
