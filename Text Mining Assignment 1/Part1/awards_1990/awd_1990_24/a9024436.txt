Abstract    :
              This project comprises the installation, calibration, and                      
              operational preparation of the radome type gust probe system on                
              the two NOAA WP3Ds for the TOGA COARE program.  Fast-response                  
              temperature and humidity sensors will also be included for the                 
              measurement of sensible and latent heat fluxes.  Previous                      
              experience with the installation of the radome system on an NRL                
              P3 indicate that high-quality turbulence data will be obtained.                
              The reduction of the raw data to calibrated time series suitable               
              for analysis by the TOGA COARE investigators is also proposed.                 
                                                                                             
              This research is important because it serves as one of the                     
              studies of TOGA COARE that links convective scale physical                     
              processes to the larger scales that impact climate variability in              
              an especially climate sensitive region of the world, the western               
              Pacific Ocean, the field site of TOGA COARE.
