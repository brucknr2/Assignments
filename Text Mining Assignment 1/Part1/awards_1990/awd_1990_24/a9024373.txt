Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is to conduct experiments and to provide core                     
              measurements of carbon productivity on the US JGOFS cruises to                 
              the equatorial Pacific in 1992. The basic measurement techniques               
              use the radioisotope carbon-14 to assess total carbon                          
              production. Core measurements of new and total production are to               
              be provided to all participants in the EQPAC experiment. The C14               
              measurements will be made using "clean analytical techniques" and              
              incubations will be conducted at both 6 and 24 hours. These core               
              measurements will be made on both the survey and time series                   
              cruises of the JGOFS Equatorial Pacific Experiment. These core                 
              estimates will be used by other /collaborating scientists to                   
              develop global models of carbon flux.
