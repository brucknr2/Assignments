Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program                 
              will help the Department of Chemistry at Western Kentucky                      
              University acquire an Inductively Coupled Plasma-Atomic                        
              Emission Spectrometer (ICP-AES).  The instrument will be used                  
              in research investigations in the following areas:  analysis of                
              trace elements in fuels, analysis of gunshot residues, direct                  
              determination of elements in slurried solids, forensic soil                    
              analysis, analysis of elements in colonizing grasses, analysis                 
              of elements in tree growth rings, and elemental analysis of                    
              animal blood and excrement samples.                                            
                                                                                             
              Atomic emission spectrometry gives the direct elemental                        
              analysis of samples.  Much interest has been directed toward                   
              the atomization of solids into the inductively coupled plasmas                 
              (ICP), by thermal vaporization of the sample followed by                       
              transport into the plasma in an inert carrier gas.  ICP excited                
              atomic emission lines of the elements allow for qualitative                    
              identification of the elements present in the sample.  ICP-AES                 
              is most frequently used for multi element analysis in areas                    
              such as real-time process control, environmental monitoring,                   
              and electronic-grade materials manufacturing.
