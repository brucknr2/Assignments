Abstract    :
                   The Southern Oscillation (SO) and the equatorial quasi-                   
              biennial oscillation (QBO) are related to significant interannual              
              variability in the extratropical winter troposphere and                        
              especially, stratosphere.  This research will examine the                      
              relative roles of the QBO and SO in crating winter-season climate              
              anomalies on interannual timescales.  A "deep" 26-level climate                
              version of the NCAR general circulation model (Community climate               
              Model) will be used to examine the trosphere-stratosphere system               
              with the object of providing a unified view of interannual                     
              wintertime climate variability and its relation to the SO or QBO.              
              The SO and QBO are viewed as interannually varying external                    
              forcing agents for the extratropical winter hemisphere.  Since                 
              winter-season interannual variability is grater in the                         
              stratosphere than the troposphere, the research will concentrate               
              on the stratospheric climate anomalies.  By using a general                    
              circulation model, it is intended to isolate mechanisms capable                
              of communicating the tropical forcing anomalies, SO or QBO, to                 
              the extratropical winter atmosphere, and two such mechanisms are               
              proposed.  Separate winter season integrations under opposite                  
              extremes of the SO or QBO will be performed to determine the                   
              atmospheric responses to the SO and QBO.  Such information is                  
              especially important in the stratosphere where it has not been                 
              possible to distinguish clearly between the effects of the SO and              
              the QBO in the observational climate record.
