Abstract    :
              This project is part of a collaborative effort to obtain long-                 
              term (2 years) observations of ocean circulation and atmospheric               
              forcing, in anticipation of an intensive experiment planned for                
              the Western Pacific Warm Pool in late 1992/early 1993, called                  
              TOGA-COARE (Coupled Ocean Atmosphere Response Experiment).  Long-              
              term measurements will begin in late 1991, and continue until well             
              after the intensive experiment is completed, providing the overall             
              environmental context for the intensive experiment.  In this                   
              component, the P.I.'s will test the feasibility of attaching                   
              conductivity (salinity) sensors to drifting buoys, in order to                 
              obtain better descriptions of the upper ocean density.                         
              Conductivity fluctuations are a major source of variability in the             
              density structure, and hence greatly affect the ocean response to              
              atmospheric forcing in the Western Pacific Region.
