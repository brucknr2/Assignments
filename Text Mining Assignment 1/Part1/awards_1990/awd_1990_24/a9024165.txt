Abstract    :
              The principal thrust of the research addresses the issue of what               
              chemical and structural requirements are needed to optimize coating            
              durability, bond strength, and surface activity.  The ultimate goal            
              is to provide improved materials for biomedical applications.  The             
              ion beam sputter process will provide biocompatible coatings with              
              significantly improved properties, i.e., bond strength, fatigue                
              properties, as compared to currently used coating procedures.  This            
              detailed study of material properties will provide the necessary               
              knowledge to optimize properties which are critical for the long-              
              term fixation of medical devices.
