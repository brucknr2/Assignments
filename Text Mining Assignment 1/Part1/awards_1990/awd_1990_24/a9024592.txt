Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This one-year award will support collaborative research in                     
              mysticete whale systematics and conservation between Richard                   
              Lambertsen of the University of Pennsylvania's Ecosystems, Inc.,               
              Ulfur Arnason of the University of Lund in Sweden. Stephen                     
              Palumbi of the University of Hawaii will also participate in the               
              project.  Lambertsen and Arnason will photoidentify and sample by              
              biopsy free-ranging humpback whales in the offshore waters                     
              between Iceland and Greenland.  The tissues will be analyzed for               
              mitrochondrial DNA variation and sequencing at the University of               
              Hawaii and the University of Lund.  These data will be correlated              
              and compared to corresponding estimates of mitochondrial DNA                   
              nucleotides of other whale species in the Atlantic and Pacific.                
                                                                                             
              The project will extend ongoing investigations into the worldwide              
              population genetics and evolution of mysticete whales supported                
              under NSF grant BSR-900006 with Stephen Palumbi and Richard                    
              Lambertsen as consultant.  This project is part of the NSF's                   
              Conservation Biology Initiative.  Results will allow an initial                
              assessment of the genetic consequences of commercially exploited               
              whales, provide a greater understanding of mitochondrial DNA                   
              variation among whales worldwide and ultimately help promote the               
              whale conservation. The project will benefit from the                          
              complementary expertise of Lambertsen in skin biopsy sampling                  
              and Arnason in DNA analysis and marine mammals.
