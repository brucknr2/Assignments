Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research of Professor C. Rodger to                
              work in combinatorics.  He will work on the embedding of partial               
              latin squares of order n into latin squares of order less than or              
              equal to 2n.  He also intends to work on problems involving                    
              embedding triple systems and graph decompositions.                             
                   The research crosses lines between the areas of combinatorics             
              and statistics.  Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods              
              to study how discrete collections of objects can be organized.  And            
              so it is extremely important to modern communications, for example             
              the design of large networks as in telephone systems.  The main                
              object to be studied in the proposed research, latin squares, is               
              a fundamental tool used in designing experiments and so in                     
              improving quality control in many areas of production within the               
              economy.
