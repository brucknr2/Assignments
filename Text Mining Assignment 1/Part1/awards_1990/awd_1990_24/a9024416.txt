Abstract    :
              Rotational magnetization-vector experiments will be conducted with             
              yttrium-barium-copper-oxide and other type-II superconductors of               
              current interest.  These measurements allow the total vector                   
              magnetization of a sample exposed to a field to be uniquely                    
              decomposed into a diamagnetic (shielding) component and a                      
              penetrating (vortex) flux component. The latter component in high-             
              temperature superconductors has extraordinary rotational properties            
              that reflect and characterize the strength distribution of the                 
              vortex pinning forces which, in turn, control the critical current.            
              The technique will sample the anisotropous of the pinning forces as            
              well their energy distribution.  The research will employ,                     
              polycrystalline, grain-oriented and single-crystal materials.
