Abstract    :
              Angiosperm leaf megafossils from the southern Rocky Mountains will             
              be surveyed to determine patterns of generic and familial diversity            
              in floral assemblages bracketing the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary              
              (66 million years b.p.), one of the five major extinction episodes             
              in the history of life.  Although species-level analyses of pollen             
              and leaf assemblages have elucidated many details of climatic and              
              ecological change at this time, many biological properties of plant            
              extinction cannot be determined accurately, because leaf                       
              megafossils must be determined through detailed analysis of foliar             
              venation and cuticular anatomy in well-preserved remains and                   
              extensive comparisons with reference collections of extant                     
              angiosperm leaves.  This analysis will provide more reliable                   
              determinations of systematic relationships than are currently                  
              available for latest Cretaceous and earliest Tertiary paleofloras,             
              in assemblages that have tight stratigraphic age control.  These               
              systematic determinations will provide a data base for future                  
              quantitative analysis of end-Cretaceous plant extinction, which                
              will be important for testing hypotheses on the nature of biotic               
              extinction.
