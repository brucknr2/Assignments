Abstract    :
                   The principal investigators plan to develop three courses                 
              during the period of the award.  The courses are designed to                   
              interest students in aspects of Scientific Computation through                 
              computer algebra, numerical bifurcation, and partial differential              
              equations.  The students holding fellowships will have various                 
              educational tasks, such as writing up clear lecture notes and                  
              assignment solutions, software testing, maintenance and                        
              consultation.  They will also run a weekly tutorial for lectures               
              and demonstrations concerning the use of software for                          
              applications in the courses.  The three courses will be loosely                
              coordinated through a weekly seminar, in which the principal                   
              investigators, and later the students, will give presentations on              
              topics of common interest, and will lead discussion.                           
                   The award recommendation is for a one-time contribution to                
              equipment and student support for this laudable activity,                      
              consistent with the gold of High Performance Computing and                     
              Communications.
