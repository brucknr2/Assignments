Abstract    :
              This research deals with NMR investigations of molecular motions               
              and relaxation processes in solids.  Some of the work (broken                  
              symmetry phases of solid hydrogen) involves high-pressure anvil NMR            
              methods.  Elucidation  of mechanisms of anomalous relaxaton of                 
              hydrogen in metal hydrides is also a goal of the work.  Finally, a             
              continuing project deals with stochastic and deterministic aspects             
              of the freezing of cyanide ions in lattices where the molecules are            
              free to rotate at high temperatures but are rigid at low                       
              temperatures.
