Abstract    :
              This award will support collaboration between the University                   
              of Utah Department of Chemistry (David Grant and Anita                         
              Orendt) and the Utah Supercomputing Institute (Julio Facelli),                 
              and the University of Buenos Aires Department of Organic                       
              Chemistry (Alicia Pomilio) and Department of Physics (Ruben                    
              Contreras).  The aim of the project is to better understand                    
              the electronic structure of flavonoids and related compounds,                  
              using 17O NMR and quantum mechanical methods.                                  
                                                                                             
              Flavonoids are natural products of plants native to Argentina,                 
              known for their therapeutic effects.  It is expected that                      
              research results from this project will lead to a rational                     
              understanding of the relevant structure-activity relationships                 
              of flavonoids and potentially to the discovery of new drugs.                   
              The isolation and synthesis of flavonoids and the confor-                      
              mational analysis and NMR parameters of these compounds will                   
              be done in Buenos Aires.  The 0-17 NMR chemical shielding                      
              measurements and ab initio calculations of chemical shielding                  
              as a function of conformation will be done in Utah.  The                       
              synthesis of 0-17 labeled flavonoids in Buenos Aires will make                 
              the solid state 0-17 NMR studies feasible.
