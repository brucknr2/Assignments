Abstract    :
              A large body of work in biophysics and physical chemistry                      
              suggests that the equilibrium, kinetics, and transport of                      
              proteins at surfaces may deviate substantially from these                      
              processes in bulk solution, i.e., that unique phenomena may occur              
              and be important in the physical aspects of biological chemistry               
              at interfaces.  Dr. Thompson plans to address these questions by               
              using substrate-supported planar model membranes and recently                  
              developed techniques in time-resolved, laser-based fluorescence                
              microscopy.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              This proposal fulfills the FAW objectives which are 1) to                      
              recognize outstanding and promising women scientists and                       
              engineers in academic careers of research and teaching and 2) to               
              facilitate the further development of their careers.
