Abstract    :
              Travel funds are provided to enable a well-known speaker from                  
              overseas to present a keynote address on the role of surface                   
              mechanics in tribology at special sessions held at the Winter                  
              Annual Meeting of the ASME in Dallas, TX.  The special                         
              sessions are entitled "Intersection of Tribology and                           
              Fracture" and are intended to expose researchers in mechanics                  
              to the relevant specific research needs in tribology.  The                     
              keynote talk is entitled "Predicting Wear for Metal Surfaces                   
              in Sliding Contact Using a Low Cycle Fatigue Model of Wear                     
              Particle Generation" and is authored by professor Peter Oxley                  
              of the University of New South Wales in Australia.
