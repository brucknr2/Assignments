Abstract    :
              We propose to study the design, fabrication, and                               
              characterization of the 8-12 u long wavelength infrared                        
              (LWIR) sensing element of image sensor cell, which is                          
              composed of one GaAs/AlGaAs multiple quantum well (MQW)                        
              photoconductor and three modulation doped field effect                         
              transistor (MODFET) switches, controlling the cell's                           
              charging, output, and reset, respectively.  The critical                       
              issue is how to make the mesa structures of the MOW                            
              photoconductor and the planar structures of the MODFET                         
              compatible.  BAsed on our new invention of the                                 
              integration of MQW photocondutor and FET structures,                           
              the patent of which is being applied, the design and                           
              fabrication procedure of a monolithically integrated                           
              image sensor cell is proposed.  The success of the                             
              project is crucial for the development of the                                  
              monolithically integrated GaAs/AlGaAs multiple quantum                         
              well imager, which is a two dimensional focal plane                            
              array of sensor cells combined with the signal readout                         
              circuits.  The development of the monolithic long                              
              wavelength IR multiple quantum well image sensor                               
              represents an important goal, not only in the thermal                          
              imaging technology, but also int he innovative                                 
              application of superlattices.
