Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Populations of grouse in the genus Tympanuchus are on the                      
              decline, and little information exists regarding the systematics               
              or population genetics of taxa within this genus.  This research               
              will utilize restriction endonuclease analysis in combination                  
              with enzymatic DNA amplification (polymerase chain reaction, PCR)              
              and nucleotide sequencing of selected portions of the                          
              mitochondrial DNA molecule.  Both extant and extinct populations               
              will be integrated in a detailed assessment of systematic                      
              relationships and patterns of geographic variation within and                  
              among prairies grouse species.  Genetically-unique populations                 
              will be identified and the extent of divergence among them                     
              estimated.  The effects of historical factors and recent human                 
              influence on the origin and current distribution of prairie                    
              grouse populations will also be evaluated.  These data will                    
              provide valuable information regarding the evolutionary history                
              of prairie grouse in North America as well as the integration of               
              molecular genetic techniques in solving problems of conservation               
              biology and wildlife management.
