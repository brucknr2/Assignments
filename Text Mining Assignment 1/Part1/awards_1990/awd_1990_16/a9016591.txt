Abstract    :
              This is a joint award with Dr. Joshi at the University of                      
              Pennsylvania.  This team has proposed several major research                   
              tasks in natural language processing with special emphasis on                  
              several mathematical and computational aspects.  The work clearly              
              has a formal and mathematical character.  The various                          
              computational structures and strategies the team has developed                 
              and will develop, need to be investigated mathematically                       
              becausesuch investigations shed light on the descriptive and                   
              processing powers of these formalisms.  These two aspects, i.e.,               
              the  development of the structures and strategies, and their                   
              mathematical investigations, are very much interrelated.  It is                
              believed that natural language processing backed up by a formal                
              framework, and mathematical investigations grounded in empirical               
              studies are two very productive areas of research.  The                        
              researcher will focus on interested in mathematical                            
              investigations only to the extent to which the results have                    
              important implications for natural language processing.
