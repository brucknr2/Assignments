Abstract    :
              This award will support the participation of eight U.S.                        
              scientists in a joint seminar on "Fundamentals of Bath                         
              Smelting and Clean Steel Production," to be held in North                      
              Myrtle Beach, South Carolina in October 1991.  The meeting                     
              will focus on fundamental research on methods of developing                    
              new ironmaking technologies that use coal directly and                         
              processes to prodice high quality "clean" steels.  The                         
              co-organizers are Professor Richard J. Fruehan and Alan W.                     
              Cramb, Department of Metallurgical Engineering and Materials                   
              Science, Carnegie Mellon University and Professor Nobuo Sano,                  
              Department of Metallurgy, University of Tokyo.  This is the                    
              third joint seminar in the general area of steelmaking, with                   
              the others being held in 1976 and 1983.                                        
                                                                                             
              Technically advanced countries, such as the United States and                  
              Japan, must develop new iron and steelmaking processes that                    
              are economical, pose fewer environmental problems, and produce                 
              high quality steels for national and international markets.                    
              Both countries are developing such processes to produce high                   
              quality or ultra clean steel.  Such steels are required for                    
              new steel products and improved current products, such as                      
              those for automotive applications.  It is in higher quality                    
              steels that the United States and Japan have some advantage                    
              over lower cost producing nations and must maintain their                      
              advantage.  In the process of bath smelting there are many                     
              fundamental generic problems.  Whereas much of the practical                   
              know how for the process is confidential in nature, the                        
              generic fundamental research is not.  Examples of fundamental                  
              research include slag foaming, reduction reactions, and                        
              solution of ore and coal.  The joint seminar will provide a                    
              unique forum for discussing this research which will, in the                   
              long term, benefit each country's efforts to develop a new                     
              process.
