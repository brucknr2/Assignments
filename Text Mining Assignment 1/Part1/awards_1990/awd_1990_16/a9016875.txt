Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is supported under NSF Announcement No. 90-23,                    
              "Repair and Rehabilitation Research for Seismic Resistance of                  
              Structures."                                                                   
                                                                                             
              The object of the research is to determine how masonry infill                  
              panels resist story shears during earthquakes.  The focus of                   
              the investigation is on the tolerable amount of lateral drift                  
              that existing infills can resist within their plane before                     
              significant damage occurs.  In addition, the stability of                      
              damaged infills is to be examined by loading cracked panels                    
              normal to their plane.  Repair measures will be developed that                 
              will enhance transverse flexural strength.                                     
                                                                                             
              A series of full-scale specimens are to be constructed and                     
              tested.  Each test structure will be a one-story masonry                       
              infill panel surrounded by a one-bay reinforced concrete                       
              frame.  Horizontal forces will be applied at static rates, but                 
              will be cycled in a representative sequence of small and large                 
              amplitudes.  Variables of the test series will include the                     
              type of masonry unit (clay brick or concrete block), the type                  
              of mortar, the strength and stiffness of the frame and the                     
              type of infill repair method.                                                  
                                                                                             
              This project is part of a collaborative research effort which                  
              combines fundamental studies by an academic institution and                    
              a professional engineering firm.  Together they represent a                    
              common effort for the implementation of research results.
