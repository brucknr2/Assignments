Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award provides support for the participation of ten US                    
              scientists in a joint US-Japan seminar on "Basic Mechanisms                    
              of Helium Heat Transfer and Related Influence on Stability of                  
              Superconducting Magnets."  The interactions between helium                     
              heat transfer and superconducting magnets are of great                         
              importance and interest right now.  In spite of the progress                   
              that is being made with high temperature superconductors,                      
              liquid or supercritical helium cooled superconductors will                     
              still be used in large-scale projects such as the Super-                       
              conducting Super Collider (SSC) for some time to come. By                      
              bringing together scientists from different magnet stabilty                    
              and heat transfer projects in the US and Japan, this seminar                   
              should enable  participants to make considerable contributions                 
              to both subjects.                                                              
                                                                                             
              The seminar will be held August 26-30, 1991 in Los Angeles,                    
              CA.  The co-organizers are Professor T H K  Frederking,                        
              Department of Chemical Engineering, University of California,                  
              Los Angeles and Professor Takehiro Ito, Kyushu University,                     
              Japan.  Specific topics to be discussed at the seminar                         
              include (1) basic mechanisms of helium heat transfer;  (2)                     
              stability criteria of superconductors and procedures to                        
              analyze conductor-coolant coupled transient phenomena; and                     
              (3) priorities in various areas of cooling technology.  This                   
              is the second seminar on this subject, the first being held                    
              in 1988.  There have been considerable developments in this                    
              area since the first joint seminar held in Fukuoka, Japan in                   
              1988 and this seminar should build upon  and extend the                        
              scientific cooperation established at that time.
