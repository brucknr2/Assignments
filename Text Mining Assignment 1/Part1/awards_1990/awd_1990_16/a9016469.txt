Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Melanins are a class of cellular pigments found in the tissues of              
              organisms.  Neuromelanin, a product of catecholamines metabolism,              
              is a pigment found in the central nervous system of some mammals,              
              including man.  The catecholamines involved in the production of               
              neuromelanin are two neurotransmitters, dopamine and                           
              norepinephrine.  The function of neuromelanin is unknown but                   
              there is indirect evidence that it may be important in                         
              determining the behavior of aminergic neurons, particularly those              
              neurons involved in the genesis of Parkinsonism.  The goal of                  
              this project is to determine the role of neuromelanin by studying              
              the pigment in vivo, using the scanning tunnelling electron                    
              microscopy and magnetic resonance imaging techniques.  With these              
              techniques it should be possible to monitor changes in the                     
              paramagnetic and semiconductor properties of the pigment and                   
              relate them to different functional states of the neurons.  This               
              investigation will increase the understanding of this                          
              neurochemical which may be involved with the cause and treatment               
              of Parkinson's disease and neuropsychiatric disorders.
