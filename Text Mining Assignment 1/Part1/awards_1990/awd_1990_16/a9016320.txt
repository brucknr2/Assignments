Abstract    :
              This is a proposal to fund a MiniSymposium on                                  
              "Biosensors:  Past Achievements, Present Progress and                          
              Future Challenges".  The MiniSymposium will be part of                         
              the November 1-4, 1990, Philadelphia meeting of the                            
              IEEE/EMBS.  This meeting is the largest single yearly                          
              conference in biomedical engineering.  The request is for                      
              travel and subsistence expenses for seven prominent                            
              speakers.
