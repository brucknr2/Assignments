Abstract    :
              The project uses the nonlinear programming formulation to define               
              a generalized reliability index as the difference between external             
              work and internal strain energy.  The nonlinear strain energy                  
              formulations are investigated in order to introduce both linear and            
              nonlinear material behavior.  Expanded constraint sets are                     
              developed to be consistent with the more generalized mechanisms of             
              failure associated with the nonlinear optimization objective.  An              
              alternative approach based on the static formulation is also                   
              followed, obviating the need for modal definitions.  Finally, the              
              combination of failure probabilities into system reliability is                
              pursued in terms of the union of failure events in a stepwise                  
              search.
