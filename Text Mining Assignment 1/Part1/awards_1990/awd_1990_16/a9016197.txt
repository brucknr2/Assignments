Abstract    :
              Funds are requested for the purchase of a SLM Aminco DW-2000 dual              
              wavelength dual beam scanning spectrophotometer.  This instrument              
              will be housed in the Biochemistry Department as part of the                   
              Biopolymer Service Center where it would be accessible to all                  
              researchers on campus.
