Abstract    :
                   This is an interdisciplinary, site-specific modeling study                
              focused on the Georges Bank conducted within the GLOBEC -Global                
              Ocean Ecocsystems Dyanamics framework of the U.S. Global Change                
              Research Program.  It involves a collaborative effort on the part              
              of U.S. and Canadian scientists at the Department of Fisheries                 
              and Oceans.  Biological and physical data will be examined with                
              the aid of three-dimensional circulation models under development              
              at Dartmouth College and Skidaway Institute of Oceanography.                   
                   The study will focus on sea scallops (Placopectin                         
              magellanicus), Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and the copepod                     
              Calanus finmarchicus.  Larval drift models driven by the                       
              circulation models will be created and used to determine the                   
              extent to which egg and larval distributions on Georges Bank can               
              be explained by the monthly-mean circulation fields; and to                    
              evaluate the significance of simple behaviors (vertical                        
              migration) and more complex physics (time-dependence, spatial                  
              structures) to the egg and larval distributions.                               
                   The general approach will be to focus on the null hypothesis              
              that distributions are determined by passive advection and                     
              diffusion in the monthly-mean circulation fields, and the                      
              corollary that apparent "retention" is merely a reflection of the              
              Bank's natural residence time.  Hypotheses for significant                     
              influences from higher-frequency flow variability, small-scale                 
              flow structures and vertical migration will also be explored.
