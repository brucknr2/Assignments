Abstract    :
              The group of investigators listed in this proposal have                        
              developed, over the years, many techniques for examining various               
              aspects of membrane structure and function.  Steady state                      
              fluorescence measurements are a fundamental measurement which is               
              ideally suited to membranous systems and this application will                 
              describe several diverse techniques which have been, and will be,              
              used to investigate a series of membrane problems from the most                
              fundamental lipid-lipid interaction to the most complex of cell                
              signalling processes.  These projects include:  the formation of               
              compositional lipid domains in multilipid systems, the                         
              conformation of membrane-bound proteins, the mechanism of                      
              protein-lipid interactions, the role of lipid physical properties              
              in the functioning of an integral membrane protein and the                     
              mechanism of intracellular signalling.  In many of the projects                
              involving membrane proteins, advantage will be taken of                        
              site-specific mutagenesis to produce modified proteins with more               
              favorable fluorescent properties.
