Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Water-saturated sandy soils are susceptible                                    
              to liquefaction when subjected to strong                                       
              ground shaking, such as occurs during an                                       
              earthquake.  Liquefied soils experience a                                      
              decrease in bearing strength: this can lead                                    
              to the partial or total collapse of buildings                                  
              standing on liquefied soils.                                                   
                                                                                             
              The aim of this project is to verify the                                       
              analyses used to predict liquefaction due to                                   
              earthquake loading.  Since the field data                                      
              needed for this verification is extremely                                      
              difficult to obtain, data is being used                                        
              instead from laboratory experiments performed                                  
              on geotechnical centrifuges.  This is a                                        
              relatively new technique for soil testing                                      
              which is becoming well accepted in the                                         
              geotechnical research community.  The                                          
              technique for simulating earthquakes on                                        
              centrifuges is being developed, and the                                        
              results obtained have generated confidence in                                  
              the method: questions that remain to be                                        
              answered are being addressed in this study.                                    
                                                                                             
              Different geotechnical structures, including                                   
              sloping ground, dams, coastal dikes, and                                       
              embankments are being investigated so as to                                    
              validate the applicability of the                                              
              liquefaction analysis methods to a variety of                                  
              geotechnical structures.  Class A predictions                                  
              - which involve predicting the soil response                                   
              without knowing the measured results - are                                     
              used for later comparison with measured                                        
              results.

              improving the understanding of the soil                                        
              liquefaction phenomenon, and to the                                            
              reliability of methods used to predict the                                     
              occurrence of liquefaction and the resulting                                   
              damage to structures.  This action is for
