Abstract    :
              This award will support Professor Rodolfo Rosales of MIT in a                  
              research collaboration with Professor Pablo M. Jacovkis of                     
              the University of Buenos Aires, Argentina.  The researchers                    
              intend to carry out research in the stability theory of                        
              square wave detonations.                                                       
                                                                                             
              The problem of propagation of reacting shocks in a gaseous                     
              combustible media (detonation waves) has interested researchers                
              since the end of the last century.  The first models for such                  
              propagation were proposed at the beginning of the century but                  
              it was soon realized that they were too simple and did not                     
              take into account the very rich structure of detonation                        
              waves.  Since the early 1950's researchers have attempted to                   
              understand the theory by investigating the stability of                        
              plane detonations.  In particular, the Square Wave Model                       
              allows for a linearized stability analysis that is relatively                  
              simple but leads to contradictory results and "catastrophic                    
              instabilities".  The researchers intend, through a combination                 
              of numerical and analytical studies, to investigate the                        
              reasons for such badly believed stability for this model.                      
              The project will combine the experience of Prof. Rosales in                    
              analytical techniques with the computational background of                     
              Prof. Jacovkis.
