Abstract    :
              Mathematical objects of the same category often come in two                    
              varieties: regular ones, which are easy to describe or classify,               
              or have some "nice" properties; and the irregular, more elusive                
              ones.  A good example are homomorphisms on C(?0, 1!) into some                 
              Banach algebra:  one would think of the continuous ones as                     
              regular, the discontinuous ones as irregular.  It happens (as in               
              the above example) that the existence of irregular objects in a                
              given category can neither be proved nor disproved, at least                   
              with the help of only universally accepted mathematical tools (as              
              formalized in axiomatic set theory).                                           
                   The research of this project focuses on three methods to                  
              extend the toolkit of mathematics in a way that allows                         
              elimination of certain irregular objects:                                      
                   -    the Axiom of Determinacy, which says that there are no               
                        irregular (i.e., undetermined) games of sorts,                       
                   -    the Open Coloring Axiom, which says that certain                     
                        irregular partitions do not exist,                                   
                   -    assumptions that mathematics takes place in certain                  
                        "harmless forcing extensions" of the constructible                   
                        universe.                                                            
              The relative strength of these methods is to be determined and                 
              possible improvements and new applications of them sought.
