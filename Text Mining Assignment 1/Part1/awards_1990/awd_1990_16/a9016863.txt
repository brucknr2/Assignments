Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is supported under NSF Announcement No. 90-23,                    
              "Repair and Rehabilitation Research for Seismic Resistance of                  
              Structures."                                                                   
                                                                                             
              The two primary goals of this research project are the                         
              evaluation of:    1) the lateral strength and drift                            
              capabilities of older reinforced concrete slab-column frame                    
              buildings and 2) the use of ductile steel bracing for seismic                  
              upgrading of such structures.                                                  
                                                                                             
              This research is intended to contribute to a methodology for                   
              evaluating the lateral strength and deformation capacity of                    
              older slab-column concrete frame structures which are located                  
              in regions of potentially high seismic activity, but were not                  
              designed and detailed for significant lateral strength and                     
              ductility.  This will be achieved by conducting laboratory                     
              tests of a 2 bay by 1 bay 2-story reinforced concrete slab-                    
              column frame specimen.  Design criteria will be developed for                  
              strengthening such structures with ductile steel bracing                       
              members.  These tests should make a significant contribution                   
              to the small amount of information now available on the                        
              lateral load behavior of concrete frame structures                             
              strengthened with steel bracing members.
