Abstract    :
                   During the past several years the PI has developed, refined,              
              and applied a technique for determining meridional winds in the                
              upper atmosphere from the height of the ionospheric F2 peak                    
              electron density hmax.  Recent studies have generally verified                 
              the approach and continued funding will move the program into the              
              application and validation phase.  Interesting results arising                 
              out of recent work  will be pursued.  The derivation of                        
              meridional winds from hmF2 is being established as a technique                 
              that complements the incoherent scatter radar and Fabry-Perot                  
              techniques.  It currently provides the only way to determine                   
              neutral winds in the thermosphere on a nearly global basis.  This              
              method shows promise of producing results comparable in accuracy               
              to other techniques, and has the advantage that measurements of                
              hmF2 are made routinely and systematically on a global scale.                  
              Additional work will concentrate on several interesting aspects                
              of the neutral wind such as storm-time behavior and seasonal,                  
              solar cyclical and tidal effects.  ***
