Abstract    :
              Operation of mechanical systems at higher temperatures leads to                
              greater efficiency, but proper design requires the understanding               
              of the behavior of the individual components.  This, in turn,                  
              requires a suitable model of the material response and a means of              
              computing the stresses and strains at critical points.  Detailed               
              predictive capabilities are just becoming available and must be                
              evaluated.  The objective of this research is to measure biaxial               
              strains at stress concentrations in metal specimens tested at high             
              temperature (using laser based techniques) (650oC) and compare the             
              results with predictions.
