Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              This work will extend the observations made as part of the                     
              U.S.-JGOFS Bermuda Atlantic Time Series (BATS) Program to                      
              include detailed optical oceanographic measurements.  These                    
              observations are necessary to develop and evaluate optically-                  
              based primary production models.                                               
                                                                                             
              The goals are to:                                                              
                                                                                             
              1)   Characterize the optical properties at the BATS site;                     
                   temporally (seasonally, as well as on diel time scales),                  
                   spatially (as a function of depth) and spectrally (by                     
                   color of light);                                                          
                                                                                             
              2)   Examine the light utilization by the phytoplankton                        
                   community and its temporal variability;                                   
                                                                                             
              3)   Develop and evaluate bio-optical models for determining in                
                   situ irradiance spectra and primary production rates from                 
                   standard incident irradiance and pigment concentration                    
                   measurements; and                                                         
                                                                                             
              4)   Provide the "optical link" by which the BATS observations                 
                   may be used to evaluate bio-optical models for pigment                    
                   concentration, primary production, and sinking particle                   
                   fluxes from future satellite-based ocean color sensors.
