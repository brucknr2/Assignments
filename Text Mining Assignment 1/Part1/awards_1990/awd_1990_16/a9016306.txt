Abstract    :
              This award supports an international workshop on applied                       
              mathematics to be held in Washington, DC from July 8-12,                       
              1991.  The participants are several U.S. applied mathe-                        
              maticians and six primarily from the Andean countries of                       
              South America.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              This is a rare opportunity for interaction in an important                     
              area for both U.S. and Latin American scientists.  There is                    
              substantial potential for promoting long-term cooperation                      
              that will benefit both groups.  This fulfills very well the                    
              goals of the Science in Developing Countries Program.
