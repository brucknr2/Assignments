Abstract    :
              This research focuses on pre-choice stages of decision making,                 
              especially  on the generation of alternatives.  Unfortunately there            
              are few theories with non-choice aspects of decision making.  While            
              there is some empirical work, it tends to be quite fragment                    
              to the lack of a general conceptual framework.  Much of the                    
              attention devoted to these topics has been focused on promoting                
              techniques for improving one's creativity, however, such techniques            
              are rarely tested.  While the investigators do not have a unifying             
              theory, they do have  the structure provided by an integrative                 
              computer program that includes a variety of alternative generation             
              techniques.  They will extend their development of this computer               
              program which is based on a conceptual approach ranging from highly            
              structured reasoning to very unstructured thinking.  The program               
              serves as a means for exploring the relative effectiveness of                  
              various techniques and their underlying themes.  The  proposed                 
              tests will include multiple types of problems, problem solving                 
              durations of up to 3 months, and subjects who face the challenge               
              of solving problems creatively in their professional lives. As wel             
              as contributing to empirical knowledge, the results may help to                
              advance theory.
