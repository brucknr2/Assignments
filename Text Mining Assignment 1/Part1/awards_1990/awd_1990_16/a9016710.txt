Abstract    :
                   This is a Research Opportunity Award (ROA) to the University              
              of the District of Columbia (UDC), an Historically Black                       
              Institution.                                                                   
                   The University of the District of Columbia, in cooperation                
              with the Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for                   
              Computer Aided Life Cycle Engineering (CALCE) at the University of             
              Maryland will develop an interactive computer program for thermal              
              analysis of Printed Wiring Boards (PWB) cooling.  The UDC will use             
              state-of the-art knowledge to evaluate CALCE software for                      
              convective flow over PWB, test the software, report on capabilities            
              and limitations, develop documentation, and improve the CALCE code.            
                   The Program Director recommends that the University of the                
              District of Columbia be awarded $100,000 for two (2) years under               
              the ROA Program.  $50,000 of this award is cost shared by the                  
              Division of Infrastructure Development in Engineering.
