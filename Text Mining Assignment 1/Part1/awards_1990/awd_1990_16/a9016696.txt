Abstract    :
              The research, in the general area of Analytical and Surface                    
              Chemistry, focuses on the detailed dynamics of heterogeneous                   
              reactions.  The work promises to provide detailed information                  
              about reactions at surfaces that is crucial to a basic                         
              understanding of surface reaction processes.  This sort of                     
              information is important in many applications, such as                         
              heterogeneous catalysis, corrosion and wear, and electronic                    
              device processing.                                                             
                                                                                             
              Oxidation of carbon monoxide by oxygen on platinum, oxidation                  
              of carbon monoxide by nitric oxide on platinum, and the                        
              reduction of nitrogen dioxide by carbon monoxide on gold and                   
              platinum surfaces will be studied.  The chosen systems provide                 
              a progression of reaction energetics and mechanistic                           
              differences. A range of surface science probes will be used,                   
              and the reactions will be studied using a molecular beam                       
              scattering system.  The experiments will be interpreted using                  
              trajectory calculation modeling.
