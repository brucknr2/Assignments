Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a two year collaborative project between Walter                        
              D. Pilkey of the University of Virginia and Jin Dewen of                       
              Qinghua University, Beijing.  It is sponsored by NSF and                       
              the Chinese State Education Commission.                                        
                                                                                             
              In this project the concept of "configurationless"                             
              optimization will be developed and applied to the design                       
              of mechanical systems, with emphasis on rotating shaft                         
              systems.  The work will be based on the concept of the                         
              limiting performance of dynamic systems.  For limiting                         
              performance studies the optimization is conducted on a                         
              model for which generic (time dependent) forces represent                      
              those portions of the system being designed.  Four types                       
              of problems will be studies:  (1) extreme-disturbance                          
              analysis, (2) optimum system performance, (3) optimum                          
              system design, and (4) optimum identification of                               
              disturbances and values of parameters.  The goal of the                        
              project is to improve understanding of the optimal                             
              design of mechanical systems, especially rotor systems.                        
                                                                                             
              Theoretical work will be pursued while Professor Jin is                        
              a visiting scientist in Professor Pilkey's laboratory.                         
              Subsequently, Professor Pilkey will participate in                             
              testing and verification of the theories during his                            
              visit to Profesor Jin's applications laboratory at                             
              Qinghua.
