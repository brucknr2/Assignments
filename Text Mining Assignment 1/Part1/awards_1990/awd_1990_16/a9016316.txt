Abstract    :
              The rare brief periods of total solar eclipse provide valuable                 
              opportunities for ground-based observers to study the inner regions            
              of the solar corona.  Dust particles in the outer regions of the               
              corona (F corona) are believed to be orbiting under the combined               
              influence of solar gravitational and radiative forces which                    
              dominate the region.  Observational confirmation of the expected               
              dust velocities within a few solar radii of the Sun are difficult              
              to obtain.  Total solar eclipses offer opportunities of a few                  
              minutes for observation and experimentation with suitable                      
              instrumentation.                                                               
                                                                                             
              In 1978 a team at Iowa State University began development of a                 
              special electro-optical system to detect and measure the motion of             
              the dust.  The instrument was used in 1979 to record the first                 
              detections of the dust velocity profiles at two points in the                  
              corona.  Two attemps to employ improved versions of the instrument             
              system at subsequent eclipses were not successful.  If the sky                 
              conditions are optimum for the 1991 eclipse, it is hoped that about            
              10 times the data that has been previously collected will be                   
              obtained.  These measurements would provide information on the                 
              motions of the dust in the F corona.
