Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Partial support for travel of domestic and foreign research                    
              scientists with expertise in different aspects of the pyrroles                 
              present in photosynthetic organisms is requested.  Attendance of               
              these scientists at an interdisciplinary meeting dedicated to                  
              reporting the latest research accomplishments in this important                
              area of photosynthesis will lead to enhancement of our                         
              understanding of pyrrole function in the photosynthetic process.               
                                                                                             
              The harvesting of radiant (light) energy and its conversion to                 
              chemical forms in the form of plant and bacterial biomass is the               
              primary and fundamentally important way by which energy for support            
              of life processes on this planet occurs.  Pyrroles are key chemical            
              components of the biological apparatus that brings about this                  
              conversion of radiant energy to that in chemical bonds.  The                   
              formation and function of these important chemicals is the focus               
              of this meeting experts dedicated to such studies.//
