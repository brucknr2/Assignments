Abstract    :
              This award provides support for the participation of eight US                  
              scientists in a joint US-Japan seminar on "Satellite Ocean                     
              Color Remote Sensing."  Synoptic coverage of ocean color data                  
              from satellites has for some time been a high priority for                     
              the ocean sciences community.  Ocean color data is important                   
              both for current and future ocean science investigations and                   
              has particularly important applications to global change                       
              problems.  The first US satellite ocean color scanner (CZCS)                   
              was launched in 1978 and successfully produced data until the                  
              summer of 1986 when a technical problem with the instrument                    
              forced an end to the mission.  However the mission did prove                   
              the feasibility of using a satellite scanning radiometer to                    
              provide accurate estimates of near-surface scanning con-                       
              centrations of phytoplankton chlorophyll over large regions                    
              of the global ocean.  The next US ocean color scanner                          
              (Sea-WiFS) is due to be launched in 1994 and a similar                         
              scanner (OCTS) is scheduled to be launched by the Japanese                     
              in 1996.  This seminar therefore is particularly timely in                     
              that it will provide the opportunity for oceanographers from                   
              each country to discuss and develop a formal structure to                      
              review plans for both Sea-WiFS and OCTS.                                       
                                                                                             
              The seminar is to held on May 6-10, 1991 at the East-West                      
              Center, Honolulu, Hawaii.  The co-organizers are Dr. James A.                  
              Yoder, Graduate School of Oceanography, University of Rhode                    
              Island and Dr. Hajime Fukushima, School of Marine Science and                  
              Technology, Tokai University, Japan.  Specific topics to be                    
              discussed at the seminar include (1) new developments in                       
              satellite ocean color research; (2) the possibilities for                      
              exchanging ocean color data between US and Japanese scientists;                
              and (3) the compilation of specific recommendations to NASA                    
              (US space agency) and NASDA (Japanese space agency) that will                  
              improve and enhance the scientific utility of ocean color                      
              data.  It is hoped that as a result of the seminar                             
              oceanographers from both the US and Japan, and from other                      
              countries, will be able to easily work with the satellite                      
              ocean color data collected from these two sensors, and make                    
              comparisons with the data collected from the earlier mission                   
              in this area.
