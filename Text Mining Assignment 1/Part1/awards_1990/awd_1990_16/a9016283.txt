Abstract    :
              Being the terminus for stellar evolution, white dwarfs are                     
              important in astronomy.  Their existence as remnants of previous               
              generations of stars makes them convenient probes of the formation             
              of massive stars back to the birth of the disk of our Milky Way                
              Galaxy.  In addition, their structure is well defined: if their                
              chemical compositions and masses are specified, their radii become             
              determined.  In this work the Principal Investigator (PI) will                 
              combine his efforts with two collaborators; their joint effort will            
              be a collaborative NSF supported venture. The three PI's will                  
              complete a survey of white dwarfs in widely spaced double stars.               
              The companions of these stars are on the main sequence, and their              
              radial velocities, apparent brightnesses, and colors will permit               
              accurate estimates of the masses and luminosities of the white                 
              dwarfs.  High resolution spectra will be obtained of these objects             
              in order to estimate the surface chemical compositions and magnetic            
              field strengths.  When completed, this study is expected to permit             
              the compilation of the most accurate and homogeneous physical                  
              parameters for white dwarfs to date.
