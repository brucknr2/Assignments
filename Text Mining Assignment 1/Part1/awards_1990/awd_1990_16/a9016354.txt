Abstract    :
                   This project examines the use of multilevel codes for the                 
              fading channel.  It is observed that, since the performance metric             
              on this is not Euclidean distance but error event length,                      
              multilevel codes provide a simple yet effective means of designing             
              codes to achieve a desired level of diversity.  In addition,                   
              multistage and parallel decoding techniques can simply decoder                 
              design and minimize decoding delay when multilevel codes are used.             
              This project undertakes code design for the fading channel and                 
              various decoder structures in order to achieve high performance at             
              minimum cost.  Unification of multilevel coding theory with                    
              multidimensional coding theory, and application of distance and                
              performance theorems available for multilevel codes to                         
              multidimensional codes is another goal.
