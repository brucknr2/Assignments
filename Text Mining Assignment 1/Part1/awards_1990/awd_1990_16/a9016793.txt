Abstract    :
                   Miconia (family Melastomaceae) is a large and diverse genus               
              of tropical shrubs, some of which are relatively rare.  The genus              
              itself is not well-marked and probably is not monophyletic.  In                
              addition, the intrageneric boundaries are unclear with respect to              
              assignment of the species to the various sections.  Therefore, the             
              genus is in need of in-depth taxonomic revision.  The PI proposes              
              to initiate this task with an analysis of phylogenetic                         
              relationships among the species of section Chaenopleura, which is              
              restricted to the West Indies.  This aspect of the investigation               
              will be based primarily on gross morphology and will involve the               
              use of mainland species to polarize character transformations and              
              parsimony-analyses to derive patterns of evolution in the genus.               
              The PI then proposes to revise the section based on his                        
              phylogenetic analysis; to write a monograph to include complete,               
              detailed descriptions; and to write a key to the species.  He and              
              a collaborator will collect fresh specimens for the study.
