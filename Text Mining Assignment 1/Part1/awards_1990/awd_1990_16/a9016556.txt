Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The project will develop a fuzzy set                                           
              framework to deal with the effects of                                          
              climatic changes on water resources                                            
              management and with the uncertainties in the                                   
              prediction of hydrometeorologic extremes,                                      
              such as floods and droughts, under changing                                    
              climatologic conditions.  Probabilistic and                                    
              fuzzy set analyses will be combined and                                        
              historical data will be used to link local                                     
              climate elements to global circulation models                                  
              for the generation of circulation patterns.                                    
              Anomalies in these patters usually produce                                     
              drought or flood and these events will be                                      
              developed as time series.  Forecasting will                                    
              be carried out of such time series on the                                      
              basis of circulation pattern series and some                                   
              of these forecasts will be used in water                                       
              resources decision-making, e.g., reservoir                                     
              operation.  The value of this research will                                    
              be to provide theoretical bases to                                             
              engineering techniques for taking climatic                                     
              fluctuations and global changes into account                                   
              in decision-making related to extreme                                          
              droughts and floods.
