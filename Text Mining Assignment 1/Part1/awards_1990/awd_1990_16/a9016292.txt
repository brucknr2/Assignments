Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Western Washington University proposes to implement a Minorities               
              in Marine Science Undergraduate Program (MIMSUP) at the Shannon                
              Point Marine Center.  This program will recruit minority                       
              undergraduates for two quarters of their junior year.                          
              Approximately eight minority students will join other WWU                      
              students in an educational program that combines an initial phase              
              of specialized group instruction, followed by formal courses in                
              an integrated setting. The Winter Quarter provides fundamental                 
              training in the physical, chemical and biological processes basic              
              to marine science; workshops on use of sophisticated analytical                
              instrumentation; participation in monitoring and research                      
              projects; a journal club; and field trips.  The Spring Quarter                 
              includes three marine science courses. Students will receive 30                
              credits for these two quarters. WWU has allocated a faculty                    
              position to Shannon Point to supervise the program.
