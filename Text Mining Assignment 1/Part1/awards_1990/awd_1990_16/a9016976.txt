Abstract    :
                   The southern high latitude troposphere (south of 60o S), in               
              contrast to the Arctic troposphere, lies over an elevated ice-                 
              covered continent and is completely surrounded by the extensive                
              and biologically active southern oceans.  It links the rest of                 
              the global atmosphere and the oceans with the Antarctic ice sheet              
              and stratosphere that are the focus of intense global change                   
              research today.  Relatively few coordinated studies of Antarctic               
              tropospheric chemistry and its controlling factors have been                   
              undertaken, despite the immense potential of tropospheric                      
              processes to affect climate, for example through changes in the                
              production of cloud nuclei, and hence cloud metaphysics                        
              properties, that may ultimately and significantly affect the                   
              radiation balance over the high latitude oceanic regions.                      
                                                                                             
                   The topics to be highlighted in this symposium are:                       
                                                                                             
                   1.  Aerosols and gases in the troposphere:  sources, sinks,               
                   and occurrence.                                                           
                                                                                             
                   2.  Air-surface exchange.                                                 
                                                                                             
                   3.  Troposphere-stratosphere exchange.                                    
                                                                                             
                   4.  Ice-snow chemistry related to tropospheric composition                
                   and climate.                                                              
                                                                                             
                   5.  Chemistry and physics of clouds.                                      
                                                                                             
                   6.  Role of meteorological processes.
