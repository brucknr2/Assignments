Abstract    :
              The Joint Oceanographic Institutions, Inc., will provide support for a         
              broad range of Federal interagency scientific planning activities in           
              oceanography and closely related research and technology.  A major             
              focus will be to assist in improving interaction between in situ               
              research and satellite remote sensing in programs such as the World            
              Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE), the Joint Global Ocean Flux Study         
              (JGOFS), and the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Program (GLOBEC).  Workshops        
              will be conducted on specialized topics of interest to these programs,         
              such as ocean surface layer salinity and the feasibility of its                
              measurement by satellite.  Similarly, support will be provided for             
              development of more effective international coordination of the above-         
              referenced and other U.S. global geoscience research programs with             
              analogous efforts in other countries.
