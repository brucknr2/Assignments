Abstract    :
              Professor Scoles is supported by a grant from the Experimental                 
              Physical Chemistry Program to study the structure and dynamics                 
              of molecules in clusters using molecular beams and infrared                    
              lasers.  These studies should enhance our knowledge of                         
              interactions between molecules and their dependence on                         
              intramolecular motion.                                                         
                                                                                             
              There are several projects all using IR laser spectroscopy and                 
              molecular beams.  These are IR spectroscopy  (1) of molecules                  
              seeded in clusters, (2) of van der Waals molecules, (3) of                     
              polyatomic molecules under high resolution, (4) by multiphoton                 
              excitation, and (5) of physisorbed molecules on a single                       
              crystal surface.  Professor Scoles will measure directly the                   
              temperature of unsupported molecular clusters and take                         
              vibrational spectra of neutral molecules imbedded in highly                    
              quantum clusters of para-hydrogen and helium. The                              
              state-resolved intramolecular vibrational relaxation and IR                    
              multiphoton excitation studies are aimed at improving our                      
              understanding of, and control of, intramolecular motion and                    
              regioselective reactivity and clarifying the influence of the                  
              coherence of the exciting light on this type of phenomena.  IR                 
              spectroscopy will also be used to study monolayers of gases                    
              physisorbed on single crystal surfaces which have been                         
              structurally characterized using low energy helium beam                        
              diffraction.
