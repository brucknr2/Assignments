Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award provides support for a cooperative research                         
              project between Professor Matthew Tirrell, Department of                       
              Chemical Engineering and Materials Science, University of                      
              Minnesota and Professor Tadao Kotaka, Department of Macro-                     
              molecular Science, Osaka University, Japan.  The objectives                    
              of the project are to investigate, both experimentally and                     
              theoretically, the morphology and some aspects of the                          
              properties of model block polymers adsorbed and confined on                    
              surfaces of substrates of various types.  Block polymers                       
              confined in two-dimensional regions, such as those adsorbed                    
              on surfaces of given substrates, are in a special thermodynamic                
              state different from that of a more familiar three-dimensional                 
              bulk.  Physico-chemical properties of such thin layers are                     
              very important scientifically, in the sense that surfaces may                  
              alter thermodynamic order-disorder transitions, as well as                     
              for practical applications such as adhesion, surface                           
              modification and functionalization.  The researchers will                      
              study the relationships among surface morphology, molecular                    
              structure and surface physico-chemical properties of block                     
              polymers confined on two-dimensional structures, to clarify                    
              the factors controlling the surface morphology of the block                    
              polymers, and to obtain information on how to attain well-                     
              controlled surface morphology formation, modification and                      
              functionalization.                                                             
                                                                                             
              The strengths of the two research teams are very complementary,                
              the Japanese team having a great deal of experience in                         
              synthesis and characterization under conventional means and                    
              the US team having almost unique expertise in characterization                 
              of surfaces and materials in confined dimensions.  These                       
              studies will hopefully yield new ways of preparing films with                  
              specific morphologies and consequently, novel properties,                      
              thus enhancing our ability to fabricate films with desired                     
              characteristics for technological applications.
