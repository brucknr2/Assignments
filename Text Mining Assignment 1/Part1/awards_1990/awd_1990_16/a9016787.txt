Abstract    :
                   This research is aimed at developing a reliable manufacturing             
              process to fabricate fine superconducting, flexible wires capable              
              of carrying current densities in the order of 10,000 amperes/square            
              centimeters under zero field and at least 1,000 amperes/square                 
              centimeters in one Tesla magnetic field.  The research encompasses             
              processing issues, including the parameters controlling toughness              
              of the engineered material, the role of thermomechanical treatment             
              on current density and the understanding of the critical material              
              microstructural parameters and their relationship to the processing            
              procedures.                                                                    
                   The much sought after characteristic of design of materials               
              and materials processing operations to produce microstructures for             
              optimized (superconducting) performance will be obtained from this             
              research.
