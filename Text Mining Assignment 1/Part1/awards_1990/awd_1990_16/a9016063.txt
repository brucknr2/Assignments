Abstract    :
              Heterodyne millimeter and submillimeter wave                                   
              receivers presently use whisker-contacted                                      
              Schottky barrier diodes for the best possible                                  
              sensitivity.  However, planar Schottky diodes                                  
              from this laboratory and others are beginning                                  
              to be utilized at the lower frequencies (100-                                  
              283 GHz) with excellent results ?1,2!.  This                                   
              work will ultimately lead to the development                                   
              of reliable millimeter wave integrated                                         
              circuits and planar antenna arrays.                                            
              Optimization of the device structure will move                                 
              the operating frequency into the submillimeter                                 
              range.  Cooperative NSF sponsored research                                     
              over the past 3 years between the University                                   
              of Virginia and Fort Monmouth ETDL has                                         
              resulted in the design and fabrication of                                      
              whiskerless diodes with excellent DC and RF                                    
              characteristics.  This objective of the                                        
              proposed research is to continue work on the                                   
              whiskerless diode for mixer and varactor                                       
              applications at signal frequencies at and                                      
              above 100 GHz.
