Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Pacific Coast Irises are a group of eleven closely related                 
              plant species.  That many species pairs form fertile hybrids in                
              the wild makes them an ideal system for the study of speciation.               
              This is a proposal to study three of the naturally occurring                   
              hybrid zones, analyzing at least eight characters per hybrid                   
              zone, to see (1) if the character's frequency distributions                    
              coincide, and (2) if these distributions are concordant along                  
              transects within and between hybrid zones.  To complement these                
              studies of patterns of variation, the following potential                      
              barriers to gene flow will be examined: habitat association,                   
              flowering time, dispersal rate and the fitness of hybrids.  The                
              hybrid zone studies will be placed in the context of a phylogeny               
              of the entire group of irises, relying on  cladistic analysis of               
              morphological and molecular (cpDNA, rDNA, allozymes) characters.
