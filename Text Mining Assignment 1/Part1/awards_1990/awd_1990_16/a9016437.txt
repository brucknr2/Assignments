Abstract    :
              Under an NSF Grant we have developed                                           
              some of the essential elements of an x-ray                                     
              lithography technology for replicating sum-                                    
              100nm features (so called x-ray                                                
              nanolithography), including: durable mask                                      
              membranes; means of patterning with e-beam                                     
              and focused-ion beam systems; gap control via                                  
              studs and piezoelectric drives; and a first-                                   
              stage alignment system.  In addition, we                                       
              demonstrated that Auger and photoelectrons                                     
              are not a limiting factor in nanolithography.                                  
              As a result of this work, x-ray nanolithography                                
              has been used in the fabrication of a number                                   
              of novel quantum-effect devices and                                            
              structures, and is now considered a key                                        
              enabling technology for future                                                 
              nanoelectronics.  Renewal of this grant will                                   
              enable to further perfect the alignment                                        
              system, making it capable of sub-100nm                                         
              alignment; improve the methods of making                                       
              nanolithography masks, including better e-                                     
              beam techniques and diamond membranes;                                         
              study in detail the problem of diffraction from                                
              x-ray absorber patterns, including the effect of                               
              phase shifts; study the feasibility of non-                                    
              damaging contact.  The result of this research                                 
              should be a reliable means of replicating                                      
              complex, large-area patterns having features                                   
              approaching 10nm.
