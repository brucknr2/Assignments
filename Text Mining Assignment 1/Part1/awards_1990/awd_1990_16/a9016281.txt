Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The 1988 fires that burned Yellowstone National Park present              
              a unique opportunity to investigate ecological responses to                    
              large-scale disturbance. A striking feature of the fires was the               
              resulting heterogeneity of the burned landscape, in terms of                   
              both the overall burning patterns and the variable fire severity               
              within the burned areas.  Few ecological studies have dealt                    
              explicitly with the spatial variation of disturbance effects in a              
              systematic and quantitative way.  And previous research suggests               
              that species' responses to disturbance may vary not only in                    
              relation to moisture, temperature, and other environmental                     
              gradients, but also with the size, shape, and heterogeneity of                 
              disturbed sites. The 1988 fires present a unique opportunity for               
              ecologists to study plant reestablishment following large-scale                
              fires.                                                                         
                   Drs. Romme, Turner and Gardner will evaluate the relative                 
              importance of size and spatial patterning of fire-created patches              
              in the Yellowstone landscape for reestablishment of plant species              
              representing different modes of reproduction.  The investigators               
              hypothesize that the rates of plant reestablishment are                        
              controlled in part by the geometry of the landscape, but that the              
              relative importance of landscape structure differs with the                    
              plant's mode of reproduction.                                                  
                   These investigators are highly qualified experts in the area              
              of landscape ecology. The institutional support for this research              
              is outstanding.
