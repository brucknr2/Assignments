Abstract    :
              With this award, the Synthetic Organic Program will support the                
              research of Dr. Weston T. Borden of the Department of Chemistry                
              at the University of Washington.  The proposed research                        
              includes an integrated combination of experimental and                         
              computational chemistry leading to the preparation and                         
              understanding of the chemistry of highly strained organic                      
              molecules.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              In the experimental portion of the work, the preparation and                   
              study of the properties of a series of pyramidalized alkenes                   
              will be undertaken.  The compounds will be isolated using                      
              matrix techniques and will serve as precursors to other                        
              interesting strained molecules and to a series of Pt complexes.                
              In the computational work, among other projects, ab initio                     
              calculations will be carried out in order to test the effect of                
              substituents on cubyl cation, homocub-1(9)-ene, and the Cope                   
              rearrangement.  Calculations will also be carried out that will                
              serve to guide and interpret experimental studies of Pt                        
              complexes of pyramidalized alkenes.
