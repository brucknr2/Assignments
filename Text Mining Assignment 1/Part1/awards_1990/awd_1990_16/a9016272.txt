Abstract    :
              This grant supports a workshop to Appraise                                     
              Research Opportunities in Nanometer Scale                                      
              Science and Technology, to be held in                                          
              Baltimore, Maryland, July 26-27, 1990, in                                      
              conjunction with the Fifth International                                       
              Conference on Scanning Tunneling Microscopy                                    
              and the First International Conference on                                      
              Nanometer Scale Science and Technology.                                        
              The joint conferences will attract world                                       
              experts in the field to discuss state-of-                                      
              the-art results both in analytical tool                                        
              development and in the nanometer-scale                                         
              science and technology made possible by                                        
              these new tools.  This is a field which is                                     
              rapidly producing major advances in                                            
              materials understanding and new device                                         
              technologies.  By taking advantages of the                                     
              presence of these experts, the proposed                                        
              workshop will review progress in these                                         
              areas; identify research opportunities,                                        
              assess the potential impact of nanometer                                       
              scale research; assess government, academic                                    
              and industrial research plans; and                                             
              recommend resource allocation strategies.                                      
              The results of the workshop will be                                            
              published in the Journal of Vacuum Science                                     
              and Technology in order to widely                                              
              disseminate the information to the                                             
              community.
