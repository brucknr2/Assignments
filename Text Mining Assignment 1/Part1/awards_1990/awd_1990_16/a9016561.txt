Abstract    :
                                       Project Summary                                        
                                                                                            
              The District Eleven Weather Study Program (DEWS) is a successful               
              science education project in the Bronx New York school system.                 
              ATM provided assistance in starting this project.  The project                 
              demonstrates that when fifth-grade students are given the                      
              opportunity to participate in highly-motivational activities in                
              weather study, they will acquire skills in basic scientific                    
              procedures, positive attitudes towards the study of science, and               
              a greater awareness of career opportunities in sciences,                       
              especially in meteorology.  Increased costs associated with the                
              project that could not be accommodated in this year's Bronx                    
              school system budget threaten the continued existence of the                   
              project.  NSF support will enable the purchase of a new facsimile              
              machine require as a result of recent changes in the National                  
              Weather Services (NWS) policy.  Also, funding will support                     
              anticipated increased costs associated with receiving satellite-               
              imagery and weather-graphics transmissions.
