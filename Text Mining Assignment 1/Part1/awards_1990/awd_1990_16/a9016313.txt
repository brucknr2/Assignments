Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research in the analytic theory of                
              automorphic forms of Professor Isaac Efrat of the University of                
              Maryland at College Park. Dr. Efrat has proposed to investigate a              
              collection of problems in the harmonic analysis of graphs and                  
              surfaces that arise as quotients of spaces of rank one, modulo                 
              discrete groups. These problems stem from questions about the                  
              existence of discrete spectra for such groups, and the construc-               
              tion of discrete eigenfunctions for them. Other aspects of                     
              Professor Efrat's project involve the study of certain arith-                  
              metically defined Eisenstein series attached to non-congruence                 
              subgroups.                                                                     
                   Non-Euclidean plane geometry began in the early nineteenth                
              century as a mathematical curiosity, but by the end of that                    
              century, mathematicians had realized that many objects of                      
              fundamental importance are non-Euclidean in their basic nature.                
              The detailed study of non-Euclidean plane geometries has given                 
              rise to several branches of modern mathematics, of which the                   
              study of modular and automorphic forms is one of the most active.              
              This field is principally concerned with questions about the                   
              whole numbers, but in its use of geometry and analysis, it                     
              retains connection to its historical roots.
