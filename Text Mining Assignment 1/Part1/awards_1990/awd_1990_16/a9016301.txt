Abstract    :
              This project describes a new approach to study micro- and nano-                
              fabricated structures whose physical dimensions new effects                    
              originating because the wavelength of the quantum excitations have             
              dimensions of the order of the physical structures involved.  By               
              exploiting the ability to fabricate free-standing  metallic                    
              microstructures with dimensions as small as 25 nm, it is possible              
              to decouple these microstructures from the bulk phonons emanating              
              from the substrate.  This permits the phonon density of states to              
              be controlled systematically, and thus provides a unique                       
              opportunity to study the electrical and lattice properties of low              
              dimensional systems.  The consequences of low phonon dimensionality            
              on the electron-phonon interaction will be investigated by                     
              measurements of electron inelastic scattering and thermal transport            
              properties of the electron gas.  Interference properties of                    
              superconductors will also be studied using materials prepared by a             
              similar fabrication process.  This should allow the injection of               
              quasiparticles into the superconductor, as well as superconducting             
              pairs into the adjacent normal metal.  This can be done with a                 
              spatial resolution smaller than the coherence length, thus                     
              providing a route to "imaging" proximity effects in junctions and,             
              possibly, providing a determination of the relation between                    
              superconducting transition temperatures and characteristic lengths             
              in materials.
