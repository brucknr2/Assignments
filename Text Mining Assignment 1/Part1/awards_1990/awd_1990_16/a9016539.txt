Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This grant deals with the problem of what happens when solar              
              UV radiation interacts with Planetary Atmosphere, especially the               
              atmosphere of the earth.  When solar radiation is incident upon a              
              planet's atmosphere the resulting interaction depends critically               
              on the wavelength of the solar radiation.  While rayleigh                      
              scattering of the visible light causes a blue sky, the more                    
              energetic radiation  below 2000 nm can cause dissociation,                     
              ionization, and dissociative ionization of the atmospheric                     
              molecules.  These modified components of a planetary atmosphere                
              may react with the ambient species to form a source of new                     
              molecules in the atmosphere, while the results of ionization                   
              produces the ionosphere.  It is the purpose of the research                    
              proposed herein to investigate what happens when solar radiation               
              interacts with a planetary atmosphere and to provide absolute                  
              cross sections for each of the specific interaction processes as               
              a function of wavelength.  Some of the processes to be studied                 
              are also of interest in the study of comets and the interstellar               
              medium.  The wavelength range proposed is from 10nm to 140 nm.
