Abstract    :
              This award supports cooperative research on linear algebra                     
              between Terry Loring of the University of New Mexico and Ruy                   
              Exel of the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil.  Approximately                  
              finite-dimensional (AF) algebras are C*-algebras which are                     
              the inductive limits of algebras of matrices.  Since the                       
              dimension of these matrices can grow arbitrarily fast in the                   
              inductive system, many of the results from linear algebra are                  
              not useful, at least in the context of AF algebras, because                    
              of the dependence on dimension.  This research will attempt                    
              to develop new invariants of more general collections of                       
              matrices that almost satisfy a set of relations, especially                    
              invariants that will have an impact on research in C*-algebras.                
                                                                                             
              The most important rationale for this proposed collaboration                   
              is the complementary expertise of the applicants.  The                         
              project will combine Exel's expertise in generalized                           
              determinants, and together with Loring's expertise in AF                       
              algebras and related issues in operator theory.  Their                         
              combined expertise has led them to obtain some interesting                     
              invariants for the case of almost commuting matrices.
