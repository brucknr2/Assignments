Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A joint U.S.-Soviet workshop will attempt to identify,                         
              develop, and coordinate databases on arctic flora and                          
              fauna.  There is at present no coordinated system for                          
              retrieving such data or to record new data about as yet                        
              undiscovered species in the arctic.  The ecology of the                        
              arctic regions is extremely fragile and susceptible to                         
              stresses caused by economic development and global                             
              climate change.  The objective of this workshop is to                          
              begin laying a baseline of data about arctic ecology for                       
              subsequent studies of biodiversity and global climate                          
              change.  The meeting is being organized by Dr. David                           
              Murray of the University of Alaska at Fairbanks and                            
              Academician Vladimir Sokolov of the Institute of                               
              Evolutionary Animal Morphology and Ecology of the

              This project fulfills the program objective of advancing                       
              scientific knowledge by enabling leading researchers in                        
              the United States and the U.S.S.R. to combine                                  
              complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of                             
              strong mutual interest and competence in the field of                          
              basic scientific research on the basis of equality,                            
              reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.
