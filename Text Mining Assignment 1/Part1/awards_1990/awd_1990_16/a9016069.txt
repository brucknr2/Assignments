Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will measure the rates of NH+4 and NO-3                           
              assimilation, nitrification and nitrogen fixation in the Sargasso              
              Sea over a seasonal cycle in conjunction with the ongoing Bermuda              
              Atlantic time series (BATS) study.  These measurements are                     
              designed to assess the rate of new production, including both                  
              nitrate uptake by the plankton and nitrogen fixation, and to                   
              assess the regeneration rates of the inorganic substrates.  Size               
              fractionation by filtration and cell sorting by flow cytometry                 
              will be used to identify the assimilation of inorganic nitrogen                
              by different components of the plankton community.  Studies of                 
              the nitrogen cycle in an oligotrophic gyre over a seasonal cycle,              
              together with other U.S. JGOFS research, will increase our                     
              understanding of the physical and biological controls on new and               
              regenerated production.                                                        
                                                                                             
              The nitrogen cycling measurements will employ trace metal clean                
              precautions during ondeck incubations with 15N.  Recently                      
              improved analytical techniques for measuring low ambient                       
              concentrations of NH+4 and NO-3 will be used to monitor nutrient               
              concentrations during the multiple time point incubations and to               
              ensure tracer level additions are made.  Care will be taken to                 
              account for substrate regeneration and to construct an inventory               
              of the added label.
