Abstract    :
                 The principal investigator (PI) will study the development of               
              adaptive error control algorithms for bandwidth-limited                        
              nonstationary communication channels.  These algorithms will be                
              based on trellis coded modulation systems that have been modified              
              to make use of a feedback channel.  The feedback channel allows for            
              the flow of channel state information from the receiver to the                 
              transmitter.  The transmitter uses this information to reconfigure             
              data structures in accordance with variations in channel noise and             
              attenuation.  Three basic questions will be considered in the                  
              development of the adaptive algorithms.  First, how can the                    
              receiver derive channel state information from received data                   
              blocks?  Secondly, how can the receiver use the feedback channel               
              to report this information to the transmitter? Finally, how is the             
              transmitter to respond to this information? Adaptive schemes will              
              be developed, analyzed and simulated for a variety of channels.
