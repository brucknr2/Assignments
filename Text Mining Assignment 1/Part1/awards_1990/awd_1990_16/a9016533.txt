Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports continuing investigations, at both optical and             
              radio wavelength, of gravitational lenses.  The principle                      
              investigator is one of the worlds leading investigators of these               
              objects.  In addition to the study of individual objects, the                  
              completion of a large survey will provide further new examples of              
              gravitational lenses, which may be used to investigate important               
              questions of cosmology and the distribution of mass in the                     
              universe.
