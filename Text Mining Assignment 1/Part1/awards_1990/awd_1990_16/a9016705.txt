Abstract    :
              This Grant for Exploratory Research is in the general area of                  
              inorganic chemistry.  Dr. Kenneth J. Balkus of the Chemistry                   
              Department of the University of Texas at Dallas will explore                   
              the use of metal complexes as templates for the synthesis of                   
              new zeolites.  Zeolites are used as catalyst supports and their                
              shape selectivity, polarizability, and acid/base properties are                
              important factors in catalytic activity.                                       
                                                                                             
              The goals of the research are to establish which metal                         
              complexes will serve as templates for crystalline zeolites, the                
              types of zeolites that can be prepared under certain conditions                
              of temperature and solvent, and the advantages of the zeolite                  
              encapsulated complexes as hydrogenation catalysts.  The ligands                
              to be used are polyaza macrocycles, such as tridentate                         
              bis(pyridylimino)isoindoline, and the metals include rhodium                   
              and platinum.
