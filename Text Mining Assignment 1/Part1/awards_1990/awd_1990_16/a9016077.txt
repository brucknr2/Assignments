Abstract    :
                   The goal of the proposed research is the use of the extensive             
              experience base of the investigator in sequence design to design               
              and study code sequences for a code-division (spread-spectrum)                 
              multiple-access (CDMA) communication system.  The primary interest             
              is the case when four phase signalling (QPSK) is the modulation                
              system.  The distinguishing feature of the four phase case compared            
              to the binary case is the symbol alphabet;  the symbols in a four              
              phase modulation alphabet form a ring and not a finite field.  In              
              the new design the work proceeds in a Galois ring.  Relationships              
              to previous results are developed. Understanding four phase                    
              sequences as well as as binary sequences are now understood is a               
              long term goal.
