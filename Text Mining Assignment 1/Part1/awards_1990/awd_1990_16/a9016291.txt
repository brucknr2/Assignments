Abstract    :
              This is an award to support exploratory research on a                          
              technique to decontaminate soil by use of electroosmosis.                      
              In this process, an ionic liquid under action of an                            
              applied electric field moves through the porous and                            
              permeable contaminated soil in a manner thought to be less                     
              conducive to channeling than pressure-drive flows.  The                        
              drive-liquid containing the contaminant is then replaced                       
              in the soil by a clean purge solution.  The contaminated                       
              fluid is collected for appropriate treatment.                                  
                                                                                             
              This proposal was submitted to NSF under conditions                            
              outlined in NSF 89-85, Small Grants for Exploratory                            
              Research (SGER).  The proposed research which addresses a                      
              topic of significant National interest, has previously                         
              been successfully applied in dewatering and consolidation                      
              of soils and may prove to be useful for removal of organic                     
              contaminants of soil.  It has significance and potentially                     
              direct application to removal of contaminants from soil                        
              alone and in conjunction with other physical, chemical and                     
              biological processes.
