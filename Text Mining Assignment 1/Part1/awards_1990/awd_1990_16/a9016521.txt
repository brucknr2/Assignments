Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Drs. Burton Jones, Arnold Klemola, and Robert Hanson at the Lick               
              Observatory, University of California, Santa Cruz will continue                
              work on the Lick Northern Proper Motion program.  Observations for             
              a major phase of the second epoch in this program are nearly                   
              complete, and the emphasis for the next two years will be on plate             
              measurements and the preparation of a machine readable form of the             
              survey.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              The study of the motions of various classes of stars is fundamental            
              to an understanding of our Galaxy.  Proper motions provide the                 
              observational basis for the study of solar motion, galactic                    
              rotation, and velocity dispersions, and for the statistical                    
              determination of stellar distances and luminosities.  The Lick                 
              Northern Proper Motion program will meet many of these basic                   
              observational needs by providing absolute proper motions for some              
              300,000 stars covering the northern two-thirds of the sky.
