Abstract    :
              Partial support is provided to the Fifth Trilateral Symposium                  
              on Catalysis to be held in Evanston, Illinois, on June 27-29,                  
              1991.  The title of the symposium is "Molecular Interactions                   
              in Heterogeneous Catalysis".  This funding will provide for                    
              attendence at the symposium of American researchers who would                  
              otherwise be unalbe to attend, especially younger                              
              investigators.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              This series of symposia, rotating among the three countries                    
              (U.S., China, and Japan) has developed into the major trans-                   
              Pacific forum for catalysis, and is a principal source for                     
              information on Japanese activity in the field.
