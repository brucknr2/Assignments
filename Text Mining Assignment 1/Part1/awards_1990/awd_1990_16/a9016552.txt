Abstract    :
                   The Great Lakes of east Africa house what may be the richest              
              concentration of freshwater species on earth.  Most spectacular                
              are the more than 1000 species of cichlid fishes.  If a lake is                
              despoiled, that entire fauna may be doomed.  At present, the most              
              severely threatened of all is Lake Victoria, largest lake in the               
              tropics and second largest in the world, whose endemic fishes are              
              now vanishing with incredible speed.                                           
                   The investigators will immediately initiate monitoring of                 
              the extinction process and obtain data critical to the framing of              
              process-oriented hypotheses.  The urgency and timeliness of this               
              work can not be overstated.  The biodiversity that resulted from               
              explosive speciation within Lake Victoria is a scientific                      
              resource of immense value, let alone its importance as a source                
              of protein for east African peoples.
