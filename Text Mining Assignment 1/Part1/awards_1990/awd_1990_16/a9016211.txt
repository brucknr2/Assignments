Abstract    :
              The research will investigate the appearance of instabilities and              
              performance degradation in computer communication networks; in                 
              particular, in CSMA/CD (IEEE 802.3) local area networks.  It will              
              be primarily analytic, with a substantial numerical component.  The            
              CSMA/CD model will incorporate extensive packet buffering,                     
              retransmission counters,and bursty packet arrivals on each network             
              node.  Criteria for network stability will be determined, and the              
              first exit time (the mean time to performance degradation in a                 
              heavily loaded network) will be computed analytically as a function            
              of network parameters.  The research is quite interdisciplinary,               
              including circuit switched networks,and models of local rather                 
              global bus contention.  The mathematical methods are analytic                  
              rather than numerical and allow precise determination of the                   
              transient behavior of unstable systems.  They are supplemented by              
              numerical computation and comparison with the results of network               
              simulation.
