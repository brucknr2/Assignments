Abstract    :
                   Proton auroral extreme ultraviolet emissions by the UC                    
              Berkeley Extreme UltraViolet spectrometer on satellite STP-78-1                
              will be examined.  The relationship between extreme ultraviolet                
              auroral emissions and the auroral proton flux will be                          
              investigated.  Proton and secondary electron energy fluxes will                
              be estimated from the measured emission intensities.  Linear                   
              transport models of proton and electron energy degradation and                 
              radiative transfer of optically thick resonance lines will be                  
              used in the analysis of the data.  Doppler shifts in Lyman a                   
              emission will be used to inter precipitating auroral proton                    
              energies.  ***
