Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award adds an experimental component to ongoing research on               
              exploiting type systems as a basis for interfacing dissimilar                  
              programming languages.  The experimentation will apply                         
              fundamental computer science insights to support software for                  
              parallel numeric supercomputing.  Three specific new efforts are               
              included:                                                                      
                                                                                             
                       1.  Adaption of polymorphic type checking and inference,              
                           as found in Standard ML, to  deal with vectors,                   
                           arrays and various numeric data types as in Fortran               
                           77;                                                               
                                                                                             
                       2.  Evaluation of "mixin" based inheritance as a                      
                           framework for structuring C-based numeric libraries               
                           into more modern and secure C++ clauses and                       
                                                                                             
                       3.  Exploitaion of declarative language concepts as a                 
                           high level "harness" for parallelizing large blocks               
                           of existing imperative code.                                      
                                                                                             
              This work will be performed while the Principal Investigator is                
              on sabbatical leave at Cornell University.  this opportunity will              
              take advantage of several unique resources: (i) collaboration                  
              with research groups in constructive type theory, language design              
              for physical and mathematical scientists, and applications of                  
              dataflow programming; (ii) interaction with the staff and users                
              of the Cornell Center for Theory and Simulation in Science and                 
              Engineering, and (iii) development of prototype software on                    
              Cornell's 48-node BBN Butterfly multiprocessor.
