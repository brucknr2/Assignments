Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The principal investigator will analyze how topology                      
              determines geometry in several settings.  He will study                        
              deformation theory for open 3-manifolds, geometrization of                     
              automorphisms of free groups, and parallels between                            
              renormalization theory and hyperbolic 3-manifolds which                        
              asymptotically fiber over a circle.                                            
                   A central theme in modern dynamical systems is the                        
              restriction topology puts on allowable dynamics and geometry.                  
              For example, on the surface of a sphere, every vector field must               
              have a singularity.  On the earth, this means that the wind                    
              cannot blow everywhere at once; there must be at least one spot                
              where the air does not move.  In this vein, the principal                      
              investigator will develop relationships between complex dynamics               
              and the geometry of three-dimensional hypersurfaces.
