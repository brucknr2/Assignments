Abstract    :
                   The aim of this research is to develop the scientific basis               
              and computational tools for predictive simulations of                          
              machining processes.  To this end, an integrated experimental                  
              and computational program is formulated which focusses on                      
              understanding and quantifying: (i) friction between the cutting                
              tool and the workpiece; (ii) accurate constitutive models for the              
              behavior of the workpiece under the temperature and loading                    
              conditions that occur during machining, and (iii) material                     
              failure leading to the creation of new free surfaces, including                
              the role of shear band localizations in the failure process.
