Abstract    :
                 The primary objective of this research is the development of                
              efficient techniques for reliable data transmission and storage.               
              The specific areas addressed include (1) tighter lower bounds for              
              the minimum distance of cyclic codes that can be easily computed               
              and applied to Goppa codes and generalized Goppa codes (2)                     
              efficient decoding algorithms that can fully realize the error                 
              correcting capability of these codes,and (3) extension of promising            
              approaches in decoding cyclic and Goppa Codes to improve the                   
              decoding of geometric Goppa codes.                                             
                                                                                             
              In the determination of tighter minimum distance bounds,                       
              investigations include root pattern characterization and codeword-             
              locator polynomial approaches, and efficient methods of finding                
              submatrices of the generalized Cauchy and generalized Vandermonde              
              types for the associated Reed-Solomon codes.  In decoding, the                 
              research includes a generalized Peterson procedure that can                    
              determine error locations from nonrecurrent dependence relations               
              among the syndromes.  A polynomial version of a fundamental                    
              iterative algorithm will be developed to provide a better                      
              alternative for hardware implementation.  Extensions of the                    
              generalized Peterson procedure will be sought to decode the two                
              subclasses of geometric Goppa codes, the elliptic codes, and the               
              Hermitian codes, up to the actual minimum distance.
