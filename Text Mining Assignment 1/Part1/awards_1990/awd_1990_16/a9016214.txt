Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              We plan to achieve these goals by applying the pulsed field                    
              technique to DNA sequencing by developing an instrument and                    
              switching conditions that will extend the capability of current                
              DNA sequencing apparatuses.  This project will increase the                    
              throughput of current DNA sequencing technology significantly and              
              will benefit all areas of research which use molecular                         
              approaches.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              This is a proposal to develop a 20,000 volt computer controlled                
              switching system for application in the pulsed field technique to              
              DNA sequencing by electrophoresis.  Optimum field inversion                    
              condition will be determined for separating single stranded DNA                
              as large as 2 kilobases.  The effect of parameters such as                     
              voltage gradients, buffer, temperature, switch times, switching                
              regimens, and composition and formulation of gel matrix on the                 
              resolution of large DNA fragments will be studied.  The goal is                
              to extend the amount of readable sequences from a DNA sequencing               
              gel.
