Abstract    :
              A workshop on research needs in friction will be coordinated by the            
              ASME.  Initial surveys will be made of major industry groups to                
              determine their most pressing research needs in friction.  A                   
              workshop will subsequently be convened to evaluate the current                 
              status of friction research, to formulate long-term basic research             
              programs which are both good science and responsive to the                     
              industrial needs, and to recommend priorities.  Areas of interest              
              include the fundamental nature of friction and the use of advanced             
              techniques for its study, the effects of surface structure and                 
              surface reactions on friction, and the interaction between friction            
              and mechanical vibrations and noise.
