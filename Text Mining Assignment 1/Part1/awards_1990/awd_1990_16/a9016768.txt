Abstract    :
                   The factors that control the production and depletion of                  
              supercooled water in the atmosphere are important to a variety of              
              scientific and practical issues including the production of                    
              precipitation and aircraft icing.  Under joint NSF and FAA                     
              sponsorship, the Winter Icing and Storms Project (WISP) will be                
              held in the winter of 1991 in the front range of Colorado.  The                
              primary goals of the WISP are to improve understanding of                      
              processes involved in the production and depletion of supercooled              
              liquid water content in winter storms and to improve forecast of               
              aircraft icing in winter storms.                                               
                                                                                             
              The Principal Investigator will participate in WISP by studying                
              the dynamical and microphysical processes in mesoscale                         
              snowbands.  The research will have two primary objectives.  First              
              of all, the storm flow fields derived from Doppler radar will be               
              used as input to a numerical model to investigate the important                
              microphysical processes in mesoscale snowbands.  Additionally, an              
              advanced radar technique, termed differential reflectivity                     
              measurements, will be used in conjunction with in situ aircraft                
              measurements in diagnostic studies of the storm's microphysics                 
              and to determine the utility of remote sensing of winter storm                 
              microphysical characteristics including the location of                        
              supercooled liquid water.
