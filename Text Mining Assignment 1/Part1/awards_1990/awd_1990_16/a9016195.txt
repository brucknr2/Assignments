Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Funds are requested to aid in the creation of a video archive of               
              fossil and recent carnivoran skulls, from which skull shape data               
              will be acquired photogrammetrically.  Description of skull shape              
              by a statically determinate truss network of short distances will              
              avoid several problems of many previous morphmetric data sets.                 
              ANalysis of variation in skull shape within species will be used               
              to derive shape characters suitable for cladistic phylogenetic                 
              analysis.  Mapping of skull shape characters onto independent                  
              hypotheses of caniform phylogeny will permit the analysis of                   
              several problems: (1) the coevolution of skull shape characters,               
              (2) the coevolution of skull shape with functional traits, and                 
              (3) the relationship between within-population covariance and                  
              directions of evolutionary change.  Data on well-preserved fossil              
              skulls of carnivorans and creodonts will be crucial to these                   
              analyses, in order to establish the primitive states of skull                  
              shape characters.  Analysis of skull shape should also provide                 
              new evidence for the taxonomic affinities of problematic fossil                
              taxa.
