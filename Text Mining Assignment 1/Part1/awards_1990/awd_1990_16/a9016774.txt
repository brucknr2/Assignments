Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Chronic malnutrition affects children living in poverty and can                
              result in deficits in cognitive development and limit school                   
              performance.  As such, chronic malnutrition in childhood                       
              positively correlates with later health, growth attained and                   
              economic success as an adult.  Child development may be modified               
              by a number of factors other than malnutrition, including                      
              aspects of family life.  This research will investigate the                    
              relationship between insufficient nutrition, poverty, school                   
              performance and the mechanisms by which family practices can                   
              mediate these effects.  Multiple measures of childhood                         
              functioning will be utilized to validate the results.  The study               
              site will be in rural Belize.  It is hypothesized that 1)                      
              children exhibiting the effects of chronic undernutrition will                 
              perform less well by a number of criteria than the better                      
              nourished; 2) that, while children of higher socioeconomic status              
              will perform better than the lower SES children,  3) within an                 
              SES children whose families provide stimulation will perform                   
              better than others.   Both general and local practices which                   
              contribute to social and intellectual development will be                      
              documented.
