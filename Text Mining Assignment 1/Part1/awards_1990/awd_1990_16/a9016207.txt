Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              It is now widely recognized that in view of the excellent                      
              science and engineering capabilities that exist in many countries              
              in all parts of the world, it is increasingly important for                    
              U.S. scientists and engineers to remain in close touch with the                
              activities and plans of their foreign colleagues, in part as a                 
              means for planning joint research programs with them.                          
              Additionally, gaining an understanding of many important                       
              scientific problems, such as those associated with the global                  
              environment, requires cooperative scientific efforts on a                      
              multinational basis.                                                           
                                                                                             
              U.S. scientists and engineers have a number of available                       
              mechanisms to maintain close communication with scientists and                 
              engineers in other countries.  Among the oldest and most                       
              extensive of these mechanisms are the non-governmental                         
              international disciplinary unions (the first was established in                
              1919) which today comprise the International Council of                        
              Scientific Unions (ICSU) in which more than 70 countries are                   
              represented.  National members of these unions, as well as                     
              ICSU-proper, are private scientific bodies whose activities are                
              normally determined by committees of working scientists.  In                   
              the United States, the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) is                   
              the official adhering body to ICSU and its unions, and NAS                     
              disciplinary and non-disciplinary staff officers manage U.S.                   
              participation on behalf of the U.S. National Committees for                    
              ICSU and those unions.
