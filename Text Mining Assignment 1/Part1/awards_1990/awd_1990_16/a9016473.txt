Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This project involves a program of stable isotope studies,                
              faunal studies and AMS 14C dating of high deposition rate                      
              sediment cores from an area of the Nova Scotian continental                    
              margin where there is little evidence for slump and turbidite                  
              activity.  It will be the first high-resolution climate proxy                  
              records for the last 15,000 yrs from a vast region in the                      
              northwestern Atlantic Ocean.  Preliminary delta 18O results on                 
              planktonic foraminifera from three piston cores spanning 4000 m                
              of water depth reveal distinctive features which allow                         
              correlation among the cores.  These features, which are not yet                
              14C dated, probably reflect discharge events of glacial                        
              meltwater to the Gulf of St. Lawrence and to the Labrador Sea.                 
              The project will develop the climate history of ice sheet decay                
              and surface ocean change based on faunal and stable isotopic                   
              studies, and will test hypotheses about the origin and the                     
              Younger Dryas cooling and other abrupt events.  Records of                     
              nutrient proxies will be recovered form benthic foraminifera to                
              test the response of deep ocean circulation to surface ocean                   
              temperature and salinity changes.                                              
                   This research is important because it seeks to improve                    
              knowledge of the processes responsible for rapid climate changes.
