Abstract    :
                   Waves propogate through all levels of the atmosphere,                     
              somewhat analagous to waves in the ocean, and serve to couple the              
              upper and lower atmosphere regions by virtue of the energy and                 
              momentum that they carry.  Waves known as traveling ionic                      
              disturbances originate in the auroral zones and travel globally,               
              while waves known as infrasonde have relatively nearby sources                 
              and restricted regional effects.  The majority of waves arise                  
              from meteorological events and propagate thousands of kilometers               
              and ascend to great height with exponential growth.  The work in               
              this project is aimed at developing theoretical understanding of               
              acoustic gravity waves (AGW) in the upper atmosphere with efforts              
              concentrated in five particular areas:  1) participation in the                
              World Acoustic Gravity Wave Study (WAGS), 2) studies of                        
              atmospheric waves and turbulence by coherent radars, 3) model                  
              computation of AGW propagation in a realistic atmosphere, 4)                   
              nonlinear interaction of mesoscale perturbations in the                        
              atmosphere, and 5) modeling of the middle atmosphere gravity wave              
              continuum in terms of chaos.
