Abstract    :
              Funding is requested for a mini-super class computer unit which                
              will facilitate an environment for sophisticated calculations in               
                                                                                             
              the areas of biochemistry and biophysics.  The requested                       
              equipment, which is comprised of a processor (both scalar and                  
              vector), 64 Mb operation memory and 4Gb disk storage will be put               
                                                                                             
              together with the CONVEX 210 mini-supercomputer systems which was              
                                                                                             
              purchased last year by the Chemistry Department through an NSF                 
              grant with a substantial contribution from the University of                   
              Arizona.  The new mini-super computer unit will be shared by the

              scale, biologically related computing.  The research studies to                
              be performed with this computer will include the following areas               
                                                                                             
              of activity: development of quantum chemical ab-initio methods                 
              more conducive to the treatment of molecular systems with up to                
              one hundred electrons; quantum mechanical studies of elemental                 
              biological processes; theoretical modeling of various physical                 
              and chemical properties of biomolecules; determination of                      
              structures and dynamical behavior of a wide range of biologically              
                                                                                             
              active molecules in the gas-phase and in solutions using                       
              molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations; and various                    
              experimental interfaces including 2-D and 3-D NMR.
