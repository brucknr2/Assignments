Abstract    :
              The understanding of the transport phenomena associated with                   
              the melting of packed particulate beds is critical to our                      
              ability to predict processes which occur during severe nuclear                 
              power plant accidents, or for the containment of radioactive                   
              wastes through in situ vitrification, and for a wide range of                  
              materials processing techniques which depend on powders as a                   
              raw material.  This program, the first indepth study of heat                   
              and mass transfer during melting of packed particulate beds,                   
              involves both experimental and numerical research.  The                        
              objective is to determine the transport properties for melting                 
              packed beds essential to modelling the melting process.  These                 
              properties include effective thermal conductivity, capillary                   
              pressure, and relative permeability.  In addition, the shape                   
              of melting particles is critical to modelling the                              
              densification which occurs during melting.  The results of                     
              this research will enable the melting process to be accurately                 
              modelled.  This will allow the process to be designed to                       
              achieve desired objectives in a wide range of applications                     
              ranging from vitrification of hazardous wastes to the                          
              production of new materials.
