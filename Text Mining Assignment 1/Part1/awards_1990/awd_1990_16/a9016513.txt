Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic                  
              Program supports the continued work of Dr. Clifford Kubiak of                  
              the Department of Chemistry, Purdue University, on the design                  
              and synthesis of new compounds which will activate and reduce                  
              carbon dioxide.  In this project, Kubiak will study ways to                    
              form carbon-carbon bonds by coupling carbon dioxide molecules.                 
                                                                                             
              Binuclear transition metal complexes will be tested as means to                
              provide the electrons needed for the coupling reaction.                        
              Single-bonded Ir, Rh, Ni and Pt complexes will be prepared and                 
              photolyzed by laser transient absorbance techniques.  The                      
              photoinduced cleavage of the metal-metal bond will provide two                 
              electrons for bond formation.  The complexes are designed to                   
              form radical transients which are "tuned" for carbon dioxide                   
              reduction.  The photogenerated radicals will be characterized                  
              using an infrared detector supported by this grant.  The                       
              project is based on past findings that structural changes in                   
              certain binuclear compounds make them effective in photoinduced                
              electron transfer reactions.
