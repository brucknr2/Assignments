Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A long-baseline spatial interferometer for the 10 microns                      
              wavelength region using two movable 1.65 m telescopes has recently             
              been completed and installed on Mount Wilson.  Baselines have been             
              laid out for distances up to 35 m; they can be extended in some                
              directions to about 100 m.  Although in the long run an extensive              
              and varied observational program can be carried out, present                   
              observations emphasize an intensive study of the structure of dust             
              shells around stars, their change with time, and the sizes and                 
              changes in the disks of stars obscured at visable wavelengths.                 
              Support is requested for some improvements to the system to                    
              facilitate work on stars with weak emission at visible wavelengths,            
              to enhance the precision and facility with which data on                       
              visibilities can be taken, and to provide better facilities to                 
              analyze the substantial amount of data which is produced.
