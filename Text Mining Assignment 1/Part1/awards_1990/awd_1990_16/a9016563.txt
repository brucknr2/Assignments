Abstract    :
                   Using a unique data set of ten spring-summer seasons, a                   
              series of hypotheses will be tested to define more precisely the               
              seasonal and interannual variability of snow melt, surface albedo              
              and late-summer ice extent, its climatic significance, and                     
              relationships with surface pressure fields and heights,                        
              temperature anomalies and other atmospheric indices. This will                 
              constitute an expansion of previous work under NSF support for 1)              
              an initial study of snow melt/climate interactions based on four               
              seasons (1977, 1979, 1984, 1985) of data and 2) the basic data                 
              set preparation only (no analysis) of six additional seasons                   
              (1975, 1978, 1980, 1986-1988).                                                 
                   The analysis will be performed using digitized ten-season                 
              data sets of snow melt stages and parameterized surface albedo                 
              constructed from Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP)               
              imagery for May through mid-August and coincident sea ice and                  
              atmospheric data from other sources.                                           
                   The timing and extent of snow melt atop the Arctic pack ice               
              is an important climatic forcing factor of northern high                       
              latitudes, with implications for the long-term mass balance and                
              stability of the ice and potential climatic impacts in other                   
              parts of the Northern Hemisphere.  It may also serve as an                     
              indicator of climatic change forced by increasing greenhouse gas               
              concentrations.
