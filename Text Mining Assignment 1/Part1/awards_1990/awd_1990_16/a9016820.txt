Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is supported Under NSF Announcement No. 90-23,                    
              "Repair and Rehabilitation Research for Seismic Resistance of                  
              Structures."                                                                   
                                                                                             
              Coordination is needed to:                                                     
                                                                                             
              1) develop a comprehensive technical document which can be                     
                 used to develop design requirements and details acceptable                  
                 for engineering practice                                                    
                                                                                             
              2) facilitate exchange of information between U.S. and foreign                 
                 researchers and designers                                                   
                                                                                             
              3) provide a mechanism for rapid transfer of technology from                   
                 research to practice                                                        
                                                                                             
              This principal investigator will be responsible for                            
              coordinating program activities between all PI's funded to                     
              undertake research study of seismic repair and rehabilitation                  
              of structures during the first year of work.
