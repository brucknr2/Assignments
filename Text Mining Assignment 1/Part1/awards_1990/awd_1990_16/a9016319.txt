Abstract    :
                   In the last twenty years, few areas of mathematics have                   
              developed as extensively as the theory of algebraic groups.  Recent            
              developments in the theory of infinite dimensional Lie algebras, in            
              noncommutative algebraic geometric analogues of algebraic groups               
              such as quantum groups, and in representation theory, suggest that             
              an overall assessment of recent progress might be in order.                    
                   This grant will support the 1991 Summer Research Institute on             
              Algebraic Groups and their Generalizations, to be held at                      
              Pennsylvania State University, July 8-28, 1991.  The three week                
              institute is the thirty-ninth in a series sponsored by the American            
              Mathematical Society which brings together groups of mathematicians            
              interested in a particular field of mathematical research.                     
              Emphasis is placed on instruction at a very high level with                    
              seminars and lectures by distinguished mathematicians in related               
              fields, to promote interaction between participants while                      
              broadening their mathematical perspectives.
