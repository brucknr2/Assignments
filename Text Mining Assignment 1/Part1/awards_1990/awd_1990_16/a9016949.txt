Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A plant pathogenic fungus in the economically-important genus                  
              Cochliobolus is the object of a study designed to examine the                  
              genetics of production of a cyclic-peptide, host-selective toxin               
              produced by the fungus.  To be examined is whether a 22kb stretch              
              of DNA is a gene cluster encoding all of the enzymes involved in               
              synthesis of the toxin; insights into the evolution of host-                   
              selective toxin production in this fungal genus should result from             
              these studies, as well.                                                        
                                                                                             
              The production of a host-selective toxin by a plant pathogenic,                
              economically important fungus is to be studied by techniques                   
              suitable for determining whether a particular region of DNA encodes            
              the several enzymes involved in synthesis of the cyclic-peptide                
              toxin.//
