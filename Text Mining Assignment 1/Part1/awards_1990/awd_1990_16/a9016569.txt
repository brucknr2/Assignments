Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              PI will study reports on women's participation in scientific                   
              fields, and develop a set of criteria for evaluating existing                  
              data bases on this topic.  Although the literature contains                    
              numerous reports on people involved in science, reports dealing                
              specifically with women in these fields are scattered and vary                 
              widely in the purposes of the report, the samples included, data               
              reported, reliability of facts, and quality of inferences made                 
              from the data.  This project will assess the state of the litera-              
              ture, identifying ways to find existing data, and presenting ways              
              to determine quality and generality of information contained in                
              them.  The outcome of this project will be a rating instrument                 
              usable by the PI and other investigators to judge the usefulness               
              of existing data bases on women in science.
