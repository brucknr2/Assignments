Abstract    :
                   Dr. Mangel and collaborator Dr. Paul Smith at NOAA will                   
              pursue a research program in which dynamic, state variable                     
              modeling will be used to predict the pelagic pattern of                        
              zooplankton, small fish, and piscivores and how such pattern will              
              respond to global climate change.  This will follow from his                   
              earlier work on dynamic state variable modeling.  The focus of                 
              the investigations will be on the resources of the California                  
              Current.  The empirical data on pelagic pattern will be used to                
              form the foundation of the models, estimate parameters of the                  
              models, and to provide data against which the models can be                    
              tested.
