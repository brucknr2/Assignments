Abstract    :
                   During the period of this Small Grant for Exploratory Research            
              award, the principal investigator will complete an initial                     
              investigation of the applicability of a unique mathematical                    
              technique based on the methods of stochastic state-space modeling              
              and Bayesian filtering to the prediction of protein structural                 
              class.  This research will complete a pilot study, which so far has            
              demonstrated that our approach is capable of correctly                         
              discriminating more than 80% of the time between predominantly all             
              alpha and predominantly all beta proteins.  In addition, it will               
              allow for a proper comparison with other methods, and a full                   
              statistical evaluation of the predicted classification sensitivity             
              and specificity.                                                               
                                                                                             
                   One of the fundamental problems in molecular biology is that              
              of relating a protein primary sequence to its function.  The                   
              function, whether structural or catalytic, is encoded in the                   
              protein's structure, often in the details of the three-dimensional             
              arrangement of amino-acid side chains on the surface.  The                     
              principal investigator is suggesting a method of prediction of                 
              protein structural classes from protein sequence data.  His method             
              employs stochastic modeling and Bayesian filtering.
