Abstract    :
              This award will support a research collaboration between                       
              Professor John Kincaid of SUNY-Stonybrook, Prof. E.G.D. Cohen                  
              of Rockefeller University, and Prof. Mariano Lopez de Haro of                  
              the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM).  The                       
              investigators intend to study transport properties of fluids                   
              and fluid mixtures.  The work will focus on methods to                         
              predict transport coefficients based on the revised Enskog                     
              theory, will develop a fundamentally new kinetic equation for                  
              dense fluids, and will investigate mass transport through                      
              porous media using the kinetic theory of lattice gases.                        
                                                                                             
              This collaboration will bring together experienced col-                        
              laborators with productive backgrounds in physical chemistry,                  
              theoretical physics, and engineering.  The work, while                         
              primarily theoretical, will involve numerical simulation of                    
              lattice gas models to be performed in Mexico.  The motivation                  
              for pursuing investigations in these areas is, in large part,                  
              due to the important role that transport properties play in                    
              current energy technologies, in particular, chemical process                   
              technologies, heat engine design, and especially petroleum                     
              technologies.
