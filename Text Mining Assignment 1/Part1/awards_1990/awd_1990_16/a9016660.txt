Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports a joint workshop between the U.S.                          
              and Argentina on fracture and welding.  The workshop will                      
              include 8 invited experts from the U.S., 4 from Argentina                      
              and 4 from other Latin American countries.  A large                            
              attendance is expected from government labs, universities                      
              and private companies from different Latin American                            
              countries.  The workshop will be held December 9-13,                           
              1991.  During the following week, December 16-20, the                          
              U.S. participants will be visiting other research                              
              facilities in Argentina:  INTEMA, Universidad de Mar del                       
              Plata; CONEA, several locations in Buenos Aires and                            
              Instituto Balseiro in Bariloche.  The U.S. participants                        
              include the co-organizers:  Dr. Hugo Ernst, Georgia Tech,                      
              Atlanta, GA, and Dr. John Landes, University of Tennessee,                     
              Knoxville, TN.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              M. Luis de Vedia of the Latin American Welding Foundation                      
              in Buenos Aires will be the Argentine co-organizer.  The                       
              main workshop theme is fracture and welding at both                            
              ambient and high temperature.  It will combine the                             
              latest work in fracture characterization and prediction                        
              and apply it to problems of welded structures.  This                           
              workshop will benefit all sides involved by bringing                           
              together experts in fracture and welding from the U.S.                         
              and several Latin American countries with the goal of                          
              developing future cooperative work.
