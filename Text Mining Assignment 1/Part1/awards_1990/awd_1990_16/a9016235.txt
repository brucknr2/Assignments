Abstract    :
                   This study will investigate a source mechanism generating                 
              ion acoustic wave turbulence in the topside ionosphere that can                
              cause strong backscatter radar echoes leading to false satellite               
              detection signals.  Theoretical investigation of the problem will              
              be conducted at MIT, while field experiments are planned at the                
              Arecibo Observatory to simulate the ionospheric conditions for                 
              the generations of ion acoustic wave turbulence.  The proposed                 
              source mechanism is a nonlinear mode coupling process whereby                  
              Langmuir waves induced by particle precipitation can interact                  
              nonlinearly to produce ion acoustic mode waves.  Detailed                      
              formulation of this nonlinear interaction process will be carried              
              out, incorporating realistic energy spectra of high particles                  
              with a numerical analysis.  In the simulation experiments at                   
              Arecibo, the VLF waves induced in the ionosphere by the HF                     
              heater are expected to cause the pitch angle scattering of                     
              originally trapped electrons in the radiation belts.  These                    
              suprathermal electrons precipitated into the ionosphere along the              
              earth's magnetic field will form a potential source producing                  
              large amplitude ion acoustic waves.  Both the 430 MHz and 50 MHz               
              radars will be employed to diagnose the ionoaphere over Aercibo.               
              The Aercibo experiments will be conducted primarily in the 1991                
              ionosphere heating campaign for the dedicated research program.
