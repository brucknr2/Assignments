Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Description:  This project supports collaborative research                     
              by Dr. Serge Timasheff of Brandeis University, Waltham, MA,                    
              and Dr. V. Prakash of the Central Food Technology Research                     
              Institute in Mysore, India.  The research is aimed at                          
              understanding the interaction between proteins and various                     
              ligands present in oil seeds such as sunflower, sesame,                        
              peanut, and cotton seeds.  The presence of these ligands                       
              prevents the full utilization of the proteins in these                         
              seeds.  In this research, isolation of high and low                            
              molecular weight proteins as well as isolation of                              
              constituant ligands will be completed.  A study will be made                   
              of the interactions of pairs of individual proteins and                        
              individual ligands, to determine the results under different                   
              reaction conditions, and to understand the nature of the                       
              binding site stoichiometry, geometry and reaction kinetics.                    
              Various biophysical techniques will be used in the study                       
              including spectropolarimetry, analytical                                       
              ultracentrifugation, fluoresence polarisation, affinity                        
              chromatography, and spectrophotometry.                                         
                                                                                             
              Scope:  This research brings together a well-established                       
              U.S. scientist and a highly productive young researcher from                   
              India to work on a problem of basic scientific interest in                     
              the biophysics and biochemistry areas.  In addition, this                      
              research has potentially significant benefits in improving                     
              the capabilities of many Less Developed Countries to meet                      
              their nutritional needs.  The two scientists will complement                   
              each others' work to enhance the expected research output.                     
              This project meets the objectives of the U.S.-India                            
              Cooperative Science Program.
