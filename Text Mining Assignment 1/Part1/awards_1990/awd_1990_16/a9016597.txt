Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Land degradation is occurring wherever land is cultivated and                  
              often undermines the productive capacity of ecosystems.                        
              Vegetative cover offers a simple, inexpensive, but under-utilized              
              technology which can be used to control erosion and prevent soil               
              degradation.  Its use in agricultural systems has been limited by              
              human and technical factors.  This project will develop a rapid                
              screening system for selection of tropical and temperate species               
              for use as vegetative covers in harsh environments.  Growth                    
              chambers will be used to simulate specific environmental                       
              conditions and characterize boundary conditions of temperature,                
              moisture and light for germination and early growth of selected                
              species.  Field tests at temperate and tropical field sites will               
              be used to evaluate growth chambers as prediction tools.  Socio-               
              cultural analyses will be conducted at a tropical field site to                
              enhance adoption and adaption of the technology and improve its                
              efficacy in restoring degraded lands.
