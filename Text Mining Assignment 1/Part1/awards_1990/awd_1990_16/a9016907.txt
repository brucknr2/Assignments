Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Theoretical research will be conducted on quantum spin glasses, the            
              finite connectivity spin glass and on self-organizing critical                 
              phenomena.  For quantum spin glasses investigations will be made of            
              the quantum Heisenberg spin glass in a field, the Potts spin glass             
              in a transverse field and the quantum spin glass on finite                     
              connectivity lattices.  For the finite connectivity spin glass we              
              will look at static and dynamic properties, patterns of replica                
              symmetry breaking and their stability, behavior of correlation                 
              functions and fluctuations, as a step toward understanding the                 
              short range model.  We will include small loops as a means to go               
              beyond the Bethe approximation toward behavior on a Bravais                    
              lattice.  We will also look at field theoretical models                        
              corresponding to non-equilibrium stationary states displaying self-            
              organized criticality for which cellular automata exist and at                 
              dynamical behavior of systems driven by an external field near                 
              their critical point.
