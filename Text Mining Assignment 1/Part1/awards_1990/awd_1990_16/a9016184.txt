Abstract    :
              This award will support Professor Lawrence Cerny of Utica                      
              College in a research collaboration with Professor Piero                       
              Foscolo of the University of L'Aquila, Italy.  The inves-                      
              tigators intend to carry out research in the area of particle                  
              and particle-fluid interactions in solid-liquid suspensions.                   
              Fluidization and sedimentation approaches will be combined                     
              using red blood cells as a novel source of particles.                          
                                                                                             
              One of the problems encountered in the testing of bed                          
              fluidization theories is the discrepancy occurring as the                      
              size of the bed particle is reduced to the micron level as                     
              well as when density differences between the particle and                      
              the fluid approach unity.  This has been recently addressed                    
              by the Italian research group.  To date they have been                         
              limited in these studies with spherical particles with a                       
              diameter of 1 mm and a density of 1.26 gm/ml.  By incorporating                
              the U.S. researcher's approach using erythrocytes, from                        
              either human or bovine blood, these investigations can be                      
              extended and provide a new model for particles with little or                  
              no interactions between them.
