Abstract    :
              This is a proposal for the acquisition of a high brilliance,                   
              rotating anode-based x-ray diffraction system for shared use by                
              The Ohio State University research groups in the Departments of                
              Chemistry and Physics.  The instrumentation of choice includes an              
              18kW rotating anode x-ray generator, a double mirror focusing                  
              system, a home-built camera capable of performing in both wide-                
              and low-angle modes, and a one-dimensional silicon diode array x-              
              ray detector.  The instrumentation will be shared among several                
              research groups for applications including: the kinetics and                   
              mechanism of biological liquid crystal phase transitions and thin              
              film characterization (Caffrey), structural characterization of                
              chiral thiophospholipids (Tsai), conducting polymers (Epstein),                
              zeolite synthesis in reverse micelles (Dutta), x-ray diffraction               
              studies of biological macromolecules (Sundaralingam), and elastic              
              properties of semiconductors under high pressure (Sooryakumar).                
              The instruments will not be operated on a service basis.  Rather,              
              regular users from each group will be trained for self-operation.              
              The system will be maintained and updated by the Department of                 
              Chemistry's instrumentation Support Groups.
