Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This grant supports the continuation of an observational program               
              to determine the distances (parallaxes), the absolute magnitudes,              
              and the proper motions of a select sample of relatively nearby                 
              stars.  The project has components based in both the Northern and              
              Southern Hemispheres with observations obtained from telescopes                
              located in Virginia and Australia.                                             
                                                                                             
              Data which are obtained from very precise measurements of the                  
              positions, the motions, and the brightnesses of nearby stars form              
              the basis for the cosmic distance scale used by astronomers.  The              
              long term astrometry program conducted by Drs. Ianna and Fredrick              
              at the University of Virginia provides an essential contribution               
              to this fundamental data base.
