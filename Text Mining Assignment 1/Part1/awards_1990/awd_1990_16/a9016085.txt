Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A one-day symposium will be held at the annual meeting of the                  
              American Society of Zoologist in San Antonio, Texas, in December               
              1990.  Animals are either oviparous (egg-laying) or viviparous                 
              (live-bearing).  Viviparity, often considered a characteristic of              
              mammals, has evolved independently in four of the five classes of              
              vertebrates, namely fishes, amphibian, reptiles, and mammals.                  
              Birds are the sole exception.  Evolutionary modification of the                
              embryonic developmental program an maternal reproductive physiology            
              facilitated the transition from oviparity to viviparity and form               
              the basis of the new maternal-embryonic relationships. As a group,             
              vertebrates offer unique opportunities for comparative and                     
              evolutionary studies of viviparity will be taken.  Interactions                
              among a diverse group is anticipated.  Proceedings of the symposium            
              will be published to provide a widely available reference for                  
              assessing progress in this developing field.
