Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A novel type of photosynthesis has recently been discovered in                 
              the submersed aquatic plant Hydrilla verticillata.                             
              Photosynthesis, the biochemical process by which plants transform              
              carbon dioxide and water into carbohydrate, has been shown to                  
              occur by two primary reaction sequences commonly designated as                 
              the C3 and C4 pathways.  All photosynthetic organisms utilize the              
              C3 pathway, however, a few, including corn and sugar cane, also                
              possess the C4 reaction sequence and are among the most                        
              productive plants known.  What makes Hydrilla unique is the                    
              ability of an individual plant to switch from C3 to C4                         
              photosynthesis depending upon environmental conditions.                        
                                                                                             
              This project will utilize a powerful combination of plant                      
              physiological and ecological methods in both greenhouse and field              
              studies to 1) quantify the environmental conditions associated                 
              with the C4 state in the field, 2) determine the environmental                 
              cues that induce the C4 state, 3) compare the photosynthetic and               
              productivity rates of C3 and C4 Hydrilla plants, 4) determine the              
              environmental conditions under which C4 photosynthesis benefits                
              growth, and 5) determine the importance of C4 photosynthesis to                
              the overall productivity of this plant.                                        
                                                                                             
              Hydrilla is native to tropical Africa and Asia.  It was                        
              introduced into Florida during the early 1960's by the aquarium                
              plant industry, and because of its prolific growth currently                   
              threatens freshwater resources throughout the southern United                  
              States.  Therefore, elucidation of its photosynthetic physiology               
              may contribute knowledge important for the control of this                     
              noxious weed.  Such knowledge may also facilitate breeding                     
              efforts to introduce desirable C4 traits into C3 crop plants and               
              possibly increase crop yield.  Furthermore, understanding the                  
              environmental conditions that induce C4 photosynthesis in this                 
              plant may give insights into the forces that resulted in the                   
              evolution of C4 photosynthesis in flowering plants.
