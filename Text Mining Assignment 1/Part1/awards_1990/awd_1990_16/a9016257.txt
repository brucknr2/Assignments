Abstract    :
              This award supports cooperative research in three                              
              areas of surface physics among several groups in the                           
              U.S. and in Brazil. The principal investigators are                            
              See-Chen Ying of Brown University and Amos Troper of                           
              the Brazilian Center for Physics Research (CBPF) in                            
              Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.  This work will be concerned                           
              with the growth and dynamics of mesoscopic and low                             
              dimensional systems.  It consists of three                                     
              interrelated projects:  (1) the growth and stability                           
              of interfaces, (2) the diffusive and vibrational                               
              motion of adatoms on surfaces, and (3) the optical                             
              properties of superlattices and quantum wells                                  
              with well-defined interfaces.  This project involves                           
              the effort of two institutions in the United States,                           
              Brown University and the Naval Research Laboratory, and                        
              two institutions in Brazil, CBPF and the National                              
              Institute for Space Research (INPE), with a total of                           
              three investigators on the Brazilian side and four                             
              on the American side.                                                          
                                                                                             
              Over the last few years a collaborative effort has                             
              already existed among the investigators.  The                                  
              present project would enhance further collaboration                            
              and allow a stronger focus and interaction among                               
              interrelated directions of research within the broad                           
              important area of surface and interface physics.
