Abstract    :
              Research will be conducted on variable rate tree-structured vector             
              quantizers for image compression applications.  The emphasis will              
              be on tree-structured codes designed using extensions and                      
              variations of the tree design techniques of Breiman, Friedman,                 
              Olshen  and Stone, but a variety of other vector quantization                  
              structures will be considered in combination with the tree-                    
              structured codes.  In particular, both finite state and predictive             
              vector quantizers will be considered for incorporating memory in               
              the coding and two-dimensional subsampling techniques will be                  
              considered as a means of increasing effective vector size,                     
              improving prediction accuracy and providing a natural data                     
              structure.  The dual use of trees for classification and                       
              compression in finite-state vector quantizers will be explored, as             
              will be the combination of compression of image sequences such as              
              video and multimodal images of a common object or view, as in                  
              multispectral and color imaging.  Experiments will be conducted                
              with medical images, computer image data consisting of mixed video,            
              imagery, and graphics, and satellite imagery, especially                       
              multispectral.
