Abstract    :
              This research is centered on the application of complex vector                 
              valued signal set-membership weighted recursive least squares (SM-             
              WRLS) algorithms to problems of current interest and the                       
              understanding of the basic operational principles of SM-WRLS with              
              regard to adaptation strategies, data selection criteria (optimal              
              and suboptimal) and computational efficiency.  Efficient                       
              computational algorithms which can ultimately be implemented using             
              systolic processing are also investigated.  Component tasks                    
              include: 1) neural network learning algorithms; 2) speech and image            
              coding, and 3) general developments and performance evaluation.
