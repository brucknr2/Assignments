Abstract    :
                   For the last two decades the emphasis in magnetospheric                   
              physics has been to understand what role the interplanetary                    
              magnetic field plays in determining the energy transfer from the               
              solar wind.  This emphasis has been justified because of the                   
              magnitude of the effect.  However, as a result, many of the                    
              factors governing geomagnetic activity have been overlooked.,                  
              This grant will look at several of these important factors                     
              including 1) the effects of solar wind dynamic pressure                        
              variations upon the magnetosphere, 2) the effects of solar wind                
              electric and magnetic fields upon the magnetosphere, and 3)                    
              predicting solar wind parameters from ground observations.
