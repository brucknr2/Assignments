              The Third Potsdam-Fifth Kiev Workshop, coorganized by                          
              Dr. David Kaup and Athanassios Fokas of Clarkson                               
              University with V. Zakharov of the Landau Institute of                         
              Theoretical Physics, Moscow, will provide an opportunity                       
              for US and Soviet scientists to discuss Mathematical                           
              Aspects of Integrable Nonlinear Equations, Inverse                             
              Problems in Physics, Nonlinear Optics, Turbulence,                             
              Plasmas and Collapse, Ionospheric Plasmas, Atmospheres                         
              and Oceans.  It will be held in Potsdam, NY August 1-11,                       
              1991.                                                                          
                                                                                             
              This meeting differs from previous meetings in this                            
              series in its emphasis on applications.  Most of the                           
              sections will be devoted to the application of                                 
              integrability, dynamical systems, and chaos to physical                        
              systems.  The intent is to bring together both scientists                      
              working in theory as well as applications to further                           
              enhance the applicability of various nonlinear models.                         
                                                                                             
              This project fulfills the program objective of advancing                       
              scientific knowledge by enabling leading researchers in                        
              the U.S. and U.S.S.R. to combine complementary efforts                         
              and capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and                        
              competence in the field of basic scientific research on                        
              the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of                           
              benefit.
