Abstract    :
              This award supports the establishment of a National Ice Core                   
              Curatorial Facility to be located on the grounds of the                        
              Denver Federal Center, operated as an extension of the U.S.                    
              Geological Survey's Core Research  Center (CRC) by the                         
              University of Colorado at Boulder and the U.S. Geological                      
              Survey.  The Facility will provide 50,600 cubic feet of                        
              safeguarded core storage at -35 degree celsius.                                
              Refrigerated examination room, holding, staging and changing                   
              areas will be provided as well as instruments and equipment                    
              for routine core examination and processing.  Additional                       
              facilities will be available at the Core Research Center.                      
              The Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research, University of                     
              Colorado will be responsible for the Facility, and will                        
              provide direction and communication with the scientific                        
              community.  The University will also provide a background of                   
              relevant research and educational activities that will                         
              enhance the Facility and provide new scientific                                
              opportunities.  The USGS will provide the physical                             
              facilities and staff, operate and maintain the Facility.                       
              The USGS will also act in a curatorial capacity, providing                     
              for the processing, cataloging, and distribution of samples-                   
              an area in which CRC personnel have over forty man-years of                    
              experience.
