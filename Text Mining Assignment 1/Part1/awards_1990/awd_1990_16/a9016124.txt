Abstract    :
                   This proposal is for funds to partially defray expenses                   
              for domestic transportation, subsistence, and proceedings                      
              publication for a Conference on Particle Production Near                       
              Threshold.  This conference is one in a series spanning 10                     
              years held nearby Indiana University and McCormack State Park.                 
              The meeting has direct importance to the planned research                      
              program at the Indiana University Cyclotron Facility.  This                    
              years conference deals with many forefront issues that will be                 
              attacked by the newly operational IUCF cooled beam facility and                
              by facilities under construction abroad, as well as some of the                
              existing nuclear and particle facilities.  Included among the                  
              subjects are threshold behavior of pion, kaon, eta, and charmed                
              meson production, as well as nucleon resonance and hyperon                     
              production.
