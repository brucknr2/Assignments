Abstract    :
                      Tree-ring chronologies provide one of the most important               
              records of past climate.  These records provide annual resolution              
              and unambiguous records of terrestrial climatological change.                  
              This research project will reconstruct the magnitude and                       
              frequency of drought in the northern Great Plains of North                     
              America for last three-hundred year interval of earth history.                 
              The geographic location for this study has been neglected in                   
              previous paloeclimate research.  Since it is an important                      
              agricultural region for the US, understanding the history of                   
              drought in this region is important for understanding future                   
              climate changes and their possible effect on food supplies.
