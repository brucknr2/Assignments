Abstract    :
              This award supports a visit by Dr. James D. Stasheff of the                    
              University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, to the University                   
              of Sydney, Australia, to work with Dr. Donald Barnes on                        
              cohomological methods in mathematical physics.  The researchers                
              will address problems in cohomological physics in terms of                     
              developing and applying techniques developed by Dr. Stasheff                   
              in his earlier research in combination with the relevant and                   
              complementary expertise of Dr. Barnes.  These techniques fall                  
              into two broad categories:  homological perturbation theory and                
              the study of higher order homotopy algebraic structure.                        
                                                                                             
              One approach to quantization is via a special kind of                          
              homological perturbation theory.  The terms in a perturbed                     
              differential can often be interpreted as higher order homotopy                 
              structure.  Dr. Stasheff identified a Lie algebra version of                   
              such structure in several different aspects of mathematical                    
              physics.  This project will further develop the formal theory                  
              of such "strong homotopy Lie algebras" and apply it to the                     
              physics.  The vast majority of examples of BRST cohomology in                  
              physics share the characteristic features of strongly homotopy                 
              Lie algebras.  This project will address the characterization                  
              of BRST cohomology along the characterization of spectral                      
              sequence constructors by Dr. Barnes.
