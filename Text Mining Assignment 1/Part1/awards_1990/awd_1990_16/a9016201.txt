Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will support collaborative research in polymers                     
              between Dr. Kenneth Shea, University of California, Irvine                     
              and three French scientists:  Drs. Alain Guyot and Andre                       
              Revillon, Laboratory for Organic Materials, French National                    
              Center for Scientific Research (CNRS), Vernaison, and Dr.                      
              Jean-Paul Chauvet, Ecole Normale Superieure, Lyons. The                        
              objective of the project is the development of new polymeric                   
              materials that can serve as heterogeneous catalysts for                        
              chemical reactions.                                                            
                                                                                             
              The program will feature a component of synthetic chemistry                    
              to prepare the network polymers and fluorescence and ESR                       
              studies to establish such features as:  the accessibility of                   
              the network polymers towards solvents, the penetrability                       
              towards reagents, the presence of heterogeneous domains, and                   
              the accessibility and mobility of polymer bound functional                     
              groups.  The project will benefit from the expertise of the                    
              CNRS group in the preparation of functionalized polymers and                   
              from the experience of the groups of Shea and Chavet in                        
              fluorescence spectroscopy and diagnostics.
