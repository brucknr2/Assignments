Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              O-stars play a crucial role in the energetics of galaxies and the              
              interstellar medium, but their formation and early evolution are               
              poorly understood.  Churchwell, a world leader in the study of                 
              these objects, will investigate the environments of newy formed O-             
              stars utilizing high-resolution radio and infrared techniques, to              
              develop models to understand the complex structure of the gas                  
              clouds from which these objects are formed.  The models will be                
              tested by their predictions of molecular and atomic lines which                
              would be observable in these clouds.  Kinematics distances and                 
              proper motions will also be obtained for some of these objects.
