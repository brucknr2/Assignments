Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The principal investigator continues investigations of                    
              time-dependent partial differential equations.  Typical                        
              applications are boundary-layer phenomena in fluid flow, and                   
              modeling atmospheric and oceanic phenomena.  The work                          
              concentrates on turbulent flows, problems with different time                  
              scales,  problems that are locally not well-posed.  It                         
              incorporates theoretical studies, numerical investigations,  and               
              the development of new computational algorithms.
