Abstract    :
                   Professor Blackadar will continue his work on a wide range                
              of problems concerning the structure of operator algebras and                  
              noncommutative algebraic topology.  Specific topics to be studied              
              are: (i) structure of inductive limits of homogeneous C*-                      
              algebras, (ii) nonstable K-theory and the fundamental                          
              comparability question, and (iii) existence and properties of                  
              cohomology theories on C*-algebras.                                            
                   The notion of a C* algebra is an abstraction of the idea of               
              a family of linear transformations on a space.  These                          
              transformations can also be thought of as having values in the                 
              states of the space, and the property of this family which is                  
              responsible for the symbol * is that the algebra is generated by               
              transformations whose values in these states are real numbers.                 
              The fact that these objects appear naturally in many branches of               
              mathematics and physics make them important to study.
