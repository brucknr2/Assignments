Abstract    :
              This award will support collaborative research by Professor                    
              James Press of the University of California at Riverside and                   
              Professor Ruben Klein of the National Laboratory for Scientific                
              Computation (LNCC) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.  The aim of the                  
              research is to study multivariate Bayesian classification                      
              methods in spatial statistics.                                                 
                                                                                             
              Image reconstruction and the contextual classification of                      
              remotely sensed data using iterative Bayesian and empirical                    
              Bayesian procedures will add an international dimension to this                
              collaboration.  The researchers, who have coauthored a number                  
              of journal articles on this topic, plan to extend existing                     
              models to broader contexts and to improve current models in                    
              various ways.  Both simulated and actual data will be studied.                 
              They propose to study "nugget effect" models, various spatial                  
              correlation structures, and adaptive starting value models                     
              using natural conjugate prior families (while using iterative                  
              procedures for predictive classification).  Results should be                  
              applicable to satellite imagery in agricultural and geophysical                
              contexts, image reconstruction, and problems in pattern                        
              recognition.
