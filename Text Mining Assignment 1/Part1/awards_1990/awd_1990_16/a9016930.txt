Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The research supported by this award is a collaborative effort at              
              Arizona State University, Dartmouth College, and the University of             
              North Carolina.  The three astronomers from these institutions                 
              involved in this project have been leaders in the discovery and                
              investigation of large scale deviations from uniform expansion in              
              the motion of nearby galaxies.  In this investigation they will                
              study the intrinsic properties of 500 elliptical galaxies to                   
              determine if their peculiar velocities, with respect to the general            
              expansion, can be related to the distribution of visible matter in             
              the regions under study.
