Abstract    :
              In a balanced code, each code word contains equal number of 1's and            
              0's. These codes find many applications - data transmission in                 
              fiber optics, data integrity maintenance in optical discs, fault               
              tolerant memory design etc.  The objective of this research is to              
              develop design methods for error correcting balanced codes.  The               
              aim is to design codes which have high information rate and at the             
              same time have simple encoding/decoding algorithms.  Other related             
              topics such as DC-free coset codes, balanced codes over higher                 
              alphabets, etc. are also being investigated.
