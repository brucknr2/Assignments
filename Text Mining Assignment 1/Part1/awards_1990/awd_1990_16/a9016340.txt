Abstract    :
                 The primary objectives of this research are to find decoding                
              algorithms for the Quadratic Residue (QR) Codes, including the well            
              known (23,12,7) Golay code, the (31,16,7) QR code and the (41,21,9)            
              code.  The key idea is to find the error locator polynomial by a               
              systematic use of the Newton identities associated with the code               
              syndromes.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              The study focusses on the binary QR codes which have length 8m+/-              
              1. The techniques developed extend the algebraic decoding algorithm            
              found recently by the PI for the (31,16,7) QR code and by Elia for             
              the (23,12,7) Golay code to more general QR codes.  The first new              
              example of this extension is the (41,21,9) QR code.  Is expected               
              that this work and the algebraic methods developed here can apply              
              generally to the entire set of QR codes and to other codes such as             
              the BCH and Reed-Solomon codes.
