Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal requests funds to augment our current NSF program                
              to establish and maintain a deep-water hydrographic station                    
              near Oahu, Hawaii as part of the Global Ocean Flux Study (GOFS)                
              program.  Our scientific objectives are:  (1) to observe and                   
              interpret the seasonal and interannual variability in the                      
              biology and chemistry of the mixed layer and the euphotic zone,                
              (2) to observe and interpret the seasonal and interannual                      
              variability in the rates of particle flux and apparent rates of                
              particle remineralization over the water column and (3) to                     
              understand the interrelationships between the processes                        
              mentioned in (1) and (2) above and the physical characteristics                
              of the water column.  Water column physical characteristics                    
              will be analyzed as part of the World Ocean Circulation                        
              Experiment (WOCE) during joint GOFS-WOCE cruises.  If                          
              successful, this augmentation request will support:  (1) a                     
              full-time data specialist who will be responsible for record                   
              keeping, quality control and distribution of data to the                       
              scientific community, (2) a half-time marine technician for                    
              additional field support of HOT program activities and to                      
              interface with other NSF grantees working at Station ALOHA.
