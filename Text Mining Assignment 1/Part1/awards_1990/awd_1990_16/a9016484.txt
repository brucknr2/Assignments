Abstract    :
              This Proposal requests partial funding for a vertical bore,                    
              intermediate field NMR spectrometer for high resolution                        
              spectroscopy in structural biology.  The instrument will consist               
              of a 7.05 T magnet, sufficient homogeneous volume for 10 mm                    
              proton and 20 mm heteronuclei sample tubes, and a console with                 
              all features necessary for advanced techniques such as proton                  
              detection of heteronuclei, spin locking, multiple quantum                      
              experiments, and all other modern two dimensional methods.                     
                                                                                             
              The spectrometer will be utilized by a core group of five Major                
              User (four with NSF funding) and several minor users.  The                     
              projects of the Major Users focus on NMR applications to                       
              structural biology.   Planned research using the proposed                      
              spectrometer emphasizes studies of biomolecule structure and                   
              model compounds of protein active sites, primarily on systems                  
              containing paramagnetic metal centers.  Each investigator has an               
              established program of NMR research with spectrometers of lesser               
              capability, and the Proposal documents the additional knowledge                
              to be gained by the new capabilities of the proposed instrument.               
                                                                                             
              The proposed instrument will come under the auspices of the UC                 
              Davis NMR Facility.  The Facility has a proven record of over ten              
              years in implementing state-of-the-art NMR techniques, and in                  
              spectrometer maintenance and modification.
