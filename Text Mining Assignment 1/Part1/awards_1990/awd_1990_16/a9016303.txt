Abstract    :
                   Fourier analysis is a flourishing and vibrant mathematical                
              field.  It is a core subject in mathematics because its central                
              purpose is to understand analysis on a geometric manifold and the              
              oscillatory behavior of phenomena characterizing the manifold.  The            
              direction and emphasis of much research over the past few years has            
              been placed on applications of ideas from Fourier analysis to other            
              areas of analysis, including applied mathematics, differential                 
              geometry, dynamical systems, mathematical physics, partial                     
              differential equations, probability and several complex variables.             
              New advances continue to be made in research aimed toward                      
              understanding basic problems related to maximal functions,                     
              multiplier operators and singular integrals which are at the heart             
              of Fourier analysis.                                                           
                   This grant will support a conference in Fourier Analysis to be            
              held May 13 -17, 1991 at Princeton University.  This conference                
              will draw leading analysts from all over the world, many who were              
              associated with developing the field.  Many young researchers will             
              also attend, and the conference should have a strong influence on              
              the research developments of the next generation of mathematicians.
