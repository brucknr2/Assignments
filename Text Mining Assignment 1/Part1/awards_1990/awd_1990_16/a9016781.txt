              This project is supported under NSF                                            
              Announcement No. 90-23 "Repair and                                             
              Rehabilitation Research for Seismic Resistance

              Pilot tests using bolts in slotted holes with                                  
              Belleville spring washers show an excellent                                    
              potential for energy dissipation during severe                                 
              cyclic loading due to slip between faying                                      
              plate surfaces.  Such tests indicate stable                                    
              repetitive hysteretic behavior during numerous                                 
              load reversals such as may occur during a                                      
              severe earthquake.  The slip at a connection                                   
              occurs at a slip-critical shear force on the                                   
              bolts.  Therefore it is possible to accurately                                 
              design braces and other elements such that                                     
              they would not buckle or yield under forces                                    
              caused by a seismic event.  This would                                         
              eliminate the most undesirable behavior                                        
              occurring in conventionally designed steel                                     
              bracing.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              In this project the earlier studies will be                                    
              extended to a larger range of bolt sizes and                                   
              types of cyclic loading.  The behavior of                                      
              several bolts at a connection under cyclic                                     
              loading will also be investigated.  After                                      
              analysis of these results, a model test frame                                  
              for experiments on the table will be designed.                                 
              Practical design procedures for energy                                         
              dissipating connections and the range of their                                 
              applicability will be developed by testing the                                 
              frames with simulated earthquake loadings.  It                                 
              is expected that the proposed system utilizing                                 
              conventional fabrication procedures will be                                    
              exceptionally cost effective for practical                                     
              applications.
