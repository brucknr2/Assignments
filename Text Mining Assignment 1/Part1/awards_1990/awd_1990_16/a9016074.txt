Abstract    :
              This proposal is for acquisition of an automated mass                          
              spectrometer system which can carry out nitrogen and carbon                    
              isotope analyses with a high throughput (about 100 samples per                 
              day) at moderate precision.  Both sample preparation and analyses              
              are automated in this system.  This instrument will be located in              
              a shared-use facility laboratory (Marine Science Institute                     
              Analytical Laboratory) which has a full-time professional                      
              supervisor.  This laboratory will maintain and operate the                     
              instrument on a recharge basis, including operator, at low cost                
              to the research projects.  Analyses from this equipment would be               
              available to researchers at other institutions as well as UCSB,                
              as is currently the case with the CHN elemental analyzer in this               
              facility.  The ability off this instrument to make large numbers               
              of analyses at low cost opens up the use of stable N and C                     
              isotopes for tracer studies in a variety of biological systems                 
              where such studies have either not been pursued previously or                  
              have been hampered by the high cost of analyses, lack of access                
              to facilities for such analyses, or the need for extensive sample              
              preparation.  The initial applications will be to investigate the              
              pathways of nitrogen uptake and utilization in symbionts, and to               
              study N inputs and fluxes in marine and freshwater systems.
