Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The matter of how energy dependent proteolysis regulates cellular              
              response to, and recovery from, stresses will be studied by                    
              examining the functions of specific proteins in Bacillus subtilis.             
              The "Lon" class of proteases will be studied using both genetic and            
              biochemical analyses of proteolytic activities that are                        
              characterized by ATP-dependent stimulation.  The regulatory aspects            
              of these proteases and the functions they regulate will be                     
              examined.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              The research planned is aimed at understanding how energy dependent            
              proteolysis functions in a cell's response to, and recovery from               
              environmentally imposed stresses.  Bacteria of the genus Bacillus              
              are the focus of the experimental undertakings.//
