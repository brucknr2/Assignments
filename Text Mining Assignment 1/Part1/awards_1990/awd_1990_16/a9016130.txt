Abstract    :
                   Research and development will be carried out towards                      
              producing a high efficiency neutron polarimeter based on wave                  
              shifting fibers imbedded in long plastic scintillators.  A                     
              hodoscope stack of such devices coupled to charge coupled                      
              devices or silicon photodiodes will provide tracking information               
              for recoiling protons from elastic neutron-proton scattering                   
              within the hydrogenous scintillator material.  Order of magnitude              
              increases in efficiency are possible over traditional double                   
              scatter methods (0.3% efficiency), with a much more compact and                
              versatile detector.  Such developments will be important for use               
              at high energy nuclear physics accelerators under construction                 
              because of diminishing cross sections with increasing energy.
