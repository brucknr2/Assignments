Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The detection of the signs of specific diseases in earlier human               
              populations is a long-standing goal of physical anthropology.  By              
              so doing one can better understand the factors affecting our                   
              ancestors and guiding their development and adaptation.  The                   
              demographics of earlier groups, the social and biological                      
              responses to disease and the like can be clarified with such                   
              information.  In the past, however, there has been much                        
              uncertainty in the identification of lesions on the skeleton                   
              caused by specific diseases.                                                   
                                                                                             
              Salo and Aufderheide will use DNA technology to test the ability               
              to identify specific pathogens in ancient human remains from the               
              New World.  They will attempt to identify the DNA of M.                        
              tuberculosis in the mummified remains of New World individuals                 
              who exhibit skeletal and soft tissue signs of the disease.                     
              Secondly, if the DNA of the pathogen is found, they will seek to               
              determine if it varies from contemporary M. tuberculosis.  This                
              may provide insight into the changes in the microbe over time.                 
              Tuberculosis is a good starting point as it has been established               
              in ancient mummies.  If successful, this technique should be                   
              extendable to other pathogens.
