Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The National Science Foundation and the State of Florida are                   
              providing funds to a consortium, consisting of Florida State                   
              University, The University of Florida, and Los Alamos National                 
              Laboratory, to establish a new National High Magnetic Field                    
              Laboratory.  The Florida/Los Alamos National Magnet Laboratory                 
              (FLNML) will be located at Florida State University, Tallahassee               
              and at Los Alamos National Laboratory.  FLNML will be a major                  
              user facility open to all qualified scientists and engineers.                  
              FLNML will develop a number of advanced high field magnets                     
              including a hybrid DC magnet with a design field capability of at              
              least 45T, a bore with a diameter of at last 32mm, and a 20MW                  
              low-ripple power supply, state-of-the-art superconducting magnets              
              for NMR in fields greater than 25T, intense pulsed field                       
              facilities capable of producing fields in excess of 75T for time               
              durations of msecs, and pulsed fields of 200T for microsec                     
              durations, and a variety of water-cooled magnets capable of the                
              production of fields up to 25T.  In addition, FLNML will have                  
              available a comprehensive range of instrumentation to carry out                
              experiments requiring these fields.  These magnets will be housed              
              in the Tallahassee facility, except for the pulsed field magnets               
              which will be located at Los Alamos.  The laboratory will also                 
              have a diverse in-house research and educational program                       
              involving faculty, post doctorals, and students from several                   
              disciplines including physics, chemistry, materials science,                   
              engineering, and biology.  Examples of research to be carried out              
              at the laboratory include high magnetic field studies of high                  
              temperature superconductors and high resolution NMR studies of                 
              the structure of complex biological molecules.
