Abstract    :
              Single crystal x-ray crystallography is the most powerful                      
              analytical method for structure determination of solids.  In                   
              synthetic inorganic, organic, bioinorganic and organmetallic                   
              chemistry, single crystal x-ray diffraction is an invaluable                   
              tool to characterize molecular structure.  The information                     
              gained from the knowledge of the molecular composition and                     
              structure helps to develop new reactions of potentially general                
              interest in catalysis or synthesis.                                            
                                                                                             
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program                 
              will help the Department of Chemistry at the University of                     
              Louisville acquire an upgrade of their computing facilities and                
              the x-ray diffraction laboratory.  Among the areas of chemical                 
              research that will enhance by the acquisition are the following:
