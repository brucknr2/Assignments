Abstract    :
              This research is concerned with the investigation of the atomic                
              structure of and crystal symmetry of (probe atom) surface bonding              
              sites produced during the epitaxial growth process.  The specific              
              surface sites will be on III-V epitaxial structures such as gallium            
              arsenide, indium-gallium arsenide, indium arsenide and indium                  
              phosphide grown on single crystal gallium arsenide substrates.                 
              Perturbed Angular Correlation (PAC) spectroscopy employing the                 
              indium/cadmium (isotope 111) probe will be used to measure electric            
              field gradients at the bonding sites via the nuclear electric                  
              quadrupole interaction.  The PAC technique can provide important               
              information about growth kinetics, thickness of layers,                        
              stoichiometry, and the crystal symmetry of the interface phases.
