Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research of Professor J. Harris                   
              to work in algebraic geometry.  He will work on the dimension                  
              of the parameter space of curves, the theory of branched                       
              covers, Hilbert functions of points in uniform position and                    
              an algebraic approach to the cohomology of moduli spaces.                      
                   The research is in the field of algebraic geometry, one                   
              of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which                       
              blossomed to the point where it has, in the past 10 years,                     
              solved problems that have stood for centuries.  Originally,                    
              it treated figures defined in the plane by the simplest of                     
              equations, namely polynomials.  Today, the field uses methods                  
              not only from algebra, but also from analysis and topology,                    
              and conversely it is extensively used in those fields.                         
              Moreover it has proved itself useful in fields as diverse as                   
              physics, theoretical computer science, cryptography, coding                    
              theory and robotics.
