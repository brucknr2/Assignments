Abstract    :
                   The scientific tasks of this project include modeling and                 
              data acquisition related to improving our understanding of large               
              scale plasma structures in the high latitude ionosphere.  The                  
              electrodynamics of auroral arcs will be studied using plasma line              
              measurements to be conducted using the Sondrestrom radar                       
              facility, which has been recently upgraded to facilitate such                  
              measurements.  Initial modeling efforts will be aimed at                       
              understanding the origin and complex evolution of polar cap                    
              patches and sun aligned arcs under north- and southward IMF                    
              conditions.  To provide realistic inputs for the modeling effort               
              and to provide a comparison for the output, data which the PI                  
              helped in acquiring as part of the CEDAR-organized HLPS (High-                 
              Latitude Plasma Structure) campaign will be used along with other              
              data from a variety of ground-based and in-situ sources.
