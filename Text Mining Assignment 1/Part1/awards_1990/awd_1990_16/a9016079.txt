Abstract    :
              The focus of our proposed research                                             
              is to investigate the surface                                                  
              reactions occurring during the                                                 
              growth of III-V semiconductors by

              mechanistic models for MOCVD have                                              
              been proposed that include                                                     
              numerous reactions steps and kinetic                                           
              parameters.  However, few studies                                              
              have been conducted to study the                                               
              reactions occurring at the surface                                             
              during the growth of III-V                                                     
              semiconductors.  In situ techniques                                            
              are available to characterize                                                  
              surface reactions but they are                                                 
              normally limited to study lower                                                
              temperatures and pressures than

              revolutionized our understanding                                               
              of catalytic reaction on solid

              semiconductors are no longer

              transmission techniques can not be                                             
              employed; indeed, these solids begin                                           
              to emit radiation. Fortunately, the                                            
              spectra of the emitted radiation can                                           
              be analyzed by similar techniques                                              
              and contains similar information

              spectroscopy may be an effective
