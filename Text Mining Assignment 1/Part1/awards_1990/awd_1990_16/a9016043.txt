Abstract    :
              This award will support collaborative research in algebra and                  
              number theory between Dr. Henri Gillet, University of                          
              Illinois at Chicago, and Dr. Christian Soule, Director of                      
              Research at the French National Center for Scientific                          
              Research and presently at the Institut des Hautes Etudes                       
              Scientifiques, Bures-sur-Yvette, France.                                       
                                                                                             
              Drs. Gillet and Soule propose to investigate the relationship                  
              between analytic and algebraic constructions which occur in                    
              arithmetic geometry.  In particular they will pursue the                       
              applications of their previous work on arithmetic intersection                 
              theory and the arithmetic Riemann-Roch theorem to problems in                  
              geometry and number theory.  Specific areas to be studied                      
              include the inequalities in Arakelov geometry, the Adelic                      
              Arakelov theory.  Dr. Gillet is one of the leading experts on                  
              the relationships between K-theory and algebraic geometry, as                  
              well as on the Arakelov theory.  This award will allow him to                  
              continue a highly fruitful collaboration with an outstanding                   
              French mathematician with complementary expertise.
