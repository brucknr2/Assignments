Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The major goal of this project is to develop a computer program to             
              model the cognitive processes involved in forming impressions of               
              candidates for political office.  The program will be a model of the           
              researchers' theory of cognition and evaluation and will account for           
              what information is attended to, how the information is stored in              
              memory and retrieved, and how available information is integrated into         
              a summary evaluation of candidates.  Current theories of voting make           
              unrealistic assumptions about cognition in candidate evaluation and do         
              not subject their assumptions to rigorous testing.  A large empirical          
              study by one of the researchers will provide the information on citizen        
              candidate evaluation that can be used in testing the theory about              
              cognition and candidate evaluation.
