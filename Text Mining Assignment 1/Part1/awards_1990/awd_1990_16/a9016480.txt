Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The University of Maryland Eastern Shore proposes to establish a               
              multi-faceted program designed to enhance the recruitment                      
              and preparation of high achieving minority students for                        
              marine science careers.  The program will build upon an                        
              innovative undergraduate marine science program including a) a                 
              B.S. degree in Environmental Science with an option in marine                  
              ecology, and b) an innovative 5-year BS/MS program in                          
              Environmental Science (Marine Ecology and Marine Science                       
              respectively.  The latter program is offered jointly by UMES and               
              the Horn Point Environmental Laboratory of the University of                   
              Maryland System.
