Abstract    :
                   This grant to the University of Notre Dame provides funds                 
              for replacement of the tandem Van de Graaff accelerator                        
              voltage grading resistors.  The new resistors will provide                     
              more linear voltage grading in the accelerator so that the                     
              acceleration tubes are subjected to more uniform electrostatic                 
              stress.
