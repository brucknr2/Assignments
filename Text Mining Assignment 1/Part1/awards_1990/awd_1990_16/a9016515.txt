Abstract    :
              Dr. Merritt, a leading expert on the dynamics of elliptical                    
              galaxies, proposes theoretical and numerical  studies of the                   
              structure and volution of these interesting objects.  An algorithm             
              will be developed to determine estimates of the mass distribution              
              of hot stellar systems based on line-of-sight velocity                         
              distributions.  Models both with and without spherical symmetry                
              will be subjected to numerical and analytical investigation to                 
              study their stability and reaction to bending perturbations.
