Abstract    :
              This project takes advantage of new developments in photography                
              and image analysis software to advance filed studies in                        
              environmental science.   The dynamics of ecological processes as               
              well as impacts from disturbance often are measured by changes in              
              vegetation.  Traditional methods of vegetation analysis are labor              
              intensive, slow, and as a result, they often are confined to                   
              small-scale measurement.  Many current research topics (i.e.                   
              climate change) require  analysis over large areas, and although               
              remote sensing from space is providing unprecedented information,              
              validation of satellite imagery with large-scale vegetation                    
              analysis is lacking.                                                           
                                                                                             
              A new, ground-based methodology has been developed by an                       
              interdisciplinary group at the University of New Mexico that is                
              significantly increasing the ability of scientists to study                    
              environmental dynamics across a range of scales and allow                      
              integration with reflectance measurements from satellite                       
              instruments.  The resulting system will provide a method of                    
              easily performing detailed analysis of near ground level images                
              on a computer workstation.//
