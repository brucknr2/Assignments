Abstract    :
                   The 10th International Conference on Spectral Line Shapes                 
              will be held at the University of Texas at Austin on June 24-                  
              29, 1990.  The conference emphasizes those physical processes                  
              associated with the formation of spectral line profiles as                     
              observed in the absorption, emission and scattering of light by                
              plasmas and neutral gases.
