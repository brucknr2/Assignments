Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Under the direction of Dr. Jeffrey Parsons, Mr. Marco Ribeiro                  
              will conduct archaeological field research to collect data for                 
              his doctoral dissertation.  Working in the Tumilaca drainage, a                
              tributary of the Osmore River in Southern Peru, he will conduct                
              excavations at four prehistoric sites which date to the Late                   
              Intermediate Period (ca. 1100 to 1480 AD).  The goal of his                    
              project is to understand changes in agricultural production in                 
              this prehistoric community over an extended period of time and to              
              examine the interaction between climate, long distance trade, and              
              social organization with this localized region.  Archaeological                
              evidence indicates that over time agricultural production first                
              intensified but that later terraces are abandoned.  Mr. Ribeiro                
              hypothesizes that inter-regional exchange induced surplus                      
              production while succeeding conditions of chronic drought led to               
              terrace abandonment.  His field program directly addresses the                 
              first of these issues, and excavation of a series of habitation                
              units in four settlements will provide data on both                            
              intensification of food production and the degree of regional                  
              exchange.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              This project is important for several reasons.  Not only will it               
              increase our understanding of the rise and decline of complex                  
              societies in Peru, but it should also provide information of                   
              direct agricultural use.  At one time many areas which today are               
              abandoned were employed in agricultural production.  The Tumilaca              
              terraces fall into this category, and if one can understand why                
              they were abandoned it should be possible to determine whether                 
              they might play a future productive role.  This project will also              
              assist in the training of a promising young scientist.
