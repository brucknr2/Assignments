Abstract    :
                   A rich, Triassic-age assemblage of apparent Gondwanan                     
              affinities has been discovered in the Richmond basin of Virginia.              
              PIs will study this assemblage towards three main goals: 1)                    
              clarification and documentation of the transition between the                  
              synapsid-dominated assemblages of the Middle to early Late                     
              Triassic and the archosaur-dominated asssemblages of the Late                  
              Triassic along with an analysis of the intimately related                      
              Carnian-Norian mass extinctions suggested by literature                        
              tabulations; 2) phylogenetic analysis of the new material                      
              focusing on eucynodont relationships and the early                             
              diversification of the lepidosauromorph diapsids; and 3)                       
              understanding the stratigraphic, sedimentologic and taphonomic                 
              context of the assemblage.  Because excavations so far have been               
              of limited extent and the results thus far so gratifying PIs                   
              anticipate the discovery of additional and more diverse material.
