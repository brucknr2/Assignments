Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Dr. Rosemary Wyse at the Johns Hopkins University will use this                
              award to continue her investigation of the present day kinematics              
              and distribution of chemical elements of the stars of our Milky Way            
              Galaxy.  Over 2000 stellar spectra have been obtained with support             
              from a prior NSF grant.  Observations will continue, but the                   
              emphasis will shift to the analysis of the large data set.                     
                                                                                             
              The study of galaxy formation is crucial to obtaining knowledge                
              about the physics of the origin of structure in the Universe.  An              
              understanding of our Milky Way Galaxy, for which the most detailed             
              data are available, is crucial for the development and testing of              
              theories of galaxy formation and for the elucidation of the origins            
              of different morphological types of galaxies.  The Milky Way offers            
              a unique opportunity for study since it is the only galaxy for                 
              which one can determine directly and in detail the true model-                 
              independent three-dimensional structure, kinematics and chemical               
              distributions of the constituent stellar populations, by study of              
              individual stars.  Dr. Wyse's theoretical modeling of her new                  
              observational results will provide new insight into the structure              
              and the course of the evolution of the Galaxy.
