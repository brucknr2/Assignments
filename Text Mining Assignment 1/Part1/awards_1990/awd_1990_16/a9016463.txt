Abstract    :
                   This grant will support a conference in representation                    
              theory of finite groups of Lie type.  The Lie theory is an area                
              where important strands from analysis, geometry, and algebra                   
              intersect.  The representation theory of the Lie-type groups is                
              typically more important in applications even than the theory of               
              their structure.                                                               
                   The conference will be held September 13-15, 1991 at the                  
              University of Oregon, which is a major center in Lie theory. The               
              participants will include the leaders in the field, both domestic              
              and foreign, and new ideas and progress in ongoing research                    
              activities will undoubtedly result.
