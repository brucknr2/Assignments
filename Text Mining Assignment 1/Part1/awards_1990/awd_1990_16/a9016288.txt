Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The volitional movement of ones limbs is commanded by electrical               
              activity in the neurons of the motor cortex, the output part of                
              the brain.  In quadriplegia, the spinal cord is damaged, but the               
              motor cortex is perfectly functional.  This array of electrodes,               
              implanted into motor cortex could be used to record the                        
              electrical activity of these neurons.  The electrode array could               
              then provide large numbers of signals which could control                      
              functional neuromuscular systems or external mechanical devices                
              (wheelchairs, artificial limbs, etc.).                                         
                                                                                             
              A three dimensional electrode array could be used in this                      
              application.  The array is constructed from monocrystaline                     
              silicon and contains 100 needle shaped electrodes which protrude               
              from a 4mm x 4mm substrate.  Each sharpened electrode is 1.5mm in              
              length and is about 80 microns in diameter at its base.  A                     
              modification of this silicon electrode array is used to conduct                
              a set of experiments in cats 1) to demonstrate that such an array              
              of electrodes is capable of recording cortical neural activity                 
              and 2) to optimize the electrical properties of the electrodes                 
              such that they can provide the greatest isolation of single unit               
              or unit cluster neural activity.
