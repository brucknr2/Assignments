Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Dr. McMillan will continue and expand his program of radial                    
              velocity measurements of solar-type stars to search for                        
              gravitational perturbations by planets.  Observations on this                  
              program began in 1985, and uniformly calibrated observations date              
              from late 1986.  Continuation of the observational project will                
              make the data series more sensitive to planetary perturbations.                
              More stars of near-solar type will be added to the observing list,             
              which will increase the statistical weight of the survey.                      
                                                                                             
              Information about the orbits and masses of planets orbiting stars              
              other than the Sun would broaden our perspective on the parameters             
              of our own Solar System and thereby help generalize and refine                 
              theories about the formation of stars and planetary systems.  Tests            
              have shown that Dr. McMillan's instrument has the stability and the            
              sensitivity to detect the reflex acceleration induced by a Jupiter-            
              mass planet on a solar type star, if the orbit of the planet has               
              a period less than 12 years and has a favorable inclination to our             
              line of sight.  At the current level of accuracy, this is the                  
              longest time base of all radial velocity programs in the United                
              States, and it provides the most observations of any such radial               
              velocity program in the world.
