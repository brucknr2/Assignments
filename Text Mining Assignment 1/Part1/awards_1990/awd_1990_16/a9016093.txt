Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will support collaborative research in physics                      
              between Dr. John Weiner, University of Maryland, and Dr.                       
              Francoise Masnou-Seeuws, Laboratory for Atomic and Molecular                   
              Collisions, Orsay, France.  The investigators propose a                        
              cooperative program in which experiments (on the US side) and                  
              theory (on the French side) will combine to advance understand-                
              ing of the dynamics of ultracold collisions in elementary                      
              processes.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              Dr. Weiner and his research group are currently carrying out                   
              experiments on associative ionization collisions in alkali                     
              atomic beams.  They have performed measurements of reaction                    
              probability as a function of collision velocity, excited-                      
              state alignment and orientation, and optical-field intensity                   
              over collision temperatures, ranging from several hundred                      
              degrees Kdown to less than 1 mK.  These results must be                        
              interpreted in terms of the very long-range behavior of                        
              potential curves at internuclear separations from several                      
              hundred to more than a thousand atomic units.  Furthermore,                    
              close coupling theories of inelastic collisions are indispen-                  
              sible to a proper description of the scattering event.  Dr.                    
              Masnous-Seeuws, a recognized world authority in these areas,                   
              and her theory group at Orsay, will apply their expertise to                   
              a thoroughgoing interprestation of the experimental results.                   
              The combined effort will lead to a clear understanding of                      
              chemical bond-forming mechanisms at ultracold temperatures.
