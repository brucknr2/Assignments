Abstract    :
              This proposal requests support for the 4th in a series of                      
              International Workshops on Mouse Genome Mapping to stimulate the               
              exchange, integration and distribution of genetic information among            
              scientists analyzing the mouse genome.  This meeting will assist               
              in the establishment of formalized working groups and committees               
              to insure the continuation of cooperative efforts for integrating              
              information and database development on an international basis.                
              The mapping and sequencing of the mouse genome is important because            
              of the large number of mutants and strains available for basic                 
              research in most areas of biology.***   //
