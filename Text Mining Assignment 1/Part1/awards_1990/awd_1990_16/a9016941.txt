Abstract    :
                   In order to properly understand the complex interactions of               
              charged particles in the earth's magnetosphere, it is important                
              to study the dynamics and configuration of the high-latitude                   
              polar region which is composed of the auroral zone and polar cap.              
              This grant focuses on studies of the polar magnetospheric using                
              low-altitude observations of precipitating particles and                       
              satellite auroral imagery.  Specifically, studies of the low-                  
              altitude cusp and signatures of the mantle will be undertaken in               
              order to answer questions of how low-altitude ionospheric                      
              processes can be used to remote sense distant magnetospheric                   
              phenomena.  This study is important to the Geospace Environment
