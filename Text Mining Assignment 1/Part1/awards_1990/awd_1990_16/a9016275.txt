Abstract    :
              NSF and the National Research council of Canada have reached an                
              agreement to interconnect Canada's newly.forming national                      
              research and academic network, "CA*net ( the asterisk represents               
              a Maple Leaf in its official logo) and the NSFNET with                         
              international links between three major nodes ("NSS's) on each                 
              network.  The NSS.NSS links will represent a "first" in the                    
              interconnection of international peer networks, inasmuch as                    
              CA*net and NSFNET both employ switching technology furnishid by                
              the IBM Corporation, and this eliminates the need to use devices               
              which adapt dissimilar technologies.  CA*net is fashioned on the               
              NSFNET model both in its technology and in its topolgy which                   
              connects regional/provincial networks in Canada.  The CA*net                   
              NSFNET interconnection will facilitate scientific and academic                 
              collaborations between the two countries.
