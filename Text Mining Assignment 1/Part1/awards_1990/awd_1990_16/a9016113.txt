Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is designed to introduce Alaskan Native                           
              undergraduate students to scientific study through marine                      
              internships.  The rationale is that the coastal Native                         
              populations of Alaska have a deep involvement with the marine                  
              environment, and especially with its biological resources.                     
              Marine science is therefore likely to be more attractive to                    
              them initially than other areas of science.  Students in their                 
              sophomore, or possibly freshman, year at selected coastal                      
              institutions, as well as the University of Alaska Fairbanks                    
              campuses, will be offered the opportunity to participate in                    
              marine science internships.  Working closely with a faculty                    
              mentor, each student will learn about research through hands-on                
              experience as well as individual tutoring.  Students at coastal                
              sites will be encouraged to move to a senior campus to pursue                  
              baccalaureate degrees in scientific areas, and those that chose                
              to do so would receive continued support and mentoring to                      
              encourage their success. Approximately five student fellowships                
              are to be offered each year of this three year project.
