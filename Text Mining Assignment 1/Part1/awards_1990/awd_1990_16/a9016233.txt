Abstract    :
              Funds are requested for an acquisition of the BetaScope 603                    
              Radioanalytic Imager to detect, record and analyze B-emmitting                 
              isotopes (32P, 35S, 14C) from any one or two dimensional samples               
              (gels, blots, TLC plates, etc.).  Research projects include                    
              studies of: 1) the biophysics of protein-nucleic acid                          
              interactions; 2) expression and regulation of eukaryotic and                   
              prokaryotic genetic material; 3) biology of episomes and                       
              transposable elements; 4) the biology and biochemistry of RNA                  
              processing in eukaryotes; 5) the biochemistry of ribozymes (i.e.,              
              Group I autocatalytic introns); 6) the biochemistry and genetic                
              of cholesterol and bile acid metabolism; 7) a new class of MHC                 
              linked genes and protein products; 8) factors directing the                    
              development of several classes of terminally differentiated                    
              mammalian cell.  A group of "minor users" studying a wide range                
              of biological problems is also described.
