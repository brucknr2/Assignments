Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              During the past three years the PIs have synthesized major                     
              element data from divergent and convergent plate margins into                  
              quantitative models of mantle melting that account for the                     
              global systematics in a tectonic context. While these models                   
              need to be tested, they provide a tool for understanding many                  
              related problems of petrogenesis. This project will examine the                
              global data base for ocean island basalts to test how well the                 
              major element melting models work in the tectonic setting of                   
              within-plate volcanism. In addition, the major element models                  
              will be extended to investigate the relationship between the                   
              major and trace elements
