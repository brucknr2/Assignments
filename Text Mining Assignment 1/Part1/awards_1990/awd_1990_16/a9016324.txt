Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The research will focus on the significance of canopy structure                
              for light interception and growth in seedlings of four fast-                   
              growing neotropical tree species with contrasting architectural                
              patterns.  The four species, Cecropia obtusifolia, Heliocarpus                 
              appendiculatus, Piper auritum, and Trema micrantha, present a                  
              spectrum of canopy architectures, from few large leaves born on a              
              single shoot to many small leaves born in a branched crown.                    
              Light interception of seedlings growing in the field will be                   
              estimated with computer simulations which combine measurements of              
              leaf display with hemispherical photographs of the canopy light                
              environment.  The light interception capacity will be correlated               
              with growth over an 18 month period.  This analysis will be                    
              complemented by a study of seedling growth in a controlled                     
              environment, in which relative growth rate is decomposed into                  
              three factors, the ambient light level, the amount of light                    
              intercepted, and the efficiency of light utilization.  Finally,                
              individuals of each species will be grown in spatially                         
              heterogeneous environments to evaluate the plasticity of                       
              architectural and morphological components of leaf display.  This              
              research will provide a quantitative analysis of the functional                
              significance of canopy architecture in relation to light                       
              interception and carbon gain.
