Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The investigators will study the phylogeny and geography of host               
              associations among populations of Papilio zelicaon (Lepidoptera)               
              that differ in the host plants they use in northwestern United                 
              States and southwestern Canada.  The proposed work will use the                
              broad range of umbelliferous species fed on by P. zelicaon to                  
              relate the intraspecific geographic patterns of host use to                    
              phylogeny.  Objective 1 of the proposed work will test for                     
              differences in oviposition preference and specificity among                    
              females from populations that are oligophagous.  The oviposition               
              preference and specificity trials will show the geographic                     
              pattern for variation in oviposition preference and specificity                
              among females tested.  Objective 2 will take advantage of                      
              molecular techniques to analyze mitochondrial DNA and allozyme                 
              variation and construct a phylogeny of host use the same                       
              populations used in objective 1.  In objective 3 the same                      
              techniques will be used to show the number of times a novel host               
              (fennel, Foeniculum vulgare) has been colonized, and the extent                
              to which fennel-feeding populations have diverged from native                  
              host populations.  Together, these 3 objectives will provide a                 
              better understanding of how phylogeny and geography interact to                
              produce regional patterns of host specificity in phytophagous                  
              insects.
