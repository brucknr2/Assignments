Abstract    :
              This U.S.-Venezuela award will support Professor Hal Caswell                   
              of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in a research                      
              collaboration with Professor Juan Silva of the Universidad de                  
              los Andes in Merida, Venezuela.  The investigators intend to                   
              study the way in which the environment, genetics, development,                 
              and life history interact to produce a set of vital rates                      
              (i.e., rates of survival, reproduction, growth, etc.).  By                     
              incorporating those rates into appropriate structured                          
              population models, mathematical analysis may be used to                        
              predict patterns of population dynamics and the sensitivity                    
              of those patterns to changes in the environment.                               
                                                                                             
              The researchers plan to collaborate by combining theoretical                   
              population models with an experimental program on tropical                     
              savanna plant populations.  The theoretical research will                      
              extend statistical tools for analyzing demographic experiments,                
              develop matrix models for interacting populations, and                         
              incorporate quantitative genetics into models of complex life                  
              histories.  The experimental research will address the                         
              comparative responses of annual and perennial savanna plants                   
              to environmental disturbance, competitive interactions among                   
              savanna grasses, the evolution of seed dormancy, and the way                   
              these factors combine to determine savanna community structure.                
              This approach to population dynamics is a most powerful                        
              approach to understanding community patterns, including                        
              diversity, stability, and coexistence.
