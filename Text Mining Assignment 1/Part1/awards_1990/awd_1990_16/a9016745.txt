Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is a workshop on Problems in Arctic                               
              Engineering to be held at the University of Alaska at                          
              fairbanks between U.S. and Soviet Engineers.  The principal                    
              theme of the workshop is the problem of engineering                            
              projects in a cold region which contains permafrost.  The                      
              results will be applicable to other cold regions of the                        
              country.
