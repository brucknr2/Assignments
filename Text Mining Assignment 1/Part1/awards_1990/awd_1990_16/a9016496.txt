Abstract    :
                   The project will investigate transverse flow and lateral                  
              spread in sheet rolling in order to improve our understanding of               
              the shape changes that occur in conventional sheet rolling.  The               
              aim is to formulate an analytical theory for shape rolling which               
              can be used to develop approximate models of three-dimensional                 
              sheet rolling that can be solved rapidly enough to be used in                  
              rolling mill control systems.                                                  
                   Although sheet metal is widely used by industry, it is very               
              difficult to produce highly uniform sheet metal with minimal                   
              defects.  In order to do so, sensing and control of the rolling                
              parameters is required.  Existing analysis techniques are too slow             
              and complex to be used at normal industrial production speeds.  The            
              work will develop a simplified but accurate analytical model which             
              can be effective in high speed rolling.
