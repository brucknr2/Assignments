Abstract    :
                   Recent discoveries of shocked feldspar and quartz near the                
              Triassic-Jurassic systemic boundary in Tuscany seem to provide the             
              stratigraphic record of the latest Triassic Manicouagan impact,                
              which created one of the five largest impact craters on Earth.                 
              This Manicouagan impact is of the magnitude necessary to generate              
              the large-scale global darkening, thermal variations, and other                
              environmental changes as proposed for another mass extinction at               
              the K-T boundary.                                                              
                   A quantitative paleoecological study of marine bivalves and               
              associated invertebrates across the T-J systemic boundary sections             
              in Tuscany will document the marine diversity record relative to               
              the Manicouagan event.  The paleobiological data will be collected             
              in conjunction with sampling for shock-metamorphosed minerals and              
              geochemical anomalies.  The objective of this exploratory study is             
              to calibrate the marine diversity record in the Tuscan sections                
              with the new evidence for the stratigraphic location of the                    
              Manicouagan event.
