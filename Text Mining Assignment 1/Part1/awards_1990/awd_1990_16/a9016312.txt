Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This grant will fund a special year in Ergodic Theory and                 
              Dynamical Systems to be held at the University of North Carolina               
              at Chapel Hill during the calendar year 1991.  Research activity               
              during the Special Year will concentrate on problems in countable              
              state Markov shifts, unusual ergodic theorems, and notions of                  
              orbit equivalence.  Three workshops are planned to bring together              
              experts in each of these areas for a short period of intense                   
              activity.  Interesting applications and related problems in                    
              smooth dynamics and ergodic theory will also be discussed.                     
                                                                                             
              The Department of Mathematics is funding three visiting positions              
              and this grant will fund partial expenses for a series of short                
              term visitors and workshop participants.
