Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                             
                  The goal of this project is to develop and explore a new                  
              conception of the phonological component in generative grammar.                
              On this view, the basic universal principles of phonology measure              
              the well-formedness of phonological representations; individual                
              grammars are constructed by weighting the universal principles                 
              and computing their interaction via the principles of Harmony                  
              Theory.  The representation assigned to a given form is that                   
              which rates most highly in the harmony-theoretic combination of                
              well-formedness along its various dimensions of phonological                   
              organization; that which optimally satisfies the various                       
              (sometimes contradictory) constraints placed upon it.                          
                                                                                             
                   The approach promises to anchor phonology directly upon a                 
              set of universal principles, a goal which has proved elusive in                
              standard generative phonology.  The key is replacing the familiar              
              derivational, rule-based computational format with one directly                
              based upon the idea of optimization.                                           
                                                                                             
                   The main object of study will be systems of stress and                    
              syllable structure.
