Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              The goal of this project is to explore the heritable components                
              of social behavior.  Some heritability estimates have been                     
              reported on a number of$attitude items.  A series of studies will              
              be undertaken on the heritability of social influence, attitude                
              correlates, and personality.                                                   
                                                                                             
              This approach extends the current trend in social psychological                
              research to investigate the biological and physiological                       
              correlates of social behavior.                                                 
                                                                                             
              The main question to be addressed by this research is whether the              
              heritability of attitudes is correlated with other known attitude              
              parameters.
