Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The goals of the proposed study are: first, to measure components              
              of lifetime reproductive success (LRS) for individual male                     
              baboons, to attribute variance in LRS to the different components              
              of LRS, and to identify particular traits of individuals as the                
              sources of this variance.  Second, to test the following                       
              hypotheses: (i) likelihood that a male baboon will disperse from               
              groups in which he has female relatives is a function of the                   
              costs of dispersal and the benefits of avoiding inbreeding                     
              depression, (ii) males decrease mortality costs associated with                
              dispersal by altering dispersal patterns, and (iii) males                      
              increase fecundity by altering dispersal patterns.                             
                                                                                             
              The subjects are wild male baboons (Papio cycynocephalus) in                   
              Amboseli National Park, Kenya.  Their life histories and dispersal             
              patterns are being investigated in two ways, through a detailed                
              cross-sectional behavioral study and through analysis of long-term             
              demographic data.  From these two types of data components of LRS              
              will be estimated.
