Abstract    :
              This proposal represents a continuation of research on the                     
              fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE), which started as a NSF                  
              Industry-University Cooperation Research Activity and involved a               
              collaboration with Dr. H. L. Stormer of AT&T Bell Labs.  The                   
              proposed research represents a continuation of the FQHE effort                 
              and will be concentrated in three areas, namely 1) the nature of               
              the ground state, 2) low energy excitations, and 3) the                        
              transition to a Wigner solid.  This research team has made many                
              of the significant discoveries in recent years in this subfield                
              and in the last 3-year period observed the even denominator                    
              state, the small filling factor termination of the FQHE series,                
              the scaling behavior of the QHE, and obtained important new                    
              information on the quasi-particle gaps.
