Abstract    :
                   A technique for measuring and interpreting collisional                    
              parameters as a function of applied electric fields provides, in               
              effect, a direct measurement of the density matrix and, hence, a               
              result connecting very directly to theoretical models.  This                   
              method is applied to H+ on He collisions in the 20 to 100 keV                  
              range resulting in electron transfer to produce H (n=2); and to                
              electron detachment from the negative ion H- (n=2) and H(n=3).
