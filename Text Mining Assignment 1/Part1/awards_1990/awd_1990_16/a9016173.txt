Abstract    :
              The objective of this Small Grants for Exploratory                             
              Research (SGER) is to initiate the development of                              
              new methods to analyze and solve engineering                                   
              problems using computer mathematical systems such                              
              as MATHEMATICA for the computer extension and                                  
              analysis of perturbation series.  These methods will                           
              be applied to problems in fluid-structural interaction.                        
              On of the main problems to be tested will be the                               
              motion of red blood cells which is a well known but                            
              difficult to solve free boundaries are encountered, e.g.                       
              phase transition during crystal growth and convection                          
              induced mass transport.
