Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A 1-2.5 micron wavelength imaging system will be constructed to                
              carry out two major research programs:  a study of the morphology              
              and stellar content of galaxies and a determination of the                     
              stellar initial mass function in regions of star formation with a              
              wide range of physical characteristics.  The instrument will be                
              based on a Rockwell 256 x 256 HgCdTe array and be used on the                  
              Ohio State/Lowell Observatory 1.8-m telescope in Flagstaff,                    
              Arizona.  A plate scale of 1.6 arcsec per pixel and a grism with               
              a resolving power of 240 will give the instrument two unique                   
              characteristics:  a large - 7 arcmin - field of view combined                  
              with high quantum efficiency (QE), and a slit length of equal                  
              size for low resolution spectroscopy.  These characteristics                   
              combined with the availability of long blocks of observing time,               
              will allow the researchers at Ohio State to carry out large scale              
              survey programs to a level of sensitivity that would be otherwise              
              impossible.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              The first of the two major undertakings will be the compilation                
              of a multi-color near infrared (IR) atlas of normal galaxies of                
              all types.  The near IR light, which closely tracks the mass                   
              distribution, is expected to reveal structures not visible                     
              optically.  The study of dark clouds and regions of star                       
              formation represents the first time a complete survey over a                   
              range of cloud masses will be obtained and will establish, for                 
              example, how the stellar initial mass function varies with                     
              environment.
