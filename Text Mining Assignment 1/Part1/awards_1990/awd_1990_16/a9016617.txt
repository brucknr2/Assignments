Abstract    :
              A three-year research program is                                               
              awarded to develop monolithically                                              
              integrated polarization-modulated                                              
              lasers that can be modulated to                                                
              ultra-high-frequencies and coupled                                             
              lasers that can function as optical                                            
              bistable elements for use as                                                   
              switches, memories, and logic                                                  
              circuits.  A unique feature and                                                
              basic theme of the proposed program                                            
              is that the device concepts are                                                
              tested and evaluated in the context                                            
              of a fabrication approach that is                                              
              suitable for large scale integration
