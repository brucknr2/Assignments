Abstract    :
              This award will support collaboration in quantum field theory                  
              between a physics research group at the University of                          
              Pittsburgh led by Daniel Boyanovsky, and a group at the                        
              Pontificia Universidade Catolica in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil,                    
              led by Carlos Aragao de Carvalho.  Based on a conjecture                       
              that a recently fixed point theory describes the critical                      
              properties of thin film layers of superfluid HeII in a                         
              substrate potential, the project aims to study with pertur-                    
              bative and non-perturbative techniques both the renormalizable                 
              and the superrenormalizable regime in statistical mechanics                    
              theories in which both order and disorder operators are                        
              present.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              The research is designed to lead to an understanding of the                    
              renormalization aspects of theories in higher dimensions in                    
              which topological excitations play a leading role in describing                
              the dynamics.  The project involves topics in quantum field                    
              theory that are of common interest to both the U.S. group and                  
              the Brazilian group, and in which the collaborators in both                    
              groups have experience.  The joint project will enable the                     
              two groups to combine their expertise and expedite the                         
              research results.
