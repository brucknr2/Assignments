Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Introductory physics teaching has tended to treat relativity theory and        
              quantum mechanics as though they were totally disconnected from the rest       
                                                                                             
              of the field.  This project seeks to modify the traditional curriculum         
              by concentrating on those fundamental concepts that link classical and         
              twentieth-century physics, thereby bridging the gap between them,              
              demystifying the latter and making both more accessible to the beginning       
                                                                                             
              student.  Building on recent results from cognitive science research,          
              the project will use technology in two complementary ways:  (1)  to            
              create sophisticated yet inexpensive experiments capable of                    
              demonstrating some of the relevant physical effects and principles, and        
              (2)  to build powerful computer-based environments within which students       
                                                                                             
              will design their own simulated experiments that go far beyond what can        
              be achieved in the laboratory.  The computer tools will enable students        
              not only to model purely classical systems but, by varying parameters,         
              to pass continuously from the classical to the relativistic or quantum         
              regimes.  Students will thus be able to investigate effects that are           
              observable only at high speeds or small scales, displaying them in             
              multiple representations from any frame of reference.  In collaboration        
                                                                                             
              with high school and undergraduate teachers, we will create curriculum         
                                                                                             
              materials to make our software and experiments applicable to physics           
                                                                                             
              courses at many different levels.
