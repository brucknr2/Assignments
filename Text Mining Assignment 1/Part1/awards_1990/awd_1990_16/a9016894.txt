Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              .                                                                              
              J                                                                              
              H.Laboratory experiments will be performed to determine if and                 
              how trivalent REE are fractionated during their geochemical                    
              interactions in waters and sediments.  Field data have shown                   
              that fractionation occurs during weathering and soil                           
              development, during early diagenesis of redox.reactive marine                  
              sediments and in the water column of marine and estuarine                      
              basins with oxic/anoxic boundaries.  Little is known about the                 
              reactions and chemical factors which govern fractionation of                   
              trivalent REE.  Fractionation, in turn, is a unique                            
              characteristic of REE series and forms the basis for                           
              understanding geochemical cycling of these important elements.                 
                                                                                             
              Emphasis will be placed on developing laboratory simulation of                 
              natural processes at natural concentrations of solution and                    
              solid phases.  Radioactive isotopes of REE will be used as                     
              tracers for the different reactions.
