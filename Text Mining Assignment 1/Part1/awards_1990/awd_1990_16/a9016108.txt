Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Preliminary examination of a long model run of the NCAR CCM               
              with idealized geography indicates that the surface temperature                
              field can be interpreted as an system forced by noise in space-                
              time.  The linear system can be interpreted as an energy-balance               
              climate model (EBM) with diffusive horizontal heat transport and               
              linear radiation damping.                                                      
                                                                                             
                   The surface temperature field in both models has several                  
              interesting properties.  For example, the spatial correlation                  
              statistics are essentially isotropic over distances of a few                   
              thousand km.  The spatial correlations fall off with a                         
              characteristic length of about 1500 km which agrees with the EBM               
              and with surface temperature data. Linear theory suggests that                 
              climatological (=time averaged) responses to point heat sources                
              should exhibit a spatial pattern identical to the equal times                  
              spatial auto correlation function.  This appears to be the case                
              in the CCM surface data.  These pieces of evidence help to                     
              explain why the EBM has been so successful in earlier studies of               
              the seasonal cycle and even in various paleoclimate scenarios                  
              compared to data and GCMs.  This research will study the                       
              underlying mechanisms of climate variability and change using                  
              simple models.  The PI will systematically examine the fluxes and              
              related meteorological fields in order to clarify the reasons for              
              the apparant linearity of climate fluctuation and response                     
              phenomena.  This research is important because it may give                     
              insight into how the climate system works - a pre-requisite for                
              more credible predictions of future climates.
