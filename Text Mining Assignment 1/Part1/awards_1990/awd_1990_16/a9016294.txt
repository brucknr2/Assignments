Abstract    :
              A three-week workshop, involving about 20 residents at any one                 
              time, will discuss current needs and future strategies for                     
              developing the ability to identify and predict the presence of                 
              complex functional units on sequenced, but otherwise                           
              uncharacterized, genomic DNA.  This focus will address the need                
              for computation-based, automatic tools for synthesizing available              
              data about individual consensus sequences and local compositional              
              patterns into the composite objects (e.g., genes) that are -- as               
              composite entities -- the true objects of interest when scanning               
              DNA sequences.  The workshop has been structured to promote                    
              sustained informal contact and exchange of expertise between                   
              molecular biologists, computer scientists,and mathematicians.  No              
              participant will stay for less than one week, and most will attend             
              for two-three weeks.  Computers, software, and databases will be               
              available for use as "electronic blackboards."
