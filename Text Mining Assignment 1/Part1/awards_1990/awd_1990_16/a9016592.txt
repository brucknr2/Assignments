Abstract    :
              This is a joint award with Dr. Vijayshanker at the University of               
              Delaware.  This team has proposed several major research  tasks                
              in natural language processing with special emphasis on  several               
              mathematical and computational aspects.  The work clearly has a                
              formal and mathematical character.  The various  computational                 
              structures and strategies the team has developed and will                      
              develop, need to be investigated mathematically because such                   
              investigations shed light on the descriptive and processing                    
              powers of these formalisms.  These two aspects, i.e., the                      
              development of the structures and strategies, and their                        
              mathematical investigations, are very much interrelated.  It is                
              believed that natural language processing backed up by a formal                
              framework, and mathematical investigations grounded in empirical               
              studies are two very productive areas of research.  The                        
              researcher will focus on interested in mathematical                            
              investigations only to the extent to which the results have                    
              important implications for natural language processing.
