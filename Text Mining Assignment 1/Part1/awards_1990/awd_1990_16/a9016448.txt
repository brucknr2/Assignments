Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The purpose of this research is to determine the net                           
              biologically produced oxygen flux and extent of nutrient                       
              recycling in the surface waters of the ocean using the                         
              concentrations of oxygen, argon, nitrogen and the &180 of                      
              molecular 02.  These tracers will be sampled monthly for one                   
              year at the JGOFS time-series station near Hawaii and                          
              incubation methods will be developed for determining the                       
              community respiration rate and respiration isotope                             
              fractionation factor.  These studies will take advantage of the                
              high level of precision that has been developed so far in Dr.                  
              Emerson's upper ocean research.  Measurements from the                         
              subarctic Pacific during the summers of 1987 and 1988 indicated                
              that the net biological oxygen production determined by his                    
              methods agree with summertime dissolved and particulate nitrogen               
              mass balances.  The &180-02 measured in surface ocean suggested a              
              new production ratio of 0.2 which is in accordance with the new                
              production estimated derived from gas concentrations and 14C                   
              incubation estimates of primary production.  The respiration                   
              isotope fractionation factor in the upper thermocline appears                  
              to be 6-7% less than that observed in the euphotic zone.                       
              Preliminary results at the JGOFS time-series station suggest                   
              similar isotope trends.
