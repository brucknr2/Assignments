Abstract    :
                   Experimental studies in laboratory animals have demonstrated              
              that bony morphology responds ontogenetically to behavioral                    
              modification.  The scapula, in particular, has been shown to be                
              very plastic during growth.  Locomotor behavior often changes                  
              with increase in body size, and it is well known that locomotor                
              behavior of the gorilla changes with ontogeny.  Thus, this study               
              is designed to investigate ontogenetic shape change in the                     
              scapula of two subspecies of gorilla, the largest extant primate.              
                   Scapular shape will be assessed both by traditional linear                
              measurements and by shape indices.  Nearly 400 scapulae from                   
              several museums will be studied.  Tensor biometrics will also be               
              used to assess scapular shape independent of size, and                         
              multivariate tests will be used to test for differences between                
              male and female and for age-related differences.  The results of               
              this comparative study will be useful for making predictions                   
              about locomotor behavior which can then be tested in the wild.
