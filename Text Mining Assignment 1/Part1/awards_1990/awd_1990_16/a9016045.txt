Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will support collaborative research between Dr.                     
              Mark Glauser, Clarkson University and two French scientists:                   
              Dr. Jean-Paul Bonnet and Dr. Joel Delville, both from the                      
              Laboratory for Aerodynamic Studies, University of Poitiers,                    
              France.  The object of the project is to investigate  the                      
              role that coherent structures play in practical turbulent                      
              flows, a topic of great interest and importance to the                         
              aerospace industry.                                                            
                                                                                             
              The investigators will examine coherent structures in five                     
              different shear layers, using all or part of the following                     
              techniques:  pseudo-flow visualization, proper orthagonal                      
              decomposition (POD) and dynamical systems theory.  The five                    
              flows are:  the plane mixing layer, the lobed mixer (a                         
              device used to generate streamwise vorticity), the axisymmetric                
              jet mixing layer, the separated flow in an axisymmetric                        
              sudden expansion, and a supersonic wake.  The French research                  
              group will provide a significant contribution to this effort,                  
              since they have studied the plane shear layer extensively and                  
              are knowledgeable in the application of the pseudo flow                        
              visualization technique.  In addition, the University of                       
              Poitiers has unique facilities for the study of supersonic                     
              flow .
