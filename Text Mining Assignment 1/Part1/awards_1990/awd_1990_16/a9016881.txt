Abstract    :
              With this award, the Synthetic Organic Program will support the                
              research of Dr. William G. Dauben of the Department of                         
              Chemistry at the University of California, Berkeley.  The                      
              proposed research seeks to probe the effects of either high                    
              pressure or sonication on hindered substrates in reactions run                 
              under mild thermal conditions.                                                 
                                                                                             
              In the area of high pressure chemistry, Dr. Dauben will probe                  
              the development of charge in the transition state and the                      
              effects of stoichiometric ratios of reactants on the rates of                  
              reactions run at 15 kbar.  Acid catalyzed reactions, bioorganic                
              transformations and enolate conjugate additions will be                        
              included among the target reactions to be studied.  In the area                
              of sonochemistry, the focus will be on evaluating rate                         
              enhancement by sonication of homogeneous reactions that have                   
              previously been studied under controlled pressure conditions.                  
              This comparison will help to elucidate the source of exalted                   
              reaction rates under aegis of sonication.
