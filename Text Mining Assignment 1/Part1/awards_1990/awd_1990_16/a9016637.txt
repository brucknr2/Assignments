Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a two year collaborative project between Gary Maciel                   
              of Colorado State University and Ye Chaohui of the Wuhan                       
              Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.  It is                      
              sponsored jointly by NSF and the Chinese Academy of Sciences.                  
                                                                                             
              Research will focus on the continued development and                           
              application of dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP), a powerful                  
              electron.spin/nuclear.spin double.resonance technique that                     
              enhances the nuclear spin polarization in Nuclear Magnetic                     
              Resonance (NMR) experiments on materials containing both                       
              magnetic nuclei and unpaired electrons.  DNP is especially                     
              important in the characterization of Chinese and U.S. coals                    
              and diamond.like carbon films prepared in Chinese and U.S.                     
              laboratories.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              For the coal studies, the striking differences between                         
              magnetic resonance properties measured for U.S. and certain                    
              Chinese coals will be examined in depth, and structural                        
              models will be explored for explaining both types of coals                     
              and these specific differences.  In the diamond film studies,                  
              the nature of "defect" structures will be elucidated and                       
              related to film properties and preparation methods.  The                       
              unusual field strength used in the 1.9 T DNP spectrometer in                   
              the Wuhan Institute of Physics will provide a good opportunity                 
              for elucidating fundamental details of the DNP phenomenon in                   
              these samples (via the field dependence of DNP properties)                     
              and for establishing the optimum magnetic field for DNP                        
              studies of typical carbonaceous solids.
