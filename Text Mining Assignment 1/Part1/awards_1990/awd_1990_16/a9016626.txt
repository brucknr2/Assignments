Abstract    :
              This proposal seeks to make two advances in the dynamics of elasto-            
              plastic structural mechanics:  (1) to extend new methods of                    
              nonlinear dynamics and chaos to the fields of inelastic structural             
              mechanics, especially using new experimental techniques such as                
              Poincare maps and fractal mathematics, as well as explore spatial-             
              temporal chaos in some applications of solid mechanics.  (2) To                
              develop radically new computational tools for analysis of nonlinear            
              vibrations by inventing a way to put the computation on a chip                 
              using nonlinear cellular networks, as well as using both existing              
              supercomputers.
