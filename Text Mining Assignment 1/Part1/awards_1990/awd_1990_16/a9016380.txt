              Perception of Natural Disasters will take                                      
              place in Perugia, Italy, on November 1990.

              Reduction.  The purpose of the meeting is to                                   
              determine the areas of research of common                                      
              interest to the United States and other                                        
              nations suffering from the consequences of                                     
              persistent natural disasters, in the field of                                  
              prediction and in the area of public                                           
              perception.  Physical scientists, engineers                                    
              and social scientists from several countries                                   
              will discuss the state-of-the-art of                                           
              methodologies for the prediction of various                                    
              natural hazards and for the identification and                                 
              evaluation of factors influencing the                                          
              perception of existing capabilities.                                           
              Determining  which are the gaps in knowledge                                   
              and the needed research in these fields will                                   
              improve our capabilities for warning and                                       
              protecting populations at risk within diverse
