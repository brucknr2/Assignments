Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary objective of this U.S.-Hungary mathematics                         
              research project between Dr. Stephen BLoom of the Stevens                      
              Institute of Technology and Dr. Zoltan Esik of the Bolyai                      
              Institute, Szeged, is to study special classes of iteration                    
              theories that pertain to three areas:  algebraic automata                      
              theory, program correctness and sematics of concurrent                         
              processes.  In particular efforts will address matrix and                      
              matricial iteration theories and the theory of                                 
              synchronization trees.  These efforts should yield new                         
              knowledge of equational properties of formal power series                      
              and a new treatment of total correctness.  Collectively the                    
              results are expected to help unify a body of work in                           
              theoretical computer science, expressed inside a framework                     
              of iteration theories.                                                         
                                                                                             
              This project in computational theory fulfills the program                      
              objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling                        
              leading experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to                     
              combine complementary talents and share research resources                     
              in areas of strong mutual interests and competence.
