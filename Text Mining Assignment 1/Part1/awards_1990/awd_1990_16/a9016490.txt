Abstract    :
              With this grant in the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry                 
              Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Schatz will                       
              develop new theoretical and computational methods for                          
              describing unimolecular and bimolecular  reactions and other                   
              collision processes in the gas phase. The research will lead to                
              a deeper understanding of the mechanism and rate of these                      
              important chemical reactions.                                                  
                                                                                             
              The following areas will be investigated: (1) quantum                          
              mechanical methods for describing atom-diatom bimolecular                      
              reactions and dissociative photoprocesses, (2) classical and                   
              quantum methods for studying collisional relaxation of highly                  
              excited molecules by other molecules, and (3) quasiclassical                   
              methods for simulating state to state dynamics in chemical                     
              reactions involving triatomic and larger molecules.
