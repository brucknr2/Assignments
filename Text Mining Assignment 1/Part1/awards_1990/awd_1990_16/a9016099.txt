Abstract    :
              The proposal is for the acquisition of a scanning confocal                     
              microscope (SCM).  Various new software applications allow image               
              planes to be individually collected, stored and recombined to                  
              produce three-dimensional views of structures.  This ability to                
              spatially resolve structures within a sample is unique to SCMs                 
              and is one of the major advantages that they offer over                        
              traditional methods of data acquisition (standard                              
              immunofluorescence, transmission and scanning electron                         
              microscopy, DIC microscopy, etc.).  The instrument will be                     
              operated and maintained at the Center for Advanced                             
              Ultrastructural Research the SCM and will be easily accessible to              
              researchers at the University of Georgia and the Medical College               
              of Georgia, Augusta.  These researchers represent a variety of                 
              disciplines including agronomy, biochemistry, botany, chemistry,               
              entomology, genetics, microbiology, physiology, plant pathology,               
              and zoology, and the projects cover a broad range of cytological               
              investigations in furgal, plant, and mammalian cells.
