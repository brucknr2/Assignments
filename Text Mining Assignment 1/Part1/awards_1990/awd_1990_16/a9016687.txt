Abstract    :
              The supernova phase of evolution in massive stars is important to              
              understand because it is during this violent stage that most of the            
              heavy element atoms in the Universe are created, including the                 
              iron-group of elements responsible for life, and the generation of             
              magnetic fields in planets.  Supernova SN1987a is arguably the most            
              intensively studied object outside the solar system since its                  
              explosion in the Large Magellanic Cloud was first observed in early            
              1987.   Already studies of this object, the first bright supernova,            
              in the modern era of astronomy, have uncovered several surprises,              
              for example, that stars that become supernovae can be red in color             
              rather than blue, as astronomical theories have predicted.                     
              Moreover, Supernova SN1987a, being one of only two supernovae to               
              be studied continuously since its outburst, furnishes a unique                 
              opportunity to understand the very early evolution of a supernova,             
              e.g., over the first decade.   The Principal Investigator (PI)                 
              proposes to construct theoretical models to explain the emission               
              of light from SN1987a using the most up-to-date information on                 
              shock wave physics.                                                            
                                                                                             
              Although it is thought that the slowly fading light outputs of most            
              supernovae are powered by the radioactive decay of unstable nickel             
              and cobolt isotopes, several details of the light output in SN1987a            
              rule out this possibility.  The PI intends to focus on this problem            
              in this program and to construct numerical models to that would                
              include effects by the most likely alternative mechanisms:   (1.)              
              interaction of the exploding supernova gas shell with material                 
              lingering near the star that was previously part of a "stellar                 
              wind" ejected by unrelated causes, and (2.) the generation of a                
              second shock wave caused by the birth of a magnetized neutron star             
              (pulsar) as a consequence of the supernova explosion.   The answer             
              to this question is expected to affect our understanding of a                  
              significant fraction of supernova during their early phases, and               
              will have a critical bearing on attempts to understand later stages            
              of supernovae.
