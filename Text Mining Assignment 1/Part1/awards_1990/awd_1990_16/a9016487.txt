Abstract    :
              This award will support the participation of six U.S.                          
              scientists in a joint seminar on "Selectivity in Synthetic                     
              and Bio-organic Chemistry," to be held in Tokyo, Japan, June                   
              2-7, 1991.  The focus of the meetings will be on the dynamic                   
              scientific advances in the area of asymmetric synthesis,                       
              which spans the entire spectrum of organic and inorganic                       
              chemistry.  A U.S.-Japan seminar on this subject in 1981                       
              served as an opportunity for research groups in the two                        
              countries to share ideas and information.  During the last                     
              decade, however, there has been a virtual explosion in the                     
              discovery of reactions that deliver levels of stereocontrol                    
              once thought to be impossible to achieve via non-enzymatic                     
              means.  The impact of these new tools, coupled with the new                    
              enzymatic and microbial technologies, has dramatically                         
              redefined the way absolute stereochemical,  regiochemical and                  
              functional group selectivity issues in synthesis are being                     
              addressed in both academic and industrial environments.  A                     
              multitude of new chiral reagents and catalysts now exist that                  
              are capable of exerting near-perfect control over those bond                   
              constructions where new stereochemical relationships are                       
              established.  The development of these new technologies are                    
              based on recent, deep understanding of fundamental issues of                   
              selectivity and molecular recognition.  The enormous importance                
              of this area is manifested in the highly international and                     
              cross-disciplinary nature of the primary contributions in                      
              the literature.                                                                
                                                                                             
              The co-organizers of the seminar are Professor Robert M.                       
              Williams of Colorado State Unversity and Professor Kenji Koga                  
              of the University of Tokyo.  The main topics to be discussed                   
              are new asymmetric synthetic methodologies; enzymatic, whole                   
              cell and cell-free bio-reactor technologies; total synthesis                   
              of natural products; biosynthesis; catalytic antibodies; and                   
              reaction mechanisms.  In addition, a poster session will be                    
              organized for young Japanese industrial chemists.
