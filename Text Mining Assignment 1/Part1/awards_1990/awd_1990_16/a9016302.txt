Abstract    :
              This renewal proposal will apply a novel technique of spray                    
              pyrolysis of molecular precursors to the preparation of thin films             
              of oxides and sulfides on various substrates.  The technique,                  
              developed by the Principal Investigator, will be applied to                    
              chromium oxide, gallium oxide, and zirconium oxide, and to zinc                
              sulfide and zinc selinide doped with various magnetic ions.                    
              Physical characterization of the films will include optical                    
              microscopy, electron and x-ray diffraction and electronic                      
              resistivity measurements.  Chemical characterization will include              
              a study of stability towards oxidation and/or reduction, and a                 
              correlation of properties exhibited by the films and bulk materials            
              of corresponding compositions.
