Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Oregon State University's College of Oceanography requests                     
              funding to support a mentoring and research-participation program              
              for Native American undergraduate students. The long-term goal of              
              this program is to increase the number of American Indian and                  
              Native Alaskan undergraduates who complete degrees in science,                 
              continue to graduate school, and enter the professional                        
              scientific work force.  This goal will be achieved by providing                
              the financial support and mentoring necessary for these students               
              to continue their higher education, and by widening their career               
              choices through meaningful and active participation in on-going                
              research projects at OSU during the regular academic year and in               
              the summer.  This research experience will 1) educated them in                 
              the science and 2) overcome cultural barriers to career                        
              possibilities. //
