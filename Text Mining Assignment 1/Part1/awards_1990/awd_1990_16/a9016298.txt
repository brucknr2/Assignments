Abstract    :
              This award supports cooperative research in algebra, geometry                  
              and computation between David Eisenbud of Brandeis University                  
              and Aron Simis of the Universidade Federal de Pernambuco in                    
              Brazil.  The subjects of collaboration are:  1) Special                        
              Determinantal varieties, 2) Rees Algebras, 3) Computational                    
              Methods, and 4) Weierstrass Points.  The first two subjects                    
              will make heavy use of computations made using a highly                        
              efficient computer algebra system oriented toward commutative                  
              algebra and algebraic geometry.  In addition to the work on                    
              these two projects Eisenbud and Simis will do collaborative                    
              work on Macaulay development, using some of the techniques                     
              that Simis has developed for his projects.  In addition, Rio                   
              is a center of work on Weierstrass points of curves.                           
                                                                                             
              The principal investigators on this project will receive                       
              support for a graduate student as well as some equipment.                      
              These are both strong mathematicians who have each made                        
              substantial contributions to commutative algebra and algebraic                 
              geometry.  The problems they pose to work on are central and                   
              important.
