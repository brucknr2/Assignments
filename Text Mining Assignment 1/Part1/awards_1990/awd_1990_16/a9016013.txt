Abstract    :
              This proposal is aimed at the synthesis of a new class of liquid               
              crystal materials that exhibit changes in selected properties by               
              the polarization states of incident light.  Photochemical,                     
              physical and chiroptic properties of model chiral chromophores                 
              will be examined as potential photoresolvable mesogens or                      
              dopants.  Phase formation will be studied by optical or electro-               
              optical means such as reflection, rotation, or ferroelectric                   
              behavior, and the photoinduction of twisted phases by irradiation              
              with circularly polarized light will be used to examine oriented               
              liquid crystalline phases of appropriately constructed                         
              photoresolvable mesogens.
