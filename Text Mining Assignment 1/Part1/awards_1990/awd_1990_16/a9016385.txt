Abstract    :
              Funding is requested for a state-of-the-art multiple frequency                 
              ESP-300E EPR spectrometer system with X-band capability liquid                 
              helium and nitrogen variable temperature systems, a variable                   
              temperature goniometer and a microwave counters.  This research                
              equipment will be used for several diverse projects.  These                    
              include:  multiple frequency EPR investigations of model heme                  
              complexes, bis-histidine coordinated cytochromes b and c, and                  
              mixed metal cobalt-substituted hemoglobins; EPR investigations of              
              newly isolated c-type cytochromes and of mutant cytochromes c                  
              produced by site-directed mutagenesis; multiple frequency EPR                  
              investigations of the molybdenum and heme centers of sulfite                   
              oxidase and model molybdenum (V) complexes; EPR investigations of              
              photochemically or electrochemically produced radicals of                      
              organosulfur compounds and investigations of copper complexes of               
              organosulfur compounds; EPR studies of the quenching of the                    
              intrinsic fluorescence of model membrane-bound peptide or protein              
              residue due to the presence of spin labels on lipids in the model              
              membranes, and the use of EPR to investigate the kinetics of                   
              polymerization of model membrane component; and EPR investigation              
              of the kinetics of electron transfer processes involving protein-              
              small molecular and protein-protein systems.
