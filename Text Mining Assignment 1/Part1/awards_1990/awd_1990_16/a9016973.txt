Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              It is proposed to apply the newly developed method of pulsed,                  
              time resolved photoacoustics to the study of photosynthesis and                
              photoinitiated electron transfer reactions.  This methodology                  
              allows the determination of the enthalpies of the initial                      
              reactions, that of the time resolved steps, and that of the                    
              slow reactants or stable products.  The kinetics of                            
              photosynthetic and photochemical reactions are now well                        
              understood, and intermediate steps fairly well known.  However,                
              the thermodynamic parameters of these intermediates are only                   
              poorly known.  Since the pulsed, time resolved photoacoustic                   
              methodology identifies a change in enthalpy with its kinetics,                 
              the latter can be used to identify the intermediate.  The                      
              thermodynamic efficiency of the intact system: cell or a whole                 
              leaf, can be so studied.  The results will allow a much better                 
              understanding of the energetics of the photosynthetic process                  
              and of electron transfer reactions.                                            
                                                                                             
              Dr. Mauzerall will also continue to work on the sizes of                       
              photosynthetic units and on the effect of the molecular                        
              environment on electron tunneling reactions.
