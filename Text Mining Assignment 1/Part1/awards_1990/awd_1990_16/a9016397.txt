Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The proposed research will involve the critical evaluation of                  
              pollen, primarily using transmission and scanning electron                     
              microscopy, from those gymnosperm groups suggested as closely                  
              related to angiosperms and implicated as possible ancestors.                   
              Only a paucity of data has been reported on pollen from the                    
              gymnospermous plants proposed to be investigated.  A small                     
              database is currently in existence for dispersed gymnosperm                    
              pollen as well as pollen with possible angiosperm affinities.                  
              The proposed study, however, will principally address the nature               
              of in site pollen grains from the various gymnosperm groups.                   
              Such a narrow focus, employing electron microscopic techniques,                
              allows for the accumulations of significant data regarding                     
              specific pollen characters and provides the opportunity to                     
              perform phylogenetic analyses using many more characters from the              
              specific taxa in question as well as to address numerous                       
              correlative and mechanistic queries concerning in situ pollen.                 
              Funds are requested to defray the costs of travel by the student               
              investigator to two selected domestic paleobotanical collections               
              of gymnosperms and one foreign collection in order to collect in               
              situ specimens for investigation.
