Abstract    :
                   The objective of this research is to investigate a                        
              mathematical tolerance allocation approach for design based on                 
              desired product specification and known manufacturing process                  
              variability.  The allocation criteria will be compared to the                  
              tolerance analysis based on Monte Carlo statistical methods used               
              in the VSA (Variation Simulation Analysis) commercial package.                 
              Once it is understood how the distributions are combined, a formal             
              tolerance allocation methodology will then be completed.  This                 
              approach is a more empirical approach of pre-determining allowable             
              part tolerance as opposed to the "what-if" tests conducted on the              
              VSA software
