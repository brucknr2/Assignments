Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A biosystematic study of the genus Caryota (Palmae) using                      
              morphological, anatomical, and DNA level analyses is proposed.                 
              The genus is a monophyletic group of tropical forest trees with                
              economic, evolutionary, and ecological importance.  Due to the                 
              variability of many morphological characters used in previous                  
              taxonomies, species delimitions within Caryota and phylogenetic                
              relationships among the caryotoid genera are not well resolved.                
              Datasets, derived independently from several lines of inquire                  
              including descriptive morphology and anatomy, geometric                        
              morphometry, chloroplast and nuclear genome restriction                        
              endonuclease site mapping, and palynology will be subjected to a               
              variety of phylogenetic analyses in an effort to establish a                   
              reliable taxonomy and monograph for the genus, examine                         
              phylogenetic relationships within and variable morphological                   
              characters within palms, examine patterns of molecular evolution               
              in the caryotoid palms, and explore patterns of biogeography and               
              speciation as expressed within the genus.
