Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Theoretical studies and computer simulations of limited gene flow              
              in uniformly distributed plant populations predict the                         
              development of patches of genetically similar individuals.  This               
              study will measure the fine-scale genetic structure of a large                 
              old-growth stand of Turkey Oak (Quercus laevis)  to test the                   
              isolation-by-distance model.  The age of this stand, its carpet-               
              like distribution, and the uniform habitat make it an excellent                
              test case for genetic isolation-by- distance in the most simple                
              circumstances.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              A plot of 160m X 160m will be surveyed on a 10m grid and 10 trees              
              will be sampled from each of 256 quadrats.  These will be                      
              genotyped for 12 polymorphic allozyme loci using starch gel                    
              electrophoresis.  Spatial structure will be described with                     
              spatial autocorrelation, spectral analysis, and stochastic                     
              models.  Paternity exclusion and mating system analysis will be                
              used to estimate the distribution of pollen and seed travel                    
              distances.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              Observed parameters of demography, outcrossing rate, and pollen                
              and seed dispersal will be used in a computer simulation to                    
              predict expected values of the spatial statistics which will be                
              compared with the observed values as a test of the isolation-by-               
              distance model.
