Abstract    :
              In this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and                            
              Organometallic Program of the Chemistry Division, Buchanan will                
              prepare synthetic analogues of the active sites of non-heme                    
              oxo-iron proteins.  These proteins are capable of functions                    
              ranging from oxygen transport and activation to phosphate ester                
              hydrolysis, yet little structural information about them is                    
              firmly established.                                                            
                                                                                             
              New oxo-bridged diiron complexes containing polyimidazole                      
              ligands will be synthesized and characterized.  Physical                       
              methods will include X-ray crystallography, electrochemical                    
              measurements, electronic spectroscopy, magnetic and Mossbauer                  
              studies, EPR, and NMR.  The binding of dioxygen, hydro-                        
              peroxide, and selected anions to the models containing open                    
              coordination sites will be examined. The oxygenase chemistry of                
              the binuclear complexes towards alkanes will be explored.
