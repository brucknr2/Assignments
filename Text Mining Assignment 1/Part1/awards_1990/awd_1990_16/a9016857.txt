Abstract    :
              Scientists from U.S. academic research institutions will participate in        
              an international workshop on "The Next Decade of Geoscience Research in        
              East Asia."  This workshop will bring together geologists,                     
              geophysicists, and other geoscientists from a number of countries to           
              review results of recent geosciences research in this region and to            
              consider recommendations for possible future programs in this area.            
              The workshop will focus on needs for interdisciplinary studies in four         
              broad areas: convergent margin processes; passive margin processes;            
              extensional magmatism; and mantle-lithosphere interactions.  The               
              results and recommendations of the workshop will be distributed to the         
              scientific community, both in the United States and other participating        
              countries; to interested components of private industry; and to                
              international scientific organizations.
