Abstract    :
              This award will support the participation of six U.S.                          
              scientists in a joint seminar on "Computers in Heat Transfer                   
              Science," to be held in Tokyo, Japan, in October 1991.  Among                  
              the main topics to be discussed are forced convection,                         
              natural convection, phase changes, radiative heat transfer,                    
              and heat transfer in combustion.  Experimental, theoretical,                   
              and a combination of the two approaches will also be featured.                 
              Significant issues to be addressed are:  (1) in what details                   
              can we theoretically clarify hitherto unresolved heat                          
              transfer processes, if the performance of computers is                         
              upgraded 10-fold or even 100-fold from that of computers                       
              available today; (2) how far can we improve the accuracy of                    
              heat transfer measurements if we are equipped with data                        
              acquisition and processing equipment in the laboratory that                    
              are more powerful than that currently available by a factor                    
              of 10 or 100; and (3) what role can heat transfer specialists                  
              play to develop the technology that is essential in ushering                   
              in computing equipment that is 10 or even 100 times more                       
              powerful than those in existence today?                                        
                                                                                             
              The advent of computers has played a major role in the                         
              advancement of the science of heat transfer as well as in the                  
              solution of many practical problems.  Both the United States                   
              and Japan have made significant contributions to advance the                   
              knowledge of heat transfer and are also among the most                         
              advanced countries in the development and utilization of                       
              microelectronics and computing technology.  The objective of                   
              the seminar is to bring together leading researchers from                      
              both countries in an effective forum to review the current                     
              impact of computers in heat transfer research and discuss how                  
              the continuing advances in computer technology will impact                     
              the development of heat transfer science.  The co-organizers                   
              of the meeting are Professor Kwangtzu Yang of the University                   
              of Notre Dame and Professor Wataru Nakayama of the Tokyo                       
              Institute of Technology.  This seminar is the third in a                       
              series of joint meetings between the United States                             
              and Japan sponsored by NSF and the Japan Society for the                       
              Promotion of Science.  The first was held in Tokyo in 1981                     
              and the second in San Diego in 1985.
