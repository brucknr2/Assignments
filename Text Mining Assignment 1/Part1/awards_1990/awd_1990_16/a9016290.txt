Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The project will take advantage of the                                         
              opportunity provided by Hurricane Hugo to                                      
              study its impact on historical buildings in                                    
              Charleston, S.C.  The study consists of three                                  
              parts:  1) a detailed compilation of the                                       
              structural and other damages to historic                                       
              buildings; 2) the identification of the steps                                  
              taken by managers and owners of cultural                                       
              property to reduce vulnerability; and 3) the                                   
              effectiveness of the preparedness plans,                                       
              organizational arrangements and response                                       
              capabilities used in the emergency response,                                   
              salvage and recovery operations, before and                                    
              after the hurricane.  The identification and                                   
              assessment of the measures taken in this case                                  
              which resulted in the effective mitigation of                                  
              damages will benefit those responsible for                                     
              cultural property in other disaster prone                                      
              areas with these measures serving as models.
