Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award provides support for the participation of six US                    
              scientists in a joint US-Japan seminar on "Magmatic Contribu-                  
              tions to Hydrothermal Systems: Magnitude and Importance".                      
              Hydrothermal systems form where heat and water meet in the                     
              earths crust.  One important aspect of research on hydrothermal                
              systems is the role of magmas.  Continuing study of fossil                     
              and active hydrothermal systems makes it clear that magmas                     
              can contribute to these systems in several different ways but                  
              such contributions can be difficult to recognize and                           
              characterize.   Difficulties arise, for example, because                       
              magmatic contributions are small in relation to the total                      
              mass of the hydrothermal system and because they undergo                       
              rapid modification by reaction with other constituents of the                  
              system.  A further impediment is the wide range of disciplines                 
              involved including, for example, field geology, experimental                   
              geochemistry, thermodynamic modelling, water geochemistry and                  
              geophysics.  In order to gain a comprehensive understanding                    
              of the importance of magmatic contributions to the evolution                   
              of hydrothermal systems, interaction among scientists in                       
              these fields is required.                                                      
                                                                                             
              The seminar will be held Novemeber 10-16, 1991 at Kagoshima                    
              and Ebino, Kyushu, Japan. The co-organizers are Professor                      
              Stephen E Kesler, Department of Geology, University of                         
              Michigan, and Dr Eiji Izawa, Department of Mining, Kyushu                      
              University, Fukuoka, Japan.  Specific topics to be discussed                   
              include (1) igneous petrology of magmas; (2) the                               
              composition of volcanic discharges and their relation to                       
              magmatic fluids; (3) fluid inclusion and geochemical studies                   
              of epithermal and geothermal systems; and (4) chemical and                     
              physical modelling of magmatic hydrothermal systems.                           
              Although the US and Japan each have many Scientists active in                  
              this field, contact between these two groups is not as                         
              extensive as it could be.  The seminar will allow represent-                   
              atives from the two countries to meet and exchange                             
              information and it is anticipated that more extensive                          
              research collaboration will result.
