Abstract    :
              This award supports cooperative research on steroid hormones                   
              to be conducted by Anthony Norman of the University of                         
              California at Riverside and his Argentine colleague R. Boland                  
              of the National University of the South in Bahia Blanca,                       
              Argentina.  They propose a collaborative research program                      
              directed towards studies on the biochemical mode of action of                  
              the hormonally active form of vitamin D.  While it is                          
              generally accepted that steroid hormones generate biological                   
              responses through regulation of gene expression, it is not                     
              widely accepted that steroid hormones can generate significant                 
              biological responses through mechanisms not dependent upon                     
              immediate regulation of gene expression.  Both laboratories                    
              have published a series of papers reporting that 1,25(OH)2D3                   
              can generate biological responses in muscle (Bahia Blanca)                     
              and the intestine (Riverside) by nuclear receptor-mediated                     
              modulation of gene expression as well as by a pathway(s) in                    
              which a putative membrane recognition element for 1,25(OH)2D3                  
              is implicated in processes which generate biological responses                 
              within 1-5 minutes.                                                            
                                                                                             
              The major objectives of this proposal are (a) to initiate a                    
              collaborative characterization of the membrane-related                         
              receptor for 1,25(OH)2D3 in intestine, HL-60 cells and muscle                  
              and compare it with the classical nuclear receptor for                         
              1,25 (OH)2D3 and (b) further define the biochemical details                    
              of the signal transduction pathway leading to "rapid"                          
              biological responses which lead in the intestine to the                        
              process of "transcaltachia" or the very rapid stimulation of                   
              intestinal calcium absorption.  Specifically the Riverside                     
              laboratory will study the role of 1,25(OH)2D3 receptors in                     
              (a) gene expression particularly as exemplified by examination                 
              of the calbindin-D28K gene's promoter and (b) the process of                   
              transcaltachia or the very rapid stimulation of intestinal                     
              calcium transport (via nongenomic mechanisms).  The Bahia                      
              Blanca laboratory will study the function and mechanism of                     
              action of 1,25(OH)2D3 and its receptor(s) in muscle.  This                     
              work will formalize an existing active collaboration.
