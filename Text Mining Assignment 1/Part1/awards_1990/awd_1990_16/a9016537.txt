Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The objective of this research is the measurement of the                  
              relative contribution of upwind sources to those observed at a                 
              single location using a new micrometeorological facility (ASTER)               
              available from the National Center for Atmospheric Research.  The              
              upwind sources will comprise a 400 m line source of an inert gas               
              and eddy correlation measurements will be made at four separate                
              downwind locations.  The observations will be interpreted with                 
              the aid of an existing stochastic model of turbulent exchange.
