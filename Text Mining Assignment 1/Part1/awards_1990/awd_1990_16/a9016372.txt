Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              This work will extend the observations made as part of the U.S.                
              JGOFS Bermuda Atlantic Time Series (BATS) Program to include                   
              detailed optical oceanographic measurements.  These                            
              observations are necessary to develop and evaluate optically-                  
              based primary production models.                                               
                                                                                             
              The goals are to:                                                              
                                                                                             
              1)   Characterize the optical properties at the BATS site;                     
                   temporally seasonally, as well as on diel time                            
                   scales), spatially (as a function of dept) and                            
                   spectrally (by color of light);                                           
                                                                                             
              2)   Examine the light utilization by the phytoplankton                        
                   community and its temporal variability;                                   
                                                                                             
              3)   Develop and evaluate bio-optical models for                               
                   determining in situ irradiance spectra and primary                        
                   production rates from standard incident irradiance                        
                   and pigment concentration measurements; and                               
                                                                                             
              4)   Provide the "optical link" by which the BATS                              
                   observations may be used to evaluate bio-optical                          
                   models for pigment concentration, primary production,                     
                   and sinking particle fluxes from future satellite-                        
                   based ocean color sensors.
