Abstract    :
              The objective of this research is to measure the vertical                      
              component of the electric field in the atmosphere using a                      
              modified radiosonde and field mill attached to a free balloon.                 
              The measurements will serve to verify an alternate technique                   
              using tethered kites by evaluating local meteorological                        
              influences which could affect the conductivity of the air or the               
              apparatus.  The measurements will be conducted on Christmas                    
              Island, Republic of Kiribati.
