Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The study will investigate phylogenetic relationships within the               
              genus Lopezia (Onagraceae) using molecular techniques involving                
              chloroplast and ribosomal DNA.  Particular emphasis will be on                 
              (1) the relationships of the morphologically divergent sections                
              within the genus, (2) the tempo, mode, and pattern of molecular                
              evolution, (3) the congruence of rates of morphological and                    
              molecular evolution, (4) the origins of chromosome number changes              
              in section Pelozia, and (5) the comparative genetic variation                  
              within and among widespread and locally endemic species.  The                  
              study will integrate field and laboratory work, and will help                  
              clarify the relationships between molecular studies and                        
              phylogenetic and taxonomic studies based on morphology, cytology,              
              anatomy, and biochemistry.
