Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award provides support for the participation of six US                    
              scientists in a joint US-Japan seminar on the "Physics of                      
              High Power Laser Matter Interactions".  The seminar will be                    
              held on March 9-13, 1992 in Osaka, Japan.  The co-organizers                   
              are Professor George Miley, Department of Nuclear Engineering,                 
              University of Illinois and Professor Sadao Nakai, Institute                    
              of Laser Engineering, Osaka University, Japan.  Specific                       
              topics to be discussed at the seminar include (1) laser                        
              plasma interactions; (2) radiation and atomic processes and                    
              energy transport; and (3) physics and applications of high                     
              density plasmas to fusion, accelerator, x-ray lasers and                       
              industrial processes.  This will be the fifth seminar on this                  
              topic dating back to 1972, the last being held in 1988.                        
              Since then there have been a number of rapid developments in                   
              the field and it is therefore timely to hold another seminar.                  
                                                                                             
              The seminar will concentrate upon the physics of laser                         
              interaction with various media ranging from solids to                          
              plasmas.  Using powerful lasers, unique high-density plasmas                   
              can be generated.  Much fundamental research is being                          
              undertaken aimed at understanding the processes involved in                    
              these laser-plasma interactions and at developing applications                 
              for laser produced plasmas.  The United States and Japan have                  
              two of the most advanced laser laboratory facilities in the                    
              world and researchers from both countries have made a number                   
              of very important contributions to the field.  The seminar                     
              will permit representatives from several research groups in                    
              the two countries to meet and exchange information which                       
              should lead to more extensive research collaboration.
