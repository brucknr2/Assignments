              Technical Narrative:                                                           
                                                                                             
              This U.S.-Rwanda collaborative research planning project                       
              involving the University of Minnesota and the Universite                       
              Nationale de Rwanda is in the general area of aquatic resource                 
              conservation.  Proposal funding will allow the team from the                   
              University of Minnesota to work with their Rwandan counterparts                
              for a three week period to develop a research proposal to study                
              stream ecosystems in high altitude forests of Rwanda.  One of the              
              proposed outcomes of this research will be the establishment of a              
              resource management protocol for the conservation of tropical                  
              rainforest biomes.                                                             
                                                                                             
              This project in resource conservation fulfills the program                     
              objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading                
              experts in the United States and Rwanda to combine complementary               
              talents and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual                  
              interest and competence.
