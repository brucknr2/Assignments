Abstract    :
              Using ac calorimetry, heat capacity measurements will be carried               
              out on a series of different hydrocarbon films adsorbed on                     
              graphite.  A main focus of the work proposed is the study of the               
              melting transition of two-dimensional (2D) solids.  Using a set of             
              different hydrocarbon films we shall systematically study how the              
              nature of the melting transition depends on the size and shape of              
              the molecules which constitute the 2D solid.  This systematic                  
              approach is of interest because recent theoretical results indicate            
              that 2D melting is strongly influenced by molecular size and shape.            
              We have completed the first stage of this research with their study            
              of ethane films.                                                               
                                                                                             
              Following up some preliminary results on ethane, we shall study the            
              melting of thin hydrocarbon multilayers as well as the behavior                
              near the bulk triple point of small bulk hydrocarbon crystallites              
              adsorbed on graphite.  In the high coverage regime they purpose is             
              to determine whether exfoliated graphite can be used as substrate              
              for studying surface melting.
