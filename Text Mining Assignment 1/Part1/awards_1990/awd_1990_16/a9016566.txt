Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A collaboration will be established between the National Center                
              for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois,                 
              under the direction of Dr. Larry Smarr, and the biological                     
              research group at the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research              
              at Cambridge, Massachusetts, under the direction of Dr. Eric                   
              Lander.  This collaboration will work toward developing a                      
              software package for analyzing clone fingerprint data used for                 
              constructing physical maps of genomes.                                         
                                                                                             
              Specifically, the project will involve extending the NCSA                      
              GelReader software (already developed by NCSA) so that it will be              
              capable of combining information from multiple hybridization                   
              images of the same blot to obtain much more accurate information               
              about fragment sizes, thereby allowing NCSA GelReader to be used               
              for physical mapping projects.
