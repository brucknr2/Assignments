Abstract    :
              In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program                 
              of the Chemistry Division, Prof. Heaven will study the                         
              electronic spectra of open-shell van der Waals molecules.  Such                
              studies should help understand collisional processes involving                 
              atoms or molecules having unpaired electrons.                                  
                                                                                             
              High resolution electronic spectra will be obtained for several                
              prototype molecules consisting of diatomic radicals and a noble                
              gas atom such as neon or argon.  Molecular constants derived                   
              from these spectra will be used to determine potential energy                  
              surfaces for the electronically excited and ground states.                     
              Electronic and vibrational predissociation rates will be                       
              measured for excited states, and calculations of these rates                   
              will be made based on experimentally derived potential energy                  
              surfaces.
