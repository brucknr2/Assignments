Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A methodology will be developed for                                            
              comprehensive and quantitative mathematical                                    
              simulation of warning systems for rapid-onset                                  
              natural hazards.  The methodology will                                         
              encompass all major factors that determine                                     
              the performance of a total warning system:                                     
              geophysical, technological, organizational,                                    
              behavioral, and economic factors.  Next,                                       
              mathematical models of warning systems will                                    
              be developed for two types of hazards:  flash                                  
              floods and riverine floods.  The purpose of                                    
              the models will be to provide a scientific                                     
              basis and analytic means for engineering                                       
              design, operation, evaluation of performance,                                  
              and benefit-cost analyses of warning systems.                                  
              Engineering usefulness of the models will be                                   
              tested through representative applications.
