Abstract    :
              This is a proposal to develop an instrument for the automated                  
              analysis of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) in salt and fresh                 
              waters and soil solutions and to couple it with an existing                    
              dissolved organic carbon analyzer (DOC) marketed by Ionics, Inc.               
              This development will be carried out in collaboration with                     
              Ionics, Inc, a company with which we have been interacting for 2               
              years in refining their Model 1500 DOC analyzer.                               
                                                                                             
              Seven major and 1 minor projects at The Ecosystems Center, funded              
              at a level exceeding $10,250,000 over the next 5 years, want to                
              and need to make use of a DON analyzer.  Projects range from                   
              studies of the origins and biological use of dissolved organic                 
              matter in estuaries, to atmospheric loading of nitrogen and N                  
              saturation of temperate forests, to N cycling in marine sediments              
              and to the organic matter decomposition, nutrient mineralization               
              and transfer across the tundra landscape and down arctic rivers.
