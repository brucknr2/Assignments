Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary objective of this U.S.-Poland research                             
              project between Dr. Zdzislaw Musielak of the University                        
              of Alabama and Dr. Marceli Krogulec of the University of                       
              Gdansk is to study the mechanism by which cool stars                           
              return matter to the interstellar medium.  To do this,                         
              the researchers will examine the propagation, reflection                       
              and trapping of Alfven waves in atmospheres of late-type                       
              giants and supergiants (stars).  Findings will be used                         
              to construct models of cool massive stellar winds which                        
              account for observed wind energetics and radiation                             
              losses.  Results are expected to provide an explanation                        
              of stellar mass loss and contribute to our basic                               
              understanding of the complex physics occurring in the                          
              atmospheres of such stars.                                                     
                                                                                             
              This project on stars and stellar evolution fulfills the                       
              program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by                         
              enabling leading researchers in the United States and                          
              Poland to combine complementary efforts and capabilities                       
              in areas of strong mutual interest and competence in the                       
              field of basic scientific research on the basis of                             
              equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.
