Abstract    :
              Professor Parson is supported by a grant from the Experimental                 
              Physical Chemistry Program to study reactions of atoms and                     
              molecules by crossing one molecular beam with another.  The                    
              products are to be detected by chemiluminescence and                           
              laser-induced fluorescence so that the energy states in which                  
              the products are formed can be determined.  These studies will                 
              map out the elementary steps which make up the chemical                        
              reaction.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              Molecular beam studies of reactions of Group VA atoms,                         
              clusters, and hydrides with halogens and oxidizers will be                     
              carried out.  Products will be detected by electronic                          
              chemiluminescence or laser-induced fluorescence, and the Group                 
              VA molecular beam composition will be manipulated by a                         
              combination of thermal, electric discharge, and                                
              photodissociation techniques.  The results should be relevant                  
              to understanding mechanisms in bulk reaction systems.  In                      
              addition to identifying important elementary steps, single                     
              collision studies will provide information about the disposal                  
              of reaction energy in products.  By accessing different                        
              potential surfaces with variable collision energy, major                       
              characteristics of those surfaces can be inferred.
