Abstract    :
                   A method of measuring and monitoring the transport of the                 
              Antarctic Circumpolar Current has been developed and tested in                 
              the Drake Passage.  Differences in pressure measured by deep                   
              pressure gauges on either side of a current provide a proxy for                
              the transport.  This effort will consist of the deployment of a                
              suite of such pressure gauges south of Australia and south of                  
              Africa.  A total of 6 sites will be instrumented for several                   
              years.  A related deployment will be made by scientists from the               
              UK in Drake Passage enabling an analysis of the variations in                  
              transport at the three choke points around the Southern Ocean.                 
              These data will be useful in determining the interbasin                        
              transport, an objective of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment              
              (WOCE).
