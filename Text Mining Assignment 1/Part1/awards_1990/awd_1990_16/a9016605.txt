Abstract    :
              Description:  This project supports travel of ten U.S.                         
              physicists to a "Workshop in High Energy Physics                               
              Phenomenalogy II" planned for January 2-15, 1991 in                            
              Culcutta, India.  The organizer is Dr. P. Majumdar of the                      
              S.N. Bose National Centre for Basic Sciences in Culcutta.                      
              Topics will include 1.  Structure functions at low X,                          
              polarized structure functions, and higher order QCD                            
              contributions for jets, W, Z and heavy flavour production;                     
              2.  Low energy weak interactions (hedronic matrix elements,                    
              B- Physics); 3.  New particle search; and 4.  Electro -                        
              weak radiative corrections to electro - weak processes and                     
              2 W physics.  Participation will include scientists from                       
              India, the U.S., U.K., Germany, France, Switzerland,                           
              Sweden, Japan, Austria, and Poland.  Much of the                               
              presentations will cover theoretical research, with                            
              experimental work contributed by four Indian and a number                      
              of European and U.S. scientists.  The meeting will include                     
              three days of presentations to be followed by one week of                      
              separate working groups on specific subtopics under group                      
              leaders.  The group leaders will present the results on the                    
              final day of the workshop.                                                     
                                                                                             
              Scope:  This is the second such workshop.  The first was                       
              held in January 1989 at Tata Institute of Fundamental                          
              Research in Bombay which resulted in proceedings published                     
              by World Scientific.  The two week intensive interaction                       
              between senior visiting scientists and young Indian                            
              scientists is expected to lead to emerging new ideas and                       
              new results for expanding the present knowledge of basic                       
              science.  It is also likey that future collaboration would                     
              result from this interaction.
