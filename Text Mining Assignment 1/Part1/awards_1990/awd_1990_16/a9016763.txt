Abstract    :
              This is support for a symposium entitled "New                                  
              Service Opportunities for Electric Utilities:  Creating                        
              Differentiated Products" to be held at the University                          
              of California - Berkeley on September 12 - 14, 1990.                           
              The main topic is product differentiation in the                               
              power industry, an industry which is partially                                 
              regulated and partially deregulated.  The symposium                            
              is also being supported by the Electric Power                                  
              Research Institute (EPRI) and the University of                                
              California Universitywide Energy Research Group.
