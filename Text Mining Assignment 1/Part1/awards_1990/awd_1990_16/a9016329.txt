Abstract    :
                 The expectation maximization (EM) algorithm is an iterative                 
              algorithm which can be used to obtain maximum-likelihood (ML)                  
              estimates in situations where a direct attack on the problem fails.            
              In this research the PI will study the application of the EM                   
              algorithm to the problem of optimal decoding of trellis coded                  
              modulation signals in the presence of white Gaussian noise and                 
              random parameters. Specifically, the work will focus on two                    
              channels: the random phase channel and the random timing error                 
              channel.  For each of these channels, the optimum receiver                     
              processing will be described, as well as its performance using                 
              existing trellis codes; further the implications of the optimal                
              processing on the coding problem will be addressed.
