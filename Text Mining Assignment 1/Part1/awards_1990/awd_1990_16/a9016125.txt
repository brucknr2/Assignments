Abstract    :
              The proposed instrumentation will be used primarily in research                
              on the distribution of power in exchange networks.  The central                
              question of this research tradition is how position in a network               
              of exchange relations confers relative advantage or disadvantage               
              in obtaining favorable rates of exchange with partners.  The                   
              instrumentation will be used to configure a network of PCs, all                
              linked to each other through a main file server.  Experimenters                
              will be able to realize any communication network design by                    
              blocking communication channels between any two subject PCs and                
              thus investigate the effect of network shape on the distribution               
              of power among subjects.  The instrumentation makes possible the               
              systematic manipulation of additional "parameters of exchange"                 
              beyond network configuration.  Finally, the particular                         
              combination of hardware and software provides ideal capabilities               
              for online data records of all significant events in the exchange              
              process.
