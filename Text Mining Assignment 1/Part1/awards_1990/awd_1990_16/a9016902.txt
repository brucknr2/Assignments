Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports the participation of six US scientists                     
              in a joint US-Japan seminar on "Biology of the Epidermis,"                     
              July 21-25, 1991 in Sapporo, Japan.  The co-organizers are                     
              Professor Joseph McGuire, Department of Dermatology, Stanford                  
              University School of Medicine, and Professor Akira Ohkawara,                   
              Department of Dermatology, Hokkaido University School of                       
              Medicine, Sapporo, Japan.  Specific topics to be discussed at                  
              the seminar include (1) stratum corneum and extracellular                      
              lipids; (2) structural proteins of the epidermis; (3)                          
              regulation of proliferation and differentiation, vitamin D3,                   
              growth factors and cytokines; and (4) expression of oncogenes                  
              by keratinocytes. This will be the fifth seminar on this                       
              subject since 1976.  These seminars have played an important                   
              role in fostering and promoting interactions between US and                    
              Japanese dermatologists and skin researchers.  Because much                    
              information on the epidermis has become known since the last                   
              seminar in 1985, the proposed seminar is particularly timely.                  
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
              The epidermis covers the entire human body, protecting                         
              internal organs and maintaining human homeostasis.  In order                   
              to perform protection and maintenance of proper homeostasis,                   
              the epidermis possesses highly organized features and                          
              functions.  Much research has been undertaken to try to                        
              understand these, concentrating on defining the morphological                  
              and biochemical properties of the epidermis.  The field is                     
              expanding rapidly, particularly in the areas of molecular                      
              biology and regulation of cell growth and differentiation.                     
              Significant contributions are currently being made to the                      
              field of skin science, which should eventually lead to the                     
              resolution of the pathogenesis of various skin diseases.                       
              Because the seminar will address topics where significant                      
              recent advances have been made, the meeting should bring the                   
              U.S. and Japanese research communities up to date and                          
              stimulate future collaborative projects.
