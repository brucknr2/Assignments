Abstract    :
              This is a project to study the engineering feasibility of                      
              a concept to use ozone in place of air as an agent for                         
              venting or otherwise removing chlorinated organic                              
              chemicals from soil contaminated by these compounds.                           
              Specific objectives include determination of the limits of                     
              reactivity of ozone with the target organic compounds and                      
              engineering constraints on the use of this concept                             
              including the effect of background organic substances,                         
              initial contaminant concentrations, soil type and moisture                     
              content.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              Contamination of groundwaters by organic chemicals leaking                     
              from underground storage tanks, surface storage facilities                     
              and spills is a significant environmental problem in the                       
              United States.  The results of this project may be                             
              applicable to engineering design of processes and systems                      
              to removal these contaminants from soil.
