Abstract    :
              1With support from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry                 
              Program and the Materials Theory Program, Professor Silby will                 
              investigate three problems in quantum mechanics: (1) tunneling                 
              in gas and condensed phases, (2) spectroscopy of guest                         
              molecules in low temperature glasses, and (3) competing                        
              electron-phonon and electron-electron interactions in molecular                
              systems. The theoretical models that result will lead to a                     
              better understanding of the important experimental data                        
              generated in the above areas.                                                  
                                                                                             
              Tunneling in molecules and condensed phases will be studied for                
              both symmetric and asymmetric potentials. Hole burning in                      
              glasses will be investigated focusing on the basic aspects of                  
              energy states in glasses (interacting vs. non-interacting                      
              two-level systems) and their ramifications for imhomogeneous                   
              broadening. The dynamics in low dimensional molecular crystals                 
              and polymeric systems with competing interactions will be                      
              studied. These systems show a rich variety of possible states,                 
              such as charge density waves, spin density waves, and                          
              solitonic, polaronic, and bipolaronic defect states.
