Abstract    :
              Professor Dudley Herschbach is supported by a Small Grant for                  
              Exploratory Research from the Experimental Physical Chemistry                  
              Program to study molecular orientation in cold molecular beams                 
              by the application of strong electric fields. These                            
              measurements provide a new method to address questions                         
              concerning the importance of relative orientation between                      
              reacting molecules and the influence which molecular                           
              orientation has on chemical reactivity.                                        
                                                                                             
              Polar molecules with a three-fold or higher axis of symmetry in                
              certain rotational states will precess in an electric field                    
              rather than tumble.  The dipole moment therefore does not                      
              average out for such states, so an electric field can exert a                  
              torque which produces substantial orientation.  Orientation by                 
              an electric field has been considered quite impractical for                    
              less symmetrical molecules.  The rotational motion of diatomic,                
              linear, or asymmetric top molecules averages out the dipole                    
              moment in first-order, so the interaction with an electric                     
              field is much weaker.  Dr. Herschbach has performed feasibility                
              calculations which show, however, that even in these cases only                
              relatively modest Stark fields of 60,000 volts/cm are required                 
              to orient the lowest rotational states of linear molecules such                
              as ICN when they are cooled to 2 degrees Kelvin in a molecular                 
              beam.  This prediction, which Herschbach hopes to verify                       
              experimentally, would have an enormous impact on the whole                     
              field of reaction dynamics.  It would provide an important new                 
              capability to study orientation effects in colliding molecular                 
              beams which would be achievable at easily attainable                           
              experimental conditions.
