Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary objective of this U.S.-Czechoslovak research                       
              project between Dr. Thomas Jech of the Pennsylvania                            
              State University and Dr. Bohuslav Balcar of the                                
              Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences' Mathematical Institute                       
              is to examine mathematical problems in set theory and                          
              Boolean algebras.  Specifically the questions examined                         
              will deal with measures and ultrafilters on Boolean                            
              algebras, filters over uncountable cardinals, and                              
              properties of singular cardinals.  Large cardinals,                            
              forcing, and dynamical systems will also be studied.                           
                                                                                             
              The researchers expect to use their complementary                              
              expertise to extend measure theory as related to                               
              combinatorial properties of cardinals.                                         
                                                                                             
              This project in mathematics fulfills the program                               
              objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling                        
              leading experts in the United States and Eastern Europe                        
              to combine complementary talents and pool research                             
              resources in areas of strong mutual interest and                               
              competence.
