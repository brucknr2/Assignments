Abstract    :
              This award supports a program detailed of laboratory studies                   
              of subglacial materials obtained from immediately below the                    
              base of Ice Stream B in West Antarctica.  The four piston                      
              cores to be examined range in length from 2 to 3 meters.                       
              These core will be analyzed for their sedimentological                         
              characteristics and their physical and mechanical                              
              properties.  These studies will help to test the initial                       
              conclusion that the material composing these cores is                          
              glacial till that has been transported in a subglacial shear                   
              zone whose deformation lubricates the base of the ice                          
              stream, making possible the rapid motion characteristic of                     
              the ice streams.
