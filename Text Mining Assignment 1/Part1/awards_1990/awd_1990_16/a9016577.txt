              Description:  This project supports participation by eight                     
              U.S. scientists in a seminar and workshop on " Bioinorganic                    
              Chemistry" to be held in Madras, India, December 9 to 15,                      
              1990.  The Indian organizing committee is chaired by Dr.P.T.                   
              Monaharan of The Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) in                       
              Madras.  Several participants are expected from the U.K., the                  
              FRG, and the U.S.S.R.  The topics to be covered will include:                  
              the role of metal ions in biology; reaction mechanisms;                        
              optical, magnetic and catalytic properties of metal-ion                        
              containing systems; proteins, enzymes, ion transport; enzymes                  
              containing zinc, cobalt; vitamin B12 and B12 coenzymes; iron                   
              heme proteins; oxygenases, peroxidases, catalyses,                             
              cytochromes; chlorophylls and photosynthesis; non-heme iron                    
              proteins; iron transfer, electro transfer, electron transport                  
              proteins; molybdenum proteins and nitrogen fixation;                           
              nitrogenase, xanthine oxidases, dehydrogenases, sulphite                       
              aldehyde oxidases; copper proteins; construction of model                      
              system metal-containing sites; and applications in medicine.                   
                                                                                             
              Scope:  The area of the workshop is an important                               
              subdiscipline of chemistry which is gaining increasing                         
              attention in the developed countries but which is relatively                   
              new to developing countries.  The Government of India,                         
              Department of Science and Technology is attempting to                          
              stimulate interest and to increase education and research                      
              activities in the field partially through the sponsoring of                    
              this workshop.  Indian young researchers with potential for                    
              work in this area will be exposed to and will interact with                    
              senior Indian scientists and world leaders in the field                        
              through lectures and discussion sessions.  The U.S. side will                  
              benefit by the interaction with European and Indian                            
              scientists and by identifying potential collaborators from                     
              India.
