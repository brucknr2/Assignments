Abstract    :
              Funds are requested for acquisition of a storage phosphor imaging              
              device.  The research areas of the primary users are:  analysis                
              of recombination and chromosome organization, developmental                    
              regulation of gene expression, control of mRNA stability,                      
              transcriptional regulation, and the molecular basis of                         
              photosynthesis.  Secondary users are working on regulation of                  
              gene expression in prokaryotic viruses, developmental regulation               
              of antibiotic production, mapping mammalian genes, and the                     
              control elements of eukaryotic genes.  The biological systems                  
              used cover a wide range; Drosophila, mammals, cyanobacteria,                   
              eubacteria and higher plants.
