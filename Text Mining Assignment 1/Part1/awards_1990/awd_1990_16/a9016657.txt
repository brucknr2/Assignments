Abstract    :
              This project is concerned with the response of topical glaciers                
              to climatic forcing and comprises evaluation of satellite data,                
              analysis of glaciological mappings and measurement, modelling and              
              prediction.  It is focused on a few regional targets in                        
              accordance with suitable information.  A "topical satellite                    
              glaciology" may become a reality thanks to the fine spatial                    
              resolution of SPOT.  Mount Kenya is an obvious early target of                 
              opportunity because here a calibration is possible with our                    
              1:5,000 map of the ice status in September 1987.  For Kilimanjaro              
              satellite sensing shall be used to assess cryosphere changes                   
              since the early 1970's.  The forcing of the observed ice                       
              recession by direct solar radiation and greenhouse effects is to               
              be studied for these two glaciated mountains in East Africa,                   
              where the changing ice extent can be documented for various                    
              epochs over the past century and where the topography is well                  
              resolved by maps at appropriate scales.  Modelling of a causality              
              chain involving the ice dynamics is intended for the only two                  
              tropical glaciers with a suitable documentation of field                       
              observations.  For the Lewis Glacier on Mount Kenya, field                     
              observations shall be evaluated to verify modelling-based                      
              predictions and to ascertain effects of climatic change.  For the              
              Yanamarey Glacier in Peru's Cordillera Blanca, field observations              
              and modelling are to be combined to predict future developments,               
              as well as to reconstruct the past net balance conditions and the              
              climatic forcing responsible for the ice retreat over the past                 
              century.  In conjunction with similar earlier studies for New                  
              Guinea and East Africa, this would indicate the diversity in the               
              beginning of the ice recession across the global tropics.
