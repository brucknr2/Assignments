Abstract    :
              The research, in the general area of Analytical and Surface                    
              Chemistry, focuses on molten salt chemistry.  The work promises                
              to lead to the discovery of new clusters (collections of metal                 
              atoms or metal and chlorine atoms) and new chemistry for known                 
              clusters, as well as a greater insight into the nature and                     
              strength of solute ion-solvent ion interactions in molten salts.               
                                                                                             
              Tantalum, tungsten and molybdenum chlorine clusters containing                 
              up to six metal atoms will be examined building on the results                 
              of previous work together with new studies on homopolyatomic                   
              metal clusters.  Studies will be conducted in both acidic                      
              (molten salts with an excess of aluminum chloride) and basic                   
              (molten salts with an excess of an organic salt) media. Basic                  
              media will be used for the metal-chlorine clusters and acidic                  
              media will be used for studies of cationic clusters of cadmium,                
              mercury and bismuth with as many as nine metal atoms. The                      
              studies will be extended to other types of metal atom clusters                 
              in acidic media.  These molten salt studies will include                       
              studies of the electrochemical behavior of these clusters.
