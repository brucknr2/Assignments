Abstract    :
              The proposed research will include experimental and analytical                 
              works to study explicitly the interface behavior and its effect on             
              the global material behavior.  Principal Investigator expect to                
              quantify the role of interface strength on the behavior and provide            
              knowledge that will be essential in engineering the difficulty in              
              high strength concrete.  Thus, the proposed research is expected               
              to have a direct impact on the production and use of high strength             
              concrete in structures in efficient, economical, and safe manner.              
              Results of the proposed work will provide insight into the                     
              deformation behavior and failure mechanisms, and will allow the                
              development of methods for predicting failure in high strength                 
              concrete structures, thus increasing the safety in engineering                 
              design applications.
