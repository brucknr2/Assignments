Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Forest regeneration is dependent on the successful growth of                   
              individual trees, which are directly affected by soil nitrogen                 
              availability.  Soil nitrogen is heterogeneously distributed, both              
              in terms of ammonium:nitrate ratio and total quantity.  Previous               
              work has shown that black birch seedlings perform differently                  
              when fed nitrate in comparison with ammonium, and that this                    
              response varies with rate of nitrogen supplied and light level.                
              Using a split pot design to create patches of different ammonium               
              to nitrate ration, the investigators will examine whether black                
              birch seedlings forage selectively for nitrate or ammonium in                  
              soil.  By using labelled 15NO3, they will test whether roots                   
              actually prefer to acquire ammonium, and whether preference for a              
              given form of nitrogen is dependent upon the ratio of ammonium to              
              nitrate in a patch, the rate of nitrogen supply and light                      
              availability.  Lastly, the investigators will examine whether the              
              ratio of total non-structural carbohydrates: free amino acids in               
              the leaves is a good predictor of whole plant partitioning of                  
              biomass.
