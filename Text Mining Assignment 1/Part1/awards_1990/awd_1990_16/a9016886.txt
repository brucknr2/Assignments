Abstract    :
                   Fast atomic beam separated oscillatory field radiofrequency               
              spectroscopy is used to measure the fine structure of H, D, and                
              He; molecular-beam laser spectroscopy is used to study the                     
              structure and decay mechanism for triplet Rydberg states of H2,                
              HD, and D2; and various laser spectroscopy techniques are used to              
              study the 2S1 - 2P0,1,2 interval in He3 and He4.  The spectroscopy             
              involves invention and development of very advanced high                       
              resolution techniques, and leads to definitive tests of quantum                
              electrodynamics.
