Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Description:  This project provides partial support for 10                     
              U.S. scientists to participate in an International Workshop                    
              on Lasers in Science and Technology, scheduled to be held                      
              in Amman, Jordan, in October 1991.  The topics will involve                    
              laser radiation, and include: basic atomic, molecular and                      
              optical physics; atomic spectroscopy and applications;                         
              molecular spectroscopy of systems that are of importance to                    
              physical chemistry, inorganic chemistry, and biochemistry;                     
              laser-induced reactive and non-reactive chemistry, and                         
              photochemical processes; laser chemical analysis, and laser                    
              induced ionization and fluorescence; laser-produced                            
              plasmas; laser-surface interaction; small accelerator                          
              physics; and biomedical applications of lasers.  In                            
              addition to contributed scientific and technological                           
              papers, there will be a small number of talks of general                       
              character to suit the interdisciplinary audience.                              
              Participants are expected from the U.S., several European                      
              countries, India, Pakistan, China, the USSR, and all Arab                      
              countries as well as Iran and Turkey.  Proceedings of the                      
              workshop will be published.                                                    
                                                                                             
              Scope: The aims of the workshop include: (1) providing a                       
              forum for scientists and researchers from the region to                        
              present the results of their research and to hear from                         
              active foreign researchers about their recent work. (2)                        
              working by Arab and other Middle East scientists to plan                       
              for a laser research center with help from the expertise of                    
              U.S. and European participants. and (3) planning for                           
              collaboration between the U.S. and Middle East countries.                      
              These aims are well within the goals of the Science in                         
              Developing Countries Program.
