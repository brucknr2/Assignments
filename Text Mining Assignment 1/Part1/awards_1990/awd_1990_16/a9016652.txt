Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Morphological data have not provided a clear picture of the                    
              relationships among species of the Desmognathinae a monophyletic               
              subfamily of lungless salamanders, family Plethodontidae.                      
              Preliminary data on rDNA restriction site variation and published              
              data from other vertebrate groups indicate that rDNA restriction               
              site mapping can generate valuable new phylogenetic information                
              for desmognathines.  Use of the sister group relationship between              
              the Desmognathinae and the Plethodontinae will allow application               
              of the outgroup criterion for ascertaining primitive versus                    
              derived restriction sites, and a phylogenetic hypothesis will be               
              formulated based ont he most parsimonious explanation of                       
              restriction site evolution.  Phylogenetic information from rDNA                
              can provide the basis for the testing of pervious hypotheses of                
              life history evolution in desmognathines and can be used to                    
              determine the ancestral life history for desmognathines, an                    
              important consideration in testing competing hypotheses on the                 
              origin of lunglessness in the Plethodontidae.  This study is the               
              first investigation of the entire rDNA array in a monophyletic                 
              group of salamanders and will increase knowledge of rDNA                       
              evolution in vertebrates.
