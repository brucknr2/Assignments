Abstract    :
                   This Special Minority Award provides a third year of                      
              support for Gloria Carrillo, a graduate student in physics at                  
              the University of Minnesota.  With the completion of formal                    
              academic requirements (expected in Fall, 1990), Ms Carrillo                    
              will be ready to devote full time to research in pursuit of her                
              Ph.D.  This award is an integral part of the strategy of the                   
              National Science Foundation to strengthen and increase minority                
              participation in the field of physics.
