Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary objective of this U.S.-Poland research                             
              project between Dr. Philip Goode of the New Jersey                             
              Institute of Technology and Dr. Wojciech Dziembronski of                       
              the Copernicus Astronomical Center is to use helioseismic                      
              data to determine the stability of the internal rotation                       
              and magnetism of the Sun.  The researchers intend to                           
              relate this degree of stability to the properties of the                       
              dynamo during the solar surface activity cycle.                                
              Additionally, the work will emphasize use of similar                           
              seismic data to learn more about Ap star magnetic fields                       
              and the origin of such stars' spectral properties.  The                        
              combined results of the work will build upon our                               
              knowledge of the seismology of slowly rotating,                                
              nonmagnetic Ap stars and should contribute to better                           
              developed solar and stellar evolution models.                                  
                                                                                             
              The project in stellar evolution fulfills the program                          
              objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling                        
              leading experts in the United States and Eastern Europe                        
              to combine complementary talents and pool research                             
              resources in areas of strong mutual interest and                               
              competence.
