Abstract    :
              This State-of-the-Art survey award will send a team from the                   
              Engineering Design Research Center (EDRC) at Carnegie Mellon                   
              University, organized by Dr. Georgette Demes, to Japan to expose               
              the team members to design practice in five key industries in                  
              which EDRC research has the broadest application.  The team will               
              spend two days at each site, touring and asking a battery of                   
              questions sent ahead.  The team believes that design research in               
              Japan is most advanced in Japanese industry and that their center              
              (EDRC) should play a role in transmitting such information about               
              Japanese research to American industry.
