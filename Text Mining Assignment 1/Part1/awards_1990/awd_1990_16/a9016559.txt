Abstract    :
              This award will support collaborative research in                              
              applications of information theory in statistics                               
              between Dr. D. V. Gokhale of the University of                                 
              California, Riverside and Dr. Ruben Klein of the                               
              Labratorio Nacional da Computacion Cientifica (LNCC),                          
              Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The specific areas are                                 
              discrete data analysis including contingency tables;                           
              design analysis of questionnaires; approximations to                           
              density and distribution functions; and estimation of                          
              parameters under specified constraints.                                        
                                                                                             
              A unique feature of the proposal is that it will                               
              enable the interaction of several prominent                                    
              researchers from the U.S. and Brazil with expertise in                         
              information theory and statistics to continue an on-                           
              going collaboration.
