Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Generalized host/pathogen models have shown that pathogens can                 
              theoretically regulate host population dynamics, as well as have               
              evolutionary impacts.  At the same time, there has been little or              
              no work done to measure ecological or evolutionary relationships               
              between hosts and pathogens outside of human epidemiology or                   
              agricultural crop systems.                                                     
                                                                                             
              The major goals of this proposal are 1) to develop population                  
              dynamic models relevant to plant host/pathogen systems, 2) to                  
              extend the theory to examine the effects of genetics on                        
              population dynamics, 3) to develop models that explore                         
              evolutionary impacts of pathogens on host life histories, 4) to                
              experimentally determine the effects of density dependence in                  
              Silene populations, and 5) to establish long term experimental                 
              populations that allow model assumptions to be tested, thus                    
              acting as a guide to future theory development.
