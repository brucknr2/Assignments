Abstract    :
                   This award is to provide partial travel support                           
              for approximately 15 young American scientists to attend the                   
              22ndInternational Ethological Conference to be held in Kyoto,                  
              Japan. This International Ethological Conference is the first to               
              be heldin Asia and is open to all who are interested in ethology               
              and itsrelated disciplines.  This conference is the only                       
              internationalgathering which brings together scientists studying               
              all aspectsof animal behavior, including mechanisms, development,              
              evolution,and adaptiveness.  With the inclusion of scientists                  
              from over 40countries there will be an enormous sharing of                     
              scientific ideasfrom which younger scientists will benefit.                    
              Large issues such asglobal change and the ecology of the planet                
              earth will certainlybe on the agenda and our young scientists                  
              will profit from theexchanges which will take place.
