Abstract    :
              This award will support research on the mathematics of                         
              disordered systems to be conducted by Abel Klein of the                        
              University of California at Irvine in cooperation with J.                      
              Fernando Perez and Henrique von Dreifus from the University                    
              of Sao Paulo, Brazil.  They will investigate phenomena in                      
              two types of disordered systems:  quantum spin systems with                    
              disorder and random Schrodinger operators.  Quantum spin                       
              systems with random parameters have been introduced to study                   
              the effect of impurities in several physical systems.                          
              Examples of such systems are given by quantum X - Y, Heisenberg                
              and Ising models in the presence of a random transverse                        
              field.  These models are related to superfluidity and                          
              superconductivity.                                                             
                                                                                             
              The study of disordered quantum systems that exhibit zero-                     
              temperature transitions is a new and exciting area of                          
              research in Mathematical Physics.  In such models, one has to                  
              treat the combined effects of randomness and quantum                           
              fluctuations.  Such combination has hardly been studied in                     
              the Physics literature or in Mathematical Physics.  Such study                 
              is a long range goal of this research proposal.
