Abstract    :
              This research involves the study of the optical transmission                   
              properties of high temperature superconductors, using free standing            
              ultrathin single crystals and the exceptionally bright infrared                
              radiation available at the National Synchrotron Light Source at                
              Brookhaven.  A major part of the research will be devoted to sample            
              preparation and characterization, including structural and                     
              transport measurements carried out at Stony Brook.  The objectives             
              of the present investigation are to elucidate the nature of the                
              superconducting energy gap in these compounds, and to study the                
              optically active elementary excitations in the normal and                      
              superconducting states.  The optical reflectivity of these                     
              materials is unusual and complex and transmission studies have an              
              inherent advantage of better accuracy at low frequencies.                      
              Materials with magnetic and non-magnetic dopants, with irradiation             
              induced defects, and with various level of oxygen deficiency will              
              be prepared and investigated.  Studies will also be made of                    
              reference samples of conventional superconductors and quasi two-               
              dimensional metals.
