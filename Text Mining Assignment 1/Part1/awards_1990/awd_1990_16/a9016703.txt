Abstract    :
                   This project will support three workshops to encourage and                
              support young women mathematicians.  The first workshop will be                
              held in conjunction with the twentieth anniversary celebration of              
              the Association for Women in Mathematics (AWM) at the Joint                    
              Meeting of the American Mathematical Society (AMS) and the                     
              Mathematical Association of America (MAA) in January 1991.  Part               
              of the program will consist of an AWM Symposium entitled "The                  
              Future of Women in Mathematics;" this symposium will involve                   
              approximately ten recent doctoral recipients who will present                  
              thirty minute talks on their research.  The other planned                      
              activities will run concurrently with the Joint Meeting.  The                  
              other two workshops will be held prior to major mathematical                   
              meetings in 1992; the first at the Joint Mathematics Meeting                   
              (January 1992) and the second at the national meeting of the                   
              Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (July 1992).                    
              These workshops will bring together women who are recent doctoral              
              recipients or graduate students in mathematics, and several                    
              established mathematicians.  The workshop participants will be                 
              expected to give a brief presentation on their research interests              
              and research environment.  It is expected that the opportunity to              
              meet and interact with one another, as well as with a few                      
              established mathematicians, will enable the participants to                    
              promote their own research and decrease their professional                     
              isolation.
