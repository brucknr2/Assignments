Abstract    :
                 The principal investigators (PI) will conduct research on the               
              transmission of video signals over fiber optic ATM based networks.             
              The emphasis in on the impact that video service with its coding,              
              synchronization and error recovery mechanisms and the ATM network              
              with its multiplexing/switching, scheduling/ prioritization and                
              control schemes will have on each other.  The research will address            
              coding issues, video/ATM networking interfaces and network control.            
              They will investigate motion compensation for three-dimensional                
              subband coding and transform coding, as a vehicle for temporal data            
              conversion, error concealment and compression enhancement. They                
              will also consider non-separable filter banks used in subband                  
              coders.  A major portion of the research will be the study of the              
              interface between the video coder and the network. This will                   
              include examining the relationship between video services, coding              
              schemes, and the statistics of the output streams of the  various              
              variable bit rate codecs.  The research will result in the design              
              and development of a packetizer/ depacketizer to be used in                    
              conjunction with the coding schemes. Network control will include              
              exploring the effect that mechanisms such as prioritization,                   
              scheduling and flow control will have on video services.
