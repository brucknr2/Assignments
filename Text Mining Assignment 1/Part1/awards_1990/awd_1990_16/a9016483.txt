Abstract    :
              We propose the acquisition of a 600 MHz NMR spectrometer.   The                
              research proposed for the new instrument will improve our                      
              capability for determining high-resolution protein and nucleic                 
              acid structures in solution from two-dimensional NMR experiments               
              and will improve our ability to elucidate protein and nucleic                  
              acid complexes.  The most effective means of deriving nucleic                  
              acid and protein solution structure by using the complete                      
              relaxation matrix analysis of 2D NOE spectra to obtain numerous                
              internuclear distances and scalar-coupling-based 2D NMR                        
              experiments to yield torsion angle constraints, in conjunction                 
              with the computational techniques of distance geometry, molecular              
              mechanics and restrained molecular dynamics will be explored.                  
              Reverse-detection heteronuclear 2D NMR experiments will enable                 
              resonance assignments and structural insights.  The improved                   
              capabilities should also aid in our studies of ligand binding to               
              biopolymers, thus leading to greater mechanistic insights.
