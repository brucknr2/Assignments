Abstract    :
                   Fractal geometery permits the description of many complex                 
              natural phenomena using a few relatively simple equations.  At                 
              least three methods to generate fractal models have been                       
              developed to the degree that they can be applied to biological                 
              questions of ecological significance:  fractal set theory,                     
              iterated function systems (IFS), and Lindenmayer systems (L-                   
              systems).  Plant roots, fungi and soil pore spaces all have                    
              fractal properties; hence fractal methods appear to be suitable                
              for the study of interactions between plant roots, the soil and                
              soil microorganisms.  The aim of the proposed research it to                   
              develop methods for modelling these interactions, to facilitate                
              research into the plant root-soil ecosystem.  Work in progress at              
              the P.I.'s  laboratory has shown the common species of soil fungi              
              have patterns of mycelial branching that are fractal, and that                 
              these patterns can be modelled for up to 5 days after spore                    
              germination using L-systems.  L-systems appear to work equally                 
              well for geometrically simple root systems, such as those of pea.              
              These methods will be extended to other systems, and methods for               
              modelling of the interaction between roots and soil                            
              microorganisms that are based on fractal representation will be                
              developed.  The methods will be tested by comparing them to                    
              laboratory measurements of fungus-root interactions.  These type               
              on interactions are broadly important in virtually all                         
              terrestrial environments, including many endangered habitats.
