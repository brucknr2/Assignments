Abstract    :
                   This research is part of an on-going program by the                       
              principal investigator and associates.  Topics in the following                
              areas are to be considered:  (1)  controlled Markov diffusions                 
              and nonlinear PDEs; (2) asymptotic properties of nearly                        
              deterministic Markov processes; (3) financial economics                        
              applications; (4) singular stochastic control; (5) computational               
              methods in stochastic control; (6) stochastic calculus of                      
              variations; (7) nonlinear estimation.  Analytical methods based                
              on viscosity solution techniques for nonlinear differential                    
              equations as well as probabilistic methods will be studied.                    
              These theoretical studies are the basis for applied problems                   
              ranging from decisions at the stock market level to the control                
              of spaceships.
