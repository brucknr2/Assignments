Abstract    :
              This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                
              award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to the                
              University of Michigan Ann Arbor for the renovation and repair of              
              the C. C. Little Building which houses the x-ray mineralogical,                
              paleomagnetic and rock magnetic, mineral separation, and                       
              seismological/geodynamics research and research training                       
              activities of the Department of Geological Sciences.  This                     
              building was constructed in 1920 and last renovated in 1970.  The              
              ARFMP grant of $350,000 and $353,570 provided by the grantee as                
              cost sharing will be used to modernize these research and research             
              training facilities.  This project will address the need to improve            
              the current research infrastructure by reconfiguring it so that it             
              is more efficient and by providing adequate power and fume exhaust             
              systems and environmental controls and computer network                        
              connectivity necessary for safe and reliable research operations.              
                                                                                             
              This award contributes to the infrastructure of science and                    
              engineering by providing an improved environment for the conduct               
              of research and for the training of quality undergraduate and                  
              graduate students.  Also the laboratories to be modernized in this             
              project serve as a focus for postdoctoral programs and                         
              collaborative and cooperative research with university and                     
              industry throughout the nation and as an informal regional and                 
              national center for many types of instrument-intensive research in             
              geology.
