Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The proposed four-month planning grant will create an                          
              interinstitutional consortium known as the Southwest                           
              Minority Alliance.  The Alliance will develop a five-year                      
              plan to implement a series of recommendations from recent                      
              national reports focusing on minority participation in                         
              science and engineering at the undergraduate and graduate                      
              levels.  Five components will initially serve as                               
              cornerstones of the Alliance:                                                  
                                                                                             
              1.)  Formation of institutional consortium to pool counseling                  
                   and transitional support resources from high school to                    
                   undergraduate school to graduate school;                                  
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
              2.)  Development of clear articulation agreements to offer                     
                   binding transfer from one participating institution to                    
                   another;                                                                  
                                                                                             
              3.)  Operation of residential summer science and academies                     
                   for students beginning at the seventh-grade level to                      
                   enrich science knowledge and experience;                                  
                                                                                             
              4.)  Establishment of a freshman-year, college-based program                   
                   to increase student participation and opportunities for                   
                   success in undergraduate programs in science and                          
              engineering;                                                                   
                                                                                             
              5.)  Involvement of the private sector in educational                          
              enhancement activities such as tutoring, mentoring, and                        
              advising minority students.                                                    
                                                                                             
              During the four-month planning period the Southwest Minority                   
              Alliance will create and mobilized the infrastructure                          
              necessary to carry each of these components forward during                     
              the implementation phase.  The Alliance members will                           
              devise innovative means to increase the retention and                          
              baccalaureate acquisition rates of minority students                           
              interested in science and engineering careers.
