Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The expression, regulation and function of various forms of the                
              extracellular matrix molecule, tenascin, will be studied.                      
              Tenascin appears to be a molecule important to cellular migration              
              in the developing nervous system, but its role is poorly                       
              understood.  Molecular probes will be used for in situ                         
              hybridization to tissue sections and neural cultures to study the              
              cellular expression of tenascin variants.  Possible regulation of              
              tenascin expression by peptide growth factors will be studied by               
              Northern blot analysis.  Effects on cell proliferation, migration              
              and differentiation will be studied by time-lapse videomicroscopy              
              in cells cultured with tenascin variants, antibodies to tenascin,              
              deglycosylated tenascin and peptides that block tenascin binding.
