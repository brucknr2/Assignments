Abstract    :
              This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                
              award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to                    
              Worcester Polytechnic Institute for the renovation and repair of               
              the Washburn Building which houses the Mechanical Engineering                  
              Department's ceramics and powder metallurgical processing research             
              and research training activities.  This building was constructed in            
              1897 and last renovated in 1956.  The ARFMP grant of $175,000 and              
              $185,000 provided by the grantee as cost sharing will be used to               
              modernize these research and research training facilities and to               
              consolidate currently dispersed research and research training                 
              activities so that their synergistic potential may be more fully               
              realized.  This project will address the need to improve current               
              research infrastructure by placing all research and research                   
              training activities in a central location and by further                       
              reconfiguring the space, with each laboratory module optimized for             
              its specific research and research training functions.                         
                                                                                             
              This award contributes to the infrastructure of science and                    
              engineering by providing an improved environment for the conduct               
              of research and for the training of quality undergraduate and                  
              graduate students.  Students trained in these laboratories are in              
              demand in both basic and applied research fields.
