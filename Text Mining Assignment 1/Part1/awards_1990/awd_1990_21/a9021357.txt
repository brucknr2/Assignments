Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                            
              A four-week workshop on properties of feature organization, will               
              be held concurrently with the 1991 Linguistic Institute at the                 
              University of California at Santa Cruz.  The objective is to                   
              explore some of the important issues in the theory of segment-                 
              internal structure.  In particular, the workshop will address (i)              
              the motivation for feature groupings and their formal expression,              
              and (ii) the central role of the strictly local relations of                   
              dependency and sisterhood between segment components.  The four-               
              week workshop (July 8 through August 2) will be a closed working               
              group of approximately fifteen participants, representing                      
              different backgrounds and orientations but who have all                        
              contributed to the investigation of segment-internal feature                   
              representation.  The one-day conference will be open to the whole              
              Institute community, and an edited collection of papers from the               
              workshop and conference will be published.
