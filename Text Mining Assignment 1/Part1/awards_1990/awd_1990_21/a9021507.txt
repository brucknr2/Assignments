Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project explores the potential of narrow bandgap                          
              semiconductors such as rhenium(Rh) molybdenum(Mo) silicide for use             
              as a silicon microelectronics compatible wavelength adjustable                 
              infrared sensitive detector material.  Determining the                         
              compositional (Rh, Mo) dependence of the bandgap value, and the                
              influence of epitaxial crystal growth parameters on the                        
              microstructure of the films are major goals.  Thin films of Rh and             
              Mo will be deposited in stoichiometric proportions by e-beam                   
              evaporation onto silicon substrates.  Silicide formation will be               
              completed through thermally driven solid state reactions by two                
              distinct modes--reactive deposition epitaxy, and solid phase                   
              epitaxy.  The films will be evaluated by electron and x-ray                    
              spectroscopies, and the type of bandgap and its value will be                  
              determined by comparing optical data to theoretical models.  This              
              work, by providing information on fundamental materials synthesis,             
              processing, and physical properties, is expected to lay the                    
              foundation for development of monolithically integrated silicon                
              based intrinsic infrared detector prototypes suitable for use in               
              the 8-14 micron wavelength range.
