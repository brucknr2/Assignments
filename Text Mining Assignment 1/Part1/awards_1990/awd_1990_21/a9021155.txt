Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Thy-1 is a member of the immunoglobulin supergene family that                  
              codes for a cell surface recognition molecule that is expressed                
              only in the immune and nervous systems.  The function of Thy-1 is              
              unknown.  Transgenic mice will be developed to study the function              
              and cellular expression of Thy-1 in the developing nervous                     
              system.  Genetic techniques to make mutant embryonic stem cells                
              lacking the Thy-1.2 allele will be used to make transgenic mice                
              lacking expression of Thy-1.  These mice will be used to study                 
              the role of this protein in neural development.  In addition,                  
              transgenic mice containing a marker protein whose expression is                
              directed by the Thy-1 promoter will be used to study the lineages              
              of cells that express Thy-1 in the neuroepithelium.
