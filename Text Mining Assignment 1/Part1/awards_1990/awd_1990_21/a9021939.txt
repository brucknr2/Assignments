Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The proposed research is a study of the relationship between                   
              processing, microstructure, and cyclic fatigue behavior in zirconia            
              ceramics. Specifically, the objective of the research is first, to             
              understand the mechanism of cyclic fatigue in these transformation             
              toughened materials, and second, to control this mechanism through             
              processing related changes in the microstructure. A number of in-              
              house processed ceria partially stabilized zirconia/alumina                    
              composites will be used in the study to investigate the role of                
              crack shielding and the effects of composition, microstructure, and            
              environment on cyclic fatigue crack propagation. Theoretical                   
              calculations on toughening by such mechanisms as transformation                
              zone shielding and crack bridging will also be conducted. It is                
              expected that the results will have a significant impact on our                
              understanding of cyclic fatigue in polycrystalline ceramic                     
              materials.
