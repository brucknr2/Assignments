Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Regulation and determination of cell fate are fundamental to                   
              development. Identification of selector genes in Drosophila                    
              allows description of these elusive phenomena in terms of gene                 
              expression. Expression of a particular selector gene selects a                 
              particular pathway of development. Selector gene expression must               
              change when cells change their fate in response to environment                 
              (regulation), whereas selector gene expression must be stably                  
              maintained when a cell and its progeny are committed to a pathway              
              of development (determined). Expression of engrailed, a selector               
              gene, commits cells to the posterior compartment of a segment,                 
              but expression is not initially stable. Cell-cell signalling in                
              very young embryos appears to represent regulative control of                  
              engrailed expression. Subsequently, engrailed expression appears               
              to be stabilized as it comes under the influence of two later                  
              tiers of control. As a paradigm for the processes of regulation                
              and determination, Dr. O'Farrell is examining engrailed                        
              expression. He will define when and where determination of                     
              engrailed expression occurs. He will explore the involvement of                
              autoregulation and candidate "maintenance genes" in the                        
              stabilization of engrailed expression. He will map engrailed                   
              regulatory sequences that mediate regulative and determinative                 
              programs of expression. From this base he will study the                       
              molecular mechanisms of regulation and determination in                        
              development.
