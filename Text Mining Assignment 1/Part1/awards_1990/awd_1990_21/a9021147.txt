Abstract    :
                The Winter Gordon Research Conference on Fibronectin and Related             
              Macromolecules will be held February 11-15, 1991, on Oxnard,                   
              California.  Fibronectin and related macromolecules are involved               
              in many basic functions of cells and tissues, impacting on                     
              embryogenesis, tissue organization, hemostasis, wound healing,                 
              the immune system, hematopoeisis, and other normal life                        
              processes.  The recent progress in this area has been explosive.               
              The challenge to the field over the next several years is to                   
              comprehend, organize, and make use of this large amount of new                 
              information.  This conference will bring together research                     
              leaders in diverse aspects of the structure and function of                    
              fibronectin and related macromolecules, and will serve as a                    
              valuable forum to present and discuss new information, identify                
              problem areas, and plan new approaches.
