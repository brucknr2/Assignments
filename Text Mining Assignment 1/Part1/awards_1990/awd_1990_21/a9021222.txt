Abstract    :
              Current techniques for a software engineer to change a computer                
              program are limited to static activities - once the application begins         
              executing, there are few reliable ways to reconfigure it.  Having a            
              sound method for managing changes in a running program will allow              
              developers to perform maintenance activities without loss of the               
              overall system's service.  The objective of this project is to study           
              how to reconfigurate application software dynamically.  This project           
              will create an environment for organizing and effecting software               
              reconfiguration activities dynamically, develop a formal approach for          
              programmers to capture the state of a process abstractly, and                  
              investigate methods for adapting software to be reconfigurable.
