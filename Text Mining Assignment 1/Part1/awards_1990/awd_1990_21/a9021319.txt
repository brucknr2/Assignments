Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              Anger is a basic human emotion which typically occurs when                     
              control of outcomes is lost or goals are thwarted.  Anger                      
              expressions are observed even in 2- to 8- month old infants in                 
              such contexts.  Yet, individual differences in the pattern of                  
              anger/frustration are seen.  Some infants show only anger when                 
              control of an expected event is disrupted, others show a mixture               
              of anger and sad expressions, while still others show only                     
              sadness.  The project will examine empirically two aspects of the              
              early anger response.  First, the project will study the                       
              conditions  under which loss of control of outcomes elicits anger              
              early in life.  Of particular interest is how the anger response               
              may vary when loss of control is only partial.   Secondly, the                 
              project will explore the relation of early parental                            
              responsiveness and temperament factors to individual differences               
              in infant anger expression.  Thus, the research will establish                 
              the basic dynamics of early anger in response to frustrating                   
              events, including its origins in socialization and constitutional              
              factors.
