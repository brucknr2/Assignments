Abstract    :
                      The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office will provide data to              
              extend and expand existing data series concerning patenting in                 
              the United States.  Data will include numbers of patents granted               
              year by year to Americans and to citizens of other specified                   
              countries, patents owned by individuals as opposed to private                  
              corporate entities, governments, and patents assigned to univer-               
              sities and colleges.  Counts of granted patents will be                        
              classified by both the Patent Office Classification system and                 
              the Standard Industrial Classification system.                                 
                      These data are used in the National Science Board's series             
              of Science and Engineering Indicators reports as indicators of                 
              levels of technical invention in the various countries, sectors,               
              and fields.
