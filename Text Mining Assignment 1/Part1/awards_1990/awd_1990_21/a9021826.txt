Abstract    :
              This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                
              award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to Saint              
              Michael's College for the renovation and repair of Cheray Science              
              Hall which houses research and research training activities in                 
              the Departments of Biology, Chemistry, Physics, and in the                     
              interdisciplinary majors in Biochemistry and Environmental                     
              Science.  This building was constructed in 1949 and has not been               
              renovated since that time.  The ARFMP grant of $375,000 and                    
              $1,046,511 provided by the grantee as cost sharing will be used                
              to modernize these research and research training facilities.                  
              This project will address the need to improve the current                      
              research infrastructure by reconfiguring the space and upgrading               
              the electrical power and heating, ventilation, and air                         
              conditioning (HVAC) systems.  These modifications will permit an               
              increase in the continuity and quality, quantity, and diversity                
              of the scientific research conducted as well as insure that                    
              current health and safety standards are met.                                   
                                                                                             
              This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                     
              providing an improved environment for the conduct of research and              
              for the training of undergraduate students in an institution                   
              where a large percentage of science majors go on to pursue                     
              graduate study.
