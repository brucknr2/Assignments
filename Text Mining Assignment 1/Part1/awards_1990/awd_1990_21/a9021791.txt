Abstract    :
              This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                
              award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to the                
              University of Washington for the conversion of the Chemistry                   
              Library Building into the Environmental Chemistry Facility which               
              will house interdisciplinary research and research training in                 
              atmospheric and environmental chemistry, encompassing a                        
              coordinated program of research in critical aspects of                         
              biogeochemistry and global climate change.  This building was                  
              constructed in 1957 and last renovated in 1988.  The ARFMP grant               
              of $225,000 and $335,155 provided by the grantee as cost sharing               
              will be used to modernize these research and research training                 
              facilities providing a centrally located focus for campus-wide                 
              disciplinary strengths in the earth and natural sciences.  This                
              project will address the need to improve the current research                  
              infrastructure by means of a major upgrading and expansion of the              
              existing ventilation system, including the addition of air                     
              conditioning, and redistributing or modifying the power and                    
              electrical systems on a room by room basis.                                    
                                                                                             
              This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                     
              providing an improved environment for the conduct of a new                     
              coordinated program of research of national importance in critical             
              aspects of biogeochemistry and global climate change under the                 
              aegis of faculty from Chemistry, Atmospheric Sciences, and                     
              Oceanography and for the training of quality undergraduate and                 
              graduate students.
