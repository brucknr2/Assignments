Abstract    :
                   The peccaries (Artiodactyla:  Tayassuidae) are a family of                
              ungulates with extreme specializations of the nasal passages.  In              
              particular, their noses contain a complex of inflated bony                     
              structures found nowhere else among the mammals.  The functions                
              of these structures are completely unknown.  One difficulty in                 
              arriving at a functional interpretation is that little is known                
              about the functional morphology of the vertebrate respiratory                  
              system.  The proposed research is both a systematic investigation              
              of possible functions of the peccary nasal apparatus and general               
              analysis of mammalian respiratory mechanics.  The principal                    
              investigators will test the hypothesis that the peccary                        
              structures are involved in olfaction by histological and                       
              ultrastructural study of the nasal epithelia.  They will assess                
              whether the structures function as part of a brain-cooling                     
              mechanism by elucidating the anatomy of the nasal vasculature.                 
              They will use mathematical modeling and an experimental flow                   
              apparatus to test whether the structures are associated with a                 
              mechanism for exchanging heat or water with the environment, and               
              also to investigate if they could be used to remove particles                  
              from a dust-laden atmosphere.
