Abstract    :
              This grant supports the work of Ms. Maureen Ogle, who, under the               
              direction of Dr. Marcus, is undertaking dissertation research on               
              "Private Spaces, Public Health:  A Social and Technological History            
              of American Household Plumbing, 1840-1900."  This is a study of                
              American household plumbing that focuses on (1) the technology of              
              household sanitation and changes in technology in the nineteenth               
              century; and (2) the relationship between technology and its social            
              and cultural context.  Ms. Ogle is examining nineteenth century                
              architects' working plans (blueprints) housed at the Society for               
              the Preservation of New England Antiquities and at the Boston                  
              Public Library.  She is also examining the extensive holdings of               
              municipal documents, ordinances, and reports related to public                 
              health held at the National Library of Medicine, the Library of                
              Congress and the Boston Public Library.  This promises to be an                
              ideal examination of the way culture and technological innovation              
              interact in America.
