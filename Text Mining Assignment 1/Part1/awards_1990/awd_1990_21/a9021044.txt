Abstract    :
                   Previous work on measurements of total and differential                   
              cross sections for positron scattering on atoms will be                        
              extended.  In addition there will be three directions for the                  
              research, namely:                                                              
                   1. Measurements of excitation cross sections for alkali                   
              atoms.                                                                         
                   2. A measurement of the positronium formation cross                       
              section.                                                                       
                   3. A search for resonances in positron-atom collisions                    
              which have been predicted theoretically, but have not yet been                 
              observed.
