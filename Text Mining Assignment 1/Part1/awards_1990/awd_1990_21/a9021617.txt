Abstract    :
              This ia a two-year collaborative research project between Dr.                  
              Frank Tabakin, University of Pittsburgh, Dr. S. T. Lee,                        
              Argonne National Laboratory and Professor Yang Shin Nan,                       
              Taiwan National University supported by the AIT-(US) CCNAA-                    
              (Taiwan) Cooperative Science Program.  This proposal plans to                  
              study electroproduction of mesons and nucleon resonances.                      
              Dr. Tabakin has a three year award from the Theoretical                        
              Physics Program on antinucleon-nucleon and electroproduction                   
              reactions.  The proposed research activity adds an internati-                  
              onal dimension to his existing NSF award.                                      
                                                                                             
              This proposed study has two major parts:  the study of the                     
              mesonic dynamics in the outer region of a hadron and the                       
              investigation of the quark dynamics of electromagnetic                         
              production of mesons and nucleon resonances.  This is an                       
              important field of theoretical physics.  The principal                         
              investigators are noted researchers in this field and can                      
              make a significant progress in this field of study.  This                      
              project is jointly supported by the NSF and the Taiwan                         
              National Science Council.
