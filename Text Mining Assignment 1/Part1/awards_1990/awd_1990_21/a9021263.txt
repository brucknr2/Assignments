                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                            
              This project is aimed at developing a better understanding of the              
              discourse properties of the Seneca language, a Native American                 
              language whose grammatical and discourse patterns are maximally                
              different from those of English and other more familiar                        
              languages.  The study will be based on extensive tape-recorded                 
              samples of the Seneca language, presently spoken by about 200                  
              people in western New York State, recordings that will also                    
              provide a permanent record of the language for present and future              
              generations of the Seneca people.  The number of speakers of                   
              Seneca is rapidly diminishing, and knowledge of how the language               
              is used under natural circumstances by the last generation of                  
              fully fluent speakers must be obtained now or never.                           
                                                                                             
              The project will combine the expertise of a linguist experienced               
              in work with the Seneca language, whose primary theoretical                    
              interest is in discourse phenomena, and a Seneca speaker who has               
              been actively involved in pedagogical and descriptive work on her              
              language, whose other projects have put her in close touch with                
              people from whom recordings can be obtained.  The project will                 
              test hypotheses developed so far largely on the basis of English               
              data, confirming or modifying them on the basis of data from a                 
              typologically distinct language.
