Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Vocal communication in vertebrate animals is one behavior                 
              that displays sexually dimorphic characteristics (i.e., males and              
              females are different).  Dr. Bass has chosen to study teleost                  
              fishes as a model system of this type of behavior.  In the                     
              species to be studied males generate vocalizations in order to                 
              attract females to the nest, but no such behavior is seen in the               
              females.  In previous studies it has been shown that the                       
              behavioral sex differences in vocalizations are correlated with                
              anatomical and physiological traits of the muscles and neurons                 
              that comprise the sonic motor pathway.  The proposed research                  
              will study the underlying basis of these differences.  The                     
              electrophysiological properties of the nerve cells involved in                 
              these responses will be analysed.  The morphological features and              
              the chemical nature of specific nerve cells in this system will                
              be identified.  Changes induced by testosterone, a reproductively              
              active steroid hormone, will be measured both physiologically and              
              anatomically.  These studies will contribute to fundamental                    
              knowledge about the role of steroid hormones in the regulation of              
              nerve cell function and sexually differentiated behaviors in                   
              vertebrates.
