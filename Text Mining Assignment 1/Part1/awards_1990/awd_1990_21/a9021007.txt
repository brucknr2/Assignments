Abstract    :
                   Vanderbilt University has been connected to NSFNET for two                
              years, and now has invited five Nashville institutions to share                
              that connection.  Two are historically black, two are small liberal            
              arts institutions that emphasize teaching rather than research, and            
              one is a two-year technological school.  Expected benefits of an               
              NSFNET connection include file transfers, electronic mail                      
              communication between local and remote researchers, and remote                 
              login to and use of supercomputers and other research facilities.              
              In addition, the local institutions have access to Vanderbilt's                
              resources, and add another dimension to the diversity of resources             
              Vanderbilt can offer its students.  Cross-registration, software               
              sharing and other benefits also are expected to result from the                
              proposed network.
