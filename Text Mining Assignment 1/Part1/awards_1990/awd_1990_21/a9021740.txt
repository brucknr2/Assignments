Abstract    :
              This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                
              award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to the                
              University of Maine for the repair and renovation of Murray Hall               
              and Winthrop Libby Hall which house that institution's marine                  
              biological and biological oceanography research and research                   
              training activities.  These buildings were constructed,                        
              respectively, in 1968 and 1962.  Murray Hall has not since been                
              renovated, and Winthrop Libby Hall has been expanded by small                  
              additions in 1965 and 1970, but it has never had any major                     
              renovations since the time of its construction.  The ARFMP grant               
              of $100,000 and $110,550 provided by the grantee as cost sharing               
              will be used to modernize these research and research training                 
              facilities which are under the aegis of a group of highly                      
              productive, collaborative marine zoological researchers.  This                 
              project will address the need to improve the current research                  
              infrastructure both in terms of health and safety and of building              
              systems and the configuration of the space.  The project is                    
              consistent with priorities at the institutional level to expand                
              research and graduate training and to emphasize marine and                     
              biological sciences, at the regional level to expand research                  
              focused on the Gulf of Maine, and at the national level to develop             
              thrusts in application of molecular biology to ocean sciences and              
              in fisheries oceanography.                                                     
                                                                                             
              This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                     
              providing an improved environment for the conduct of research and              
              for the training of quality undergraduate, graduate, and                       
              postdoctoral students.  The professional development of the                    
              faculty and their visiting scientists will also accrue from this               
              renovation.
