              The High-Tc Update newsletter produced by the High-Tc                          
              Superconductivity Information Exchange at Ames Lab provides rapid,             
              reliable information on superconductivity free to subscribers                  
              around the world.  The 16 page newsletter includes extensive                   
              listings of preprints, a preprint review section, selected listings            
              of Soviet Hi-Tc preprints, coming events, resources, news items,               
              and announcements for jobs.
