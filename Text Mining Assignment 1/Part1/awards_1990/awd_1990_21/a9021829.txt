Abstract    :
              This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                
              award from the Research Facilities Office to Yale University                   
              provides funds for the repair and renovation of Sloan Physics                  
              Laboratory which houses that institution's atomic, molecular, and              
              optical physics research and research training activities.  This               
              building was constructed in 1912 and last renovated in 1958.  The              
              ARFMP grant of $950,000 and $1,183,400 provided by the grantee as              
              cost sharing will be used to modernize these research and research             
              training facilities and consolidate several high quality research              
              programs.  The project will address significant disadvantages of               
              the current research infrastructure by providing (a) thermal and               
              vibrational isolation that is absolutely essential to the conduct              
              of high precision experiments,                                                 
              (b) adequate levels of cleanliness, and (c) structurally sound                 
              locations for large magnets and power supplies.  The greater                   
              interactions among related programs that accrue from this                      
              renovation can be expected to enhance collaborations and the                   
              quality of ongoing research.                                                   
                                                                                             
              This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                     
              providing an improved environment for the conduct of research and              
              for the training of quality undergraduate and graduate students.               
              Students trained in these laboratories, where high technology                  
              instruments are developed and used, are in demand in both basic                
              and applied research fields.
