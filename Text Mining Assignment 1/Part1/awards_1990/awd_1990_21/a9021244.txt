Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Skilled movements are thought to be produced by adding together                
              in series a number of simpler movements. In the case of skilled                
              movements of the hands and fingers, simultaneous movements of                  
              both hands are often involved. This project to be conducted by                 
              Dr.John Soechting will use the movements of the hands and fingers              
              during typing as a model for the way in which complex, bimanual                
              movements can be derived by putting together a sequence of                     
              simpler movements. In typing, these simpler movements are the                  
              individual keystrokes and the movment sequence is the series of                
              keystrokes that generate a word or a phrase. The motions of the                
              hands and of the fingers will initially be described for single                
              letters typed in isolation. Then the process of how such                       
              individual movements are put together in series will be studied                
              by asking subjects to type words in which only two letters are                 
              typed by one hand and all other letters are typed with the other               
              hand. Finally, by changing the location of the keys on the                     
              keyboard and forcing typists to relearn the keyboard layout, the               
              processes by which movement sequences are learned will be                      
              studied. This research will contribute to understanding how                    
              individual motor acts are integrated to form coordinated series                
              of movements.
