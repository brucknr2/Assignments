Abstract    :
              Macromolecules are frequently analyzed by size-exclusion                       
              chromatography.  Small molecules are retained in the pores of a                
              stationary medium, while larger molecules directly are eluted.                 
              Prof. Dubin, in a program supported by the Analytical and                      
              Surface Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, is                        
              studying additional factors which effect separations based on                  
              the size-exclusion principle.                                                  
                                                                                             
              Once a molecule enters a pore, it interacts with the surface of                
              the pore in a manner sufficiently complex that current theory                  
              cannot explain the nature of the separation process.   The work                
              to be carried out under this grant will investigate a variety                  
              of physical and chemical interaction mechanisms between                        
              macromolecules and the surface of common porous media, thus                    
              providing a rational basis for the design of size-exclusion                    
              separations of macromolecular mixtures.
