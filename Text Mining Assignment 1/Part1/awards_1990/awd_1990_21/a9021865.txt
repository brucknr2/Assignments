Abstract    :
              This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                
              award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to the                
              University of San Diego for the repair and renovation of Serra                 
              Hall which houses research and research training activities in                 
              biology and electron microscopy.  This building was constructed in             
              1958 and has not been renovated since that time.  The ARFMP grant              
              of $131,000 and $157,248 provided by the grantee as cost sharing               
              will be used to modernize these research and research training                 
              facilities.  This project will address the need to improve the                 
              current research infrastructure by converting four rooms into a                
              multi-use microscopy facility; providing space for preparation of              
              samples, instrument facilities, and three faculty research                     
              laboratories; and upgrading an existing dark room.                             
                                                                                             
              This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                     
              providing an improved environment for the conduct of research and              
              for the training of undergraduate students in a department with a              
              particular commitment to encouraging students to pursue research               
              careers.   This commitment, reflected in the provision of summer               
              research opportunities, clearly defined faculty responsibilities               
              in research training of undergraduates, and a goal of having a                 
              certain percentage of their students enter graduate school, will               
              be further facilitated by this project.
