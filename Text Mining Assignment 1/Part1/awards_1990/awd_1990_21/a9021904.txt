Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Analysis of remotely sensed data, both CZCS and AVHRR will be                  
              used to describe the eddy field in the wake of Barbados Island.                
              These analyses will be combined with in-situ physical                          
              oceanographic data to investigate the dynamics of the island-                  
              generated eddies. Finally this information will be combined with               
              concurrently collected samples of the reef fish to investigate                 
              mechanisms for retention near the island.  This grant is part of               
              a special program at NSF to encourage full participation in the                
              sciences by underrepresented groups; MRI.
