Abstract    :
              The objectives of this project are to identify and                             
              characterize the active sites for hydrogenation reactions on                   
              supported metal catalysts and to determine the dependence of                   
              the concentration and activity of the active sites on the                      
              physical properties of the catalyst.  This involves                            
              determining whether hydrogenation occurs on the oxide support,                 
              the rates of transfer between sites on the metal and on the                    
              oxide, what the limiting steps in the process are, and how                     
              these factors depend on the properties and mode of preparation                 
              of the catalysts.  Temperature-programmed reaction,                            
              temperature-programmed desorption, isotopic labelling,                         
              transient isotope training, and infrared spectroscopy are used                 
              to study multiple reaction sites on supported platinum and                     
              palladium catalysts.  Substrates to be hydrogenated include                    
              adsorbed methoxy and adsorbed organics.  A series of catalyst                  
              preparations is used, with the catalysts characterized by                      
              hydrogen chemisorption, surface-area measurements, X-ray                       
              photoelectron spectroscopy, and atomic absorption.                             
                                                                                             
              This project examines fundamental aspects of hydrogenation                     
              reactions in systems similar to those used in industry.                        
              Although the study is not directed to any particular                           
              application, it could lead to improvement in industrial                        
              hydrogenation in many contexts.  Such processes are common in                  
              the specialty chemical, pharmaceutical, food processing, and                   
              petroleum industries.
