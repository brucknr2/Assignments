Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A nonintrusive optical technique is to be developed for                        
              experimental measurements in sediment-laden flows.  Flow                       
              velocities, particulate velocities, and sediment                               
              concentrations are to be determined.  The instrumentation will                 
              be used in a sediment flume to determine flow characteristics                  
              close to the fluid-sediment bed interface.                                     
                                                                                             
              Increased resolution and refinement in the measurement of                      
              turbulence and sediment characteristics for flow over movable                  
              sediment will permit more realistic modeling and prediction of                 
              flow rates, erosion, and sediment transport in rivers,                         
              channels, and canals.
