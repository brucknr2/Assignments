Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Recent NSF-sponsored experiments indicate that when people talk                
              or write about upsetting experiences in their lives, they become               
              physically and mentally healthier.  For example, individuals who               
              write about personal traumas for four consecutive days for twenty              
              minutes a day evidence improved immune system activity,                        
              reduced physician visits over a 2-4 month interval, and report                 
              being happier and healthier than those who are asked to write                  
              about superficial topics.  The purpose of the present grant is to              
              understand why writing or talking produces such beneficial                     
              effects.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              Over the three years of research, a series of experiments will                 
              explore which dimensions of writing promote health.  Writing                   
              about traumas, for example, may be beneficial because it                       
              organizes the events in people's minds, changes the ways that                  
              people think about the traumas, or perhaps fulfills basic human                
              needs for self-expression.  By pinpointing the health-promoting                
              dimensions of writing, researchers will better understand the                  
              mental processes underlying stressful events and coping.  The                  
              results also have important implications for studying                          
              psychotherapy and interpersonal relationships.
