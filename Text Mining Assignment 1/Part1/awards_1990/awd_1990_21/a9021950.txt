Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports a workshop which assesses the status of                    
              and identifies research needs and opportunities in the                         
              field of intelligent control systems.  Many of the topics                      
              addressed at the meeting have a direct bearing on research                     
              supported by the Dynamic Systems and Control Program as                        
              well as other programs in the Engineering and CISE                             
              directorates.  Specifically, the theory of intelligent                         
              control systems, the formulation and application of                            
              intelligent control systems, knowledge based control                           
              systems, and software/hardware issues for real time                            
              intelligent control are included in the workshop topics.                       
              Support of this proposal satisfies, in part, several key                       
              NSF goals including strengthening cooperation between                          
              industry and university researchers, and aiding in the                         
              transfer of technology from the research level to the                          
              users.  It also represents cooperation between a government                    
              research agency and an independent organization on research                    
              of mutual interest to the two entitles involved.  The                          
              workshop objective is to develop a better understanding of                     
              specific research needs, and to identify specific research                     
              areas whose exploitation will be instrumental in achieving                     
              the full potential of intelligent control systems.
