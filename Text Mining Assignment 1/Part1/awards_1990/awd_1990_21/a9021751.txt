Abstract    :
              This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                
              award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to the                
              University of Idaho for the renovation and repair of Renfrew Hall              
              which houses the research and research training activities of the              
              Department of Chemistry.  This building was constructed in 1963                
              and last renovated in 1981.  The ARFMP grant of $1,300,000 and                 
              $1,948,000 provided by the grantee as cost sharing will be used to             
              modernize these research and research training facilities.  This               
              project will address the need to improve the current research                  
              infrastructure both in terms of current standards of laboratory                
              services and of federal and state safety requirements by upgrading             
              the ventilation, electrical, plumbing, lighting, and fire detection            
              and protection systems.                                                        
                                                                                             
              This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                     
              providing an improved environment for the conduct of research and              
              for the training of quality undergraduate and graduate students in             
              the only Ph.D.-granting chemistry program in the state of Idaho.               
              The ability to train students in these laboratories to meet the                
              future needs of the state and the nation will be markedly enhanced             
              by this renovation.
