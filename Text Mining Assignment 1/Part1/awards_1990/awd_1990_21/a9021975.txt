Abstract    :
              X-ray crystallography of biological macromolecules is an                       
              increasingly important tool to understand structure, function,                 
              and control.  Developments in genetics, data collection, and                   
              computer hardware have produced an unprecedented growth of                     
              crystallographic studies.  X-ray crystallography produces large                
              amounts of data and is entirely dependent upon the availability                
              of powerful computers and sophisticated algorithms for the                     
              interpretation of raw data.  After crystallization, data                       
              collection and phasing, a large variety of computational                       
              procedures are required in order to solve and refine the                       
              structure.  These procedures include methods of phasing, density               
              modification, chain tracing, refinement, and correction of errors              
              in structures.  Recent publication of partially erroneous                      
              structures has drawn everyone's attention to the difficulties                  
              involved at these stages of the crystallographic structure                     
              determination pathway.  It is the goal of this proposal to                     
              develop a comprehensive, machine-independent, and user-friendly                
              program system for all computational aspects of macromolecular                 
              crystallography.  Previous experience with the program X-PLOR                  
              will proved a framework for the proposed software development.                 
              The specifications of the proposed software development are open               
              to discussion at a workshop that has been organized by the                     
              principal investigator and that has been attended by 30 leading                
              researchers in crystallography.  The propose software will                     
              significantly reduce the time required to obtain structures and                
              will increase the reliability of crystallographic structure                    
              determination.
