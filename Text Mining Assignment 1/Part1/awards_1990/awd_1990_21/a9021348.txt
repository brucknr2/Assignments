Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Dr. Balbus will pursue a number of different theoretical studies               
              involving large scale astrophysical gas dynamics.  The                         
              investigations involve primarily galactic scale systems, and                   
              emphasis is placed on our own Galaxy in most of the projects.  The             
              projects have been motivated by observations of ionized gas in the             
              disk and the halo of our Galaxy, as well as by observations of cool            
              gas in the disk of the Galaxy.  Theoretical developments in the                
              field of nonlinear dynamics have also been an important stimulus               
              for at least one of the studies.                                               
                                                                                             
              There is little question that the problems of understanding large              
              scale disk structure in our Galaxy are entwined with the dynamical             
              properties of its gaseous interstellar medium (ISM).  This is due              
              not only to the well appreciated connection between the ISM and                
              dynamically cold star formation, but also to the belated                       
              realization that the highly responsive gas is an important                     
              structural component in its own right, whether or not it happens               
              to be making stars.  Dr. Balbus' studies generally share a common              
              purpose of developing the connection between local and global                  
              gasdynamical processes commonly occurring in the disk and halo of              
              our Galaxy.
