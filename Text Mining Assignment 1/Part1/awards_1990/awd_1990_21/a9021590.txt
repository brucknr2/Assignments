Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              Virginia Commonwealth University, acting as the lead                           
              institution, has joined with Norfolk State University,                         
              University of Virginia, Virginia Union University, and J.                      
              Sargeant Reynolds Community College, to develop a                              
              comprehensive plan which will significantly increase the                       
              number and quality of minority, particularly black,                            
              scientists and engineers.                                                      
                                                                                             
              Building on extensive existing program aimed at increasing                     
              the number of blacks entering higher education, the Virginia                   
              Alliance considerably enhances these efforts, focuses on                       
              recruiting blacks into science and engineering careers,                        
              ensures continuity by tracking students beyond the short                       
              terms of current projects, and provides a structure that will                  
              greatly improve the flow of students among the respective                      
              institutions.  The Virginia Alliance will marshal all                          
              available resources and provide a comprehensive plan so that                   
              each black student with potential and interest in science                      
              will complete his or her science education and enter the                       
              workforce.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              We will concentrate on undergraduates with the following                       
              programs:                                                                      
              Undergraduate Research Participation; Student Study Groups;                    
              Students Summer Workshops; Curriculum Revision; and Faculty                    
              Workshops.  Industry and government laboratory                                 
              representatives will participates with faculty in a number of                  
              these activities.  Additionally, the program will help                         
              students through the important transition points from high                     
              school to graduate school by extensive mentoring at all                        
              phases.
