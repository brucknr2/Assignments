Abstract    :
              This award is for the acquisition of a real time disc system with              
              color monitor, camera, printer, and recorder/player.  The                      
              instruments are to support research projects in motion adaptive                
              video coding with motion compensation and motion measurement by                
              matching approaches.  The instrument upgrades current black and                
              white equipment to color.                                                      
                                                                                             
              One method of squeezing more use out of limited broadcast channels             
              is to discover new ways of coding color and motion information.                
              These will become particularly important with the advent of high               
              definition television and is critical to some of the proposed HDTV             
              standards.  This equipment award is for the acquisition of a real              
              time color video display system for use in research on motion and              
              color coding algorithms.
