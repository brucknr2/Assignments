Abstract    :
              This award will provide supplemental support to enable Dr. Charles             
              Warner of the Food and Drug Administration to conduct a collabora-             
              tive research for one year with Dr. Kunitoshi Yoshikera, Director              
              of the Division of Food Abilities of the Japanese National                     
              Institute of Hygienic Sciences.  He will conduct research on the               
              safety of butylated amisole (BHA) and butylated tolerence (BHT)                
              when used to extend the useful service life of frying oils.  This              
              will permit an assessment of the risks and benefits associated                 
              with the use of such syntheti oxidants.  This work will continue               
              work begun by Dr. Frank Joe in the laboratory of Dr. Yoshihara.
