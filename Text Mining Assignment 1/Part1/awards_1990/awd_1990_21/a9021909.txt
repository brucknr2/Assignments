Abstract    :
                   The object of this research is the physics of the discharge               
              process in both the visible and ultraviolet portions of the                    
              spectrum.  In addition, electric fields will be measured using a               
              system of "slow and fast" antennas contributed by Professor Marx               
              Brook.
