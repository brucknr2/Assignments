Abstract    :
                   Over the past 15 years, Dr. William Quinn has been an active              
              participant in the genetic dissection of memory.  In well                      
              controlled behavioral experiments, Dr. Quinn and his colleagues                
              have isolated mutant flies with specific deficits in associative               
              learning and proceeded to characterize the molecular defects that              
              underlie them.  One of the advantages of the Drosophila as an                  
              experimental system is that it is "holistic"; the effect of                    
              molecular perturbations on behavior are observable in the intact               
              animal.  The work which will be pursued in the future concerns                 
              ways in which genes will be manipulated in order to evaluate the               
              role of different proteins and enzymes in learning and memory in               
              Drosophila.  The approach presented by Dr. Quinn represents an                 
              original approach to the problem of understanding memory                       
              formation, and a unique wedding of cutting-edge molecular genetic              
              techniques with solid detailed behavioral analysis.
