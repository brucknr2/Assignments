Abstract    :
              The research, in the general area of Analytical and Surface                    
              Chemistry, focuses on studies of collision-induced dissociation                
              of polyatomic ions.  The work promises to lead to a much better                
              understanding of such processes which may play an important                    
              role in the future design of commercial mass spectrometers.                    
                                                                                             
              A systematic study will be carried out of a number of                          
              polyatomic ions, namely enolic C3H6O ions, metal carbonyl ions,                
              aromatic ions and fluorocarbon ions.  The role of electronic                   
              excitation prior to and after collisional activation will be                   
              examined with a view to understanding the mechanism of the                     
              collision-induced dissociation process.  Experiments will be                   
              performed in a unique instrument specially adapted to these                    
              studies.
