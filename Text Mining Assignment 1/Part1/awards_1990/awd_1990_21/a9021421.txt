Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              In large  flexible structures, control is required to                          
              eliminate vibrations induced by actions within and on the                      
              structure.  The structure may comprise new materials which                     
              provide an inherent capability to actuate every strut in a                     
              truss or any discretized field of body forces in a solid.                      
              Furthermore, the structure configuration itself may change                     
              over time.  Adaptive control is an appealing concept for                       
              such problems since it provides system identification and                      
              updating with system changes.  This project applies                            
              adaptive control to an arbitrarily large structure, of the                     
              type previously described, and uses neural (massively                          
              parallel) computing to implement the control.  Earlier                         
              neural network research suggest that a neural network                          
              approach may constitute a powerful architecture for the                        
              adaptive control of large structures.  The research seeks                      
              fundamental analogues to prove or disprove a neural network                    
              capability for the large structures problem.
