                   This Special Minority Award provides a second year of                     
              support for Pablo Saez, a graduate student at Stanford                         
              University.  The award will allow Mr. Saez to finish his course                
              work expeditiously and reach the research participation phase                  
              sooner.  This award is an integral part of the strategy of the                 
              National Science Foundation to strengthen and increase minority                
              participation in the field of physics.
