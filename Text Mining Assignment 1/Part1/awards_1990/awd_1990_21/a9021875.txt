Abstract    :
              This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                
              award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to Rancho             
              Santa Ana Botanical Gardens for the replacement of a seed storage              
              facility and greenhouses and for the repair and renovation of                  
              laboratories which house systematic and evolutionary botanical                 
              research and research training activities.  These buildings were               
              constructed, respectively, in pre-1950, 1960, and 1969 and none of             
              them has been renovated to date.  The ARFMP grant of $400,000 and              
              $400,000 provided by the grantee as cost sharing will be used to               
              modernize these research and research training facilities which                
              will permit current research and research training programs to                 
              expand in scope and duration and to encompass an array of                      
              experimental procedures that it is currently infeasible to use.                
              This project will address the need to improve the current research             
              infrastructure both in terms of health and safety and of the                   
              quantity, quality, and diversity of research that can be conducted             
              by providing space for research and research training which is                 
              adequately heated, cooled, and ventilated and which conforms to                
              current building codes.                                                        
                                                                                             
              This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                     
              providing an improved environment for the conduct of systematic                
              and evolutionary botanical research and for the training of                    
              quality graduate students in a program that plays an important                 
              role in the research training of minority students, that excels in             
              its integration of field, greenhouse, laboratory, and herbarium                
              research techniques, and that fills an important need in its                   
              production of well- and broadly-trained plant systematists.
