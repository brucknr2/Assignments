Abstract    :
                   This award will cover the second US-USSR summer workshop                  
              in cosmology.  It will bring together 10 Soviet and 10                         
              American young scientists to discuss topics in three branches                  
              of cosmology:  quantum cosmology, physical processes in the                    
              early universe, and observational studies of the recent                        
              universe.  The workshop will be held at the Aspen Center for                   
              Physics.                                                                       
                   Cosmology is currently an exciting topic, crossing normal                 
              disciplinary lines of science.  This meeting will foster                       
              collaboration between the two countries' best young                            
              scientists.
