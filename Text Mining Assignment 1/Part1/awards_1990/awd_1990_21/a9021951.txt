Abstract    :
              The purpose of this research is to analyze the role of                         
              immigration, commodity trade and capital markets on the evolution              
              of an international labor market linking Europe and the New World              
              over the century following 1870.  Rather than pursuing the                     
              traditional focus on the migrations themselves, the project will               
              focus instead on wages and employment in sending and receiving                 
              regions, identifying episodes of labor market integration and                  
              disintegration as well as isolating the causes for these changes.              
              Special attention will be given to the role of environmental                   
              factors leading to labor force migration such as the Irish potato              
              famine and the environmental decay experienced by urban centers                
              during the industrial revolution.   The project will also explore              
              the role of migration in distributing the incidence of                         
              unemployment in response to global output shocks, including                    
              identifying country experience with wage flexibility and                       
              stickiness, and how that experience is related to international                
              migrations and the attributes of sectors which dominate sending                
              and receiving regions.  The project will also search for an                    
              endogenous explanation for the timing and location of quotas,                  
              subsidies, and other policy interventions.  This research is                   
              important because it will enhance our understanding of the                     
              dynamics of labor migration and the impact of environmental                    
              change on migration.
