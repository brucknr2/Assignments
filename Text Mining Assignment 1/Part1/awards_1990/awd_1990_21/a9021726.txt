Abstract    :
              This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                
              award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to New                
              Mexico State University for the renovation and repair of the                   
              chemistry building which houses the research and research training             
              activities of the Department of Chemistry.  This building was                  
              constructed in 1957 and expanded by means of the addition of a new             
              wing in 1968.  The ARFMP grant of $200,000 and $200,000 provided by            
              the grantee as cost sharing will be used to modernize these                    
              research and research training facilities.  This project, which                
              includes an upgrade in utilities and the addition and relocation of            
              fume hoods, will address the need to improve the current research              
              infrastructure in terms of both safety and efficiency.                         
                                                                                             
              This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                     
              providing an improved environment for the conduct of research and              
              for the training of undergraduate and graduate students.  It will              
              help support New Mexico State University in its important role of              
              educating minority students and facilitating their entry into and              
              retention in the human resources pipeline.
