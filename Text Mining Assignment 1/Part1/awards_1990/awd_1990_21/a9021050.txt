Abstract    :
                   In spite of the large body of work on invasive, in situ                   
              medical devices, there is very little research to draw from in the             
              area of non-invasive devices. The proposed research plans to                   
              develop a non-invasive instrument to do blood panels based on                  
              optical imaging techniques. The approach to this development will              
              be by trying to characterize blood cells through the skin, using               
              optical imaging techniques with coherent, visible light. One                   
              possibility would be using interferometric techniques using pulsed             
              lasers.
