Abstract    :
              This research in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of                
              the Chemistry Division involves experimental investigations into               
              two major areas of chemical dynamics:  1) extending studies of                 
              intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution (IVR) in real                 
              time to reactive systems in the electronically excited state; and              
              2) developing a new approach for looking at dynamics on ground-                
              state potential energy surfaces in real time.  The time scale of               
              these studies is in the picosecond to femtosecond regime.  The                 
              mode specificity, time scale and nature, role of rotations and                 
              collisions, and influence of symmetry on IVR will be targeted.                 
              The focus of the reactive dynamics will be on state-to-state rates             
              of elementary reactions, the effect of total energy, mode                      
              specificity, and the role of angular momentum on reaction rates.

              Until recently it was not possible to follow molecules in the                  
              process of exchanging energy or reacting to form products.                     
              Chemists deduced the forces and energies involved in collisions by             
              examining the state of the interacting species before and after                
              the collisional event.  Professor Zewail has been a pioneer in                 
              developing time-resolved techniques which allow an unequivocal                 
              picture of collisions as they happen.  Such studies are important              
              because they help answer some fundamental questions in chemistry:              
              how do reactions occur, and how does the released energy of                    
              reaction dissipate?  The proposed work examines some of these                  
              questions.
