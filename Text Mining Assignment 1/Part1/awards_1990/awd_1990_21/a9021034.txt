Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The dynamics and physical structures in the cores of molecular                 
              clouds are important because they are key ingredients for                      
              understanding the clouds and their physical and chemical evolution.            
              Dr. Helene Dickel will investigate the velocity, temperature, and              
              density fields of interstellar clouds by comparing observed                    
              intensity profiles of different transitions of molecular species               
              with theoretical profiles calculated from the transfer of radiation            
              through a model cloud.  Dr. Dickel will be looking for unique                  
              signatures in the profiles which either point to a particular                  
              dynamical situation or by their existence (or absence) can place               
              bounds on a particular range of cloud parameters.
