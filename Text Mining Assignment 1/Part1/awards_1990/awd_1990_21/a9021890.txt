Abstract    :
              This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                
              award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to Fisk               
              University for the renovation and repair of Talley-Brady Hall                  
              which houses that institution's research and research training                 
              activities in chemistry and physics.  This building was                        
              constructed in 1931 and has not been renovated since that time.                
              The ARFMP grant of $800,000 and $1,400,000 provided by the grantee             
              as cost sharing will be used to modernize these research and                   
              research training facilities.  This project will address the need              
              to improve the current research infrastructure by providing                    
              adequate plumbing; heating, ventilation, and air conditioning                  
              (HVAC); and electrical systems in order to rectify the problems of             
              poor water condition, including the pressure and drain system,                 
              poor climate control, and poorly grounded outlets.                             
                                                                                             
              This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                     
              providing an improved environment for the conduct of a wide range              
              of research activities in chemistry and physics and for the                    
              training of quality undergraduate and master's degree students in              
              an institution with a strong commitment to increasing the number               
              of black science majors graduated.
