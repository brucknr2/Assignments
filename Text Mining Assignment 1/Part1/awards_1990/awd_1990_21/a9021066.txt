Abstract    :
              The current ASTM requirements for reinforcing bar geometry were                
              established over 40 years ago and are now incorporated in four ASTM            
              specifications covering reinforcing bars.  The proposed research               
              will apply the latest in analysis and testing techniques to                    
              evaluate currently used and potential new rib geometries, and to               
              develop recommendations aimed at obtaining optimum reinforcing bar             
              development characteristics.  The program will include a basic                 
              study of the interactions at the steel-concrete interface, apply               
              nonlinear finite element analyses to evaluate different rib                    
              geometries, test existing patterns and prototype bars, design and              
              produce reinforcing bars with new patterns, and evaluate the bars              
              in full-size structural members.  Structural considerations will               
              include the effects of the interactions of closely spaced                      
              reinforcement, the behavior of splices as well as straight                     
              development, cyclic loading, fatigue and fracture, and high                    
              strength concrete.  In addition the effects of epoxy coating on                
              bond strength and modifications to epoxy coatings, such as the                 
              addition of grit, will be considered.
