Abstract    :
              The objective of the proposed research is to develop techniques                
              that would allow a building equipped with an energy management                 
              system to be operated in a cost efficient manner.  These techniques            
              would be implemented in the energy management system and                       
              automatically utilize operating data to perform a number of                    
              important functions including on-line optimal control, performance             
              monitoring and fault detection.  Methodologies for optimal control             
              strategies would be developed to allow the plant to operate at                 
              minimum cost.  These methodologies would involve development of                
              simulation models for the plant and the components, with parameter             
              estimation techniques employed that utilize operating data.  Fault             
              detection would allow assessment of changes in plant performance               
              and identification of the sources of the change.  Both analytical              
              and experimental approaches will be employed to test the validity              
              of the methodologies.  The results of the research will be                     
              algorithms that can be directly incorporated in energy management              
              systems.
