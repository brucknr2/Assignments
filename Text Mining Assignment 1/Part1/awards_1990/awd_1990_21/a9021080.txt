Abstract    :
                   This Research Opportunity Award funds a project "Effect of                
              Water Soil Matrices on Heat Transfer Rates in Contaminated Soil                
              Remediation" at Howard University in support of New Jersey                     
              Institute of Technology's Industry/University Cooperative Research             
              Center for Hazardous Substance Management.  This two year project              
              is reporting to the Center's Industry Advisory Board.                          
                   The project is studying the thermal desorption with                       
              afterburner destruction in the incineration of soils to develop a              
              working model for soil decontamination.  The model is expected to              
              predict the conditions for applicability of thermal treatment to               
              site clean up for the National Site Remediation Program.                       
                   The Principal Investigators are competent and have the                    
              facilities to perform the research.                                            
                   The Program Manager recommends Howard University be awarded               
              $99,976 for two (2) years.
