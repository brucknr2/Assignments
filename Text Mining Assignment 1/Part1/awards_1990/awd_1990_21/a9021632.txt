Abstract    :
                   Dr. Edward Green is studying the intricate electrophysiology              
              of a brain structure, the hippocampus,  which is known to be                   
              involved in learning and memory.  His work should provide                      
              important information regarding the nature of the information                  
              processing which takes place in the dentate gyrus, a special                   
              region of the hippocampus, during exploratory behavior.                        
              Furthermore, this work is designed to evaluate functional                      
              alterations in the hippocampus associated with behavioral                      
              exploration.  The proposed studies will utilize                                
              electrophysiological recordings of field potentials and single                 
              unit responses of granule cells in the dentate gyrus of freely                 
              moving rats.  The specific goals of the work include: a) an                    
              evaluation of the interaction between the transient alterations                
              in synaptic transmission related to behavioral state, and                      
              moderately persistent changes in synaptic efficacy that are                    
              associated with exploratory behavior; b) an assessment of the                  
              role of adrenal hormones in naturally occurring, synaptic                      
              efficacy changes in the dentate gyrus that accompany exploratory               
              behavior; c) a determination of whether the locus coeruleus is                 
              necessary for producing environmentally-modulated alterations in               
              granule cell excitability; d) an evaluation of whether naturally-              
              occurring alterations in synaptic efficacy and electrically -                  
              induced long-term potentiation share a common synaptic mechanism;              
              and e) a comparison of granule cell unit activity during specific              
              behaviors in the home environment to unit activity during the                  
              same behaviors following exploration.  Findings from these                     
              studies will provide us with detailed information about how a                  
              specific area of the brain processes information and retains that              
              information for the purpose of memory storage.
