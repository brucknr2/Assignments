Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The role of epigenetic regulation of the calcium dependent cell                
              adhesion molecule, N-cadherin, in cell adhesion will be studied                
              in the chick neural retina.  Biochemical studies will be                       
              performed to describe the post-translational modification of N-                
              cadherin by phosphorylation and sulfation and the relationship of              
              these post-translational modifications to N-cadherin function                  
              will be determined.  More generally, these studies will define                 
              mechanisms involved in cell-cell interactions that are important               
              to the development of neuronal specificity.
