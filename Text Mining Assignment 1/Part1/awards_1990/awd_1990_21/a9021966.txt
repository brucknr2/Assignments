Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Females of many species, including humans, tend to have lower                  
              thresholds for sensory stimuli and can perform motor tasks more                
              rapidly than males.  Moreover, differences in sensorimotor                     
              function normally occur during the estrous cycle or menstrual                  
              cycle and administration of exogenous gonadal steroid hormones                 
              can mimic these natural changes.  Dr. Becker has evidence to                   
              suggest that estrogen enhances sensorimotor responsiveness by                  
              having direct effects on the neurons of the basal ganglia that                 
              use dopamine as the neurotransmitter.  She will examine this                   
              steroid-neurotransmitter relationship by analyzing both                        
              presynaptic and postsynaptic effects of estrogen on the dopamine               
              system.  By comparing the effects of estrogen on dopamine release              
              and receptor activity in both males and females, Dr. Becker will               
              determine whether the known sex differences in sensorimotor                    
              performance is related to biochemical differences.  Her                        
              experiments not only enhance our understanding of the                          
              relationship between hormones and neurotransmitters but also how               
              these processes modulate basal ganglia function.  Since the basal              
              ganglia of the brain is involved in a number of clinical                       
              disorders, including Parkinson's Disease and Huntington's                      
              Disease, these results have important implications for our                     
              understanding and treatment of these debilitating disorders and                
              other related movement disorders.
