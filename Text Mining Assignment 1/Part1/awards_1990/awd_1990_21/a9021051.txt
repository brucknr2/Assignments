Abstract    :
                   The purpose of this research project is to investigate the                
              nonlinear optical properties of d-doped GaAs and to design and                 
              characterize unique space charge structures created with this new              
              doping techniques. One of the main objectives is to merge and                  
              incorporate the concepts of nonlinear optics and atomic layer                  
              doping of semiconductors for the first time by implementing                    
              creative methods of materials characterization with hopes of                   
              developing a better understanding and advancing both of these areas            
              in materials science.
