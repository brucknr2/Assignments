Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Trinity University is establishing a connection to NSFNET via a                
              56,000 bits per second line through the THENET mid-level network.              
              Examples of enhancement of Trinitys research programs include:                
              direct control of observing programs at remote telescopes for                  
              radio astronomy, rapid access to digital data for earthquake                   
              seismology, access to climate modeling programs on the Cray Y-MP               
              at the National Center for Atmospheric Research for solar energy,              
              and exchange of software with the National Institutes of Health                
              for cell imaging research.  This award provides partial support                
              for installation of the connection and the first year of                       
              operation.***//
