Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              While it is known that ovarian and adrenal steroid hormones are                
              involved in the regulation of reproductive behaviors, the                      
              question remains as to the specific role that androgen and                     
              estrogen play.  While once considered a straightforward question,              
              it is now complicated by the finding that testosterone, the major              
              androgen, is metabolized into estrogen in peripheral and neural                
              tissues.  Since strong evidence is accumulating to suggest a                   
              function for androgen in expression of female behavior in both                 
              humans and primates, it becomes imperative to know the identity                
              of the hormone mediating each function.  Dr. Rissman has                       
              developed a model system to examine this important question.  She              
              uses members of a small primitive mammalian species of the order               
              of Insectivora which have a number of striking features similar                
              to humans.  Dr. Rissman has designed a series of experiments to                
              determine whether androgen is acting directly or by its neural                 
              metabolism to estrogen.  Once she has this information, Dr.                    
              Rissman will define the location in the brain where the hormone                
              is acting.  These studies will provide important information                   
              towards understanding the underlying neural mechanisms.                        
              Moreover, this work could be very beneficial in prescribing                    
              hormonal therapy for postmenopausal women and women who have had               
              their ovaries and/or adrenals removed for medical purposes.
