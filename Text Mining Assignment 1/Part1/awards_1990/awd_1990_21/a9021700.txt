Abstract    :
              This award addresses the operation of the Cornell High-Energy                  
              Synchrotron Source (CHESS) through the next three years.  The award            
              also provides for two months of dedicated operation of the CESR                
              storage ring in order to carry out experiments with the hard x-ray             
              undulator, and for a new permanent hydrid wiggler in CHESS WEST.
