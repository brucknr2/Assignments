Abstract    :
                   Spalangia cameroni is a small wasp which lays its eggs in                 
              the pupal stage of house flies.  This research focuses on the                  
              ability of female S. cameroni to manipulate the offspring sex                  
              ratios (the proportion of sons) they produce in response to the                
              size of the host (fly) in which the offspring is laid.  Females                
              lay a greater proportion of sons on small hosts than on large                  
              hosts.  An effect of host size on wasp offspring sex ratios has                
              now been found in more than forty species of parasitoid wasps in               
              thirteen different families.  This research will address two                   
              areas for which there is currently very little information:  how               
              manipulation of sex ratio in response to host size affects a                   
              mother's success at reproducing and how mothers assess host size.              
                   Species of Spalangia have been released in poultry houses                 
              and stables to control pest flies, especially house flies.  Use                
              of such "biological controls" is becoming increasingly important               
              as the flies become resistant to more and more insecticides.                   
              Research on sex ratios is important in terms of being able                     
              successfully to rear large numbers of wasps for release.
