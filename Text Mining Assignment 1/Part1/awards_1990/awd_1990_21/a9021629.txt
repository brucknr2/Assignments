Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Nerve cells can only utilize glucose as an energy source through               
              the process of glucose degradation known as glycolysis.  The                   
              reason for this metabolic restriction is unknown.  In addition to              
              supplying energy to nerve cells, glucose is important for normal               
              synaptic transmission in brain by being a substrate for                        
              neurotransmitter synthesis.  This research project will examine                
              how the process of glycolysis regulates cerebral synaptic                      
              transmission.  Dr. Lipton will study whether glycolysis inhibits               
              the formation of ammonia, a compound present in all cells using                
              amino acid derivatives as an energy source.  Traces of ammonia                 
              have been found to inhibit synaptic transmission.                              
              Electrophysiological studies, using hippocampal slices, will be                
              conducted to test whether glucose metabolism is coupled to                     
              transmission by supplying energy in the form of ATP and whether                
              glycolysis prevents ammonia build up.  Results of this study will              
              elucidate an important aspect of brain metabolism, and the                     
              etiology of several nervous system dysfunctions.
