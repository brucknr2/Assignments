Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Clathrates are ice-like, crystalline solids composed of water and              
              low molecular weight gas molecules.  Because of the unique                     
              pressure and temperature fields in which they are stable,                      
              clathrates tend to be abundant in continental slope and rise                   
              sediments in the deep sea.  The resulting precipitation of solid               
              clathrates within marine sediments is detectable from the                      
              occurrence of bottom-parallel reflectors which are visible in                  
              seismic reflection records, are generally parallel to the ocean                
              bottom, and cut across other sediment reflections.  The bottom                 
              parallel reflector apparently represents the base of the                       
              clathrate stability field.  Below this reflector the clathrate                 
              decomposes into fresh water and dissolved gas.                                 
                                                                                             
              Few pristine samples of clathrates from the deep-sea have ever                 
              been fully analyzed, since the clathrates tends to decompose                   
              rapidly when brought to the sea surface. Recently the Ocean                    
              Drilling Program has developed a pressure core barrel which is                 
              capable of retrieving a one meter long sample of marine sediment               
              and returning the material to the drillship under in situ                      
              pressure.  During a recent engineering test of this system, an                 
              undisturbed sample was recovered from the Nankai Trench.  the                  
              present award will support preliminary development of the                      
              necessary analytical techniques to examine this unexpected sample              
              important in fully documenting chemical reactions and conditions               
              and in evaluating the release of clathrates gasses to the                      
              atmosphere during sea-level changes.
