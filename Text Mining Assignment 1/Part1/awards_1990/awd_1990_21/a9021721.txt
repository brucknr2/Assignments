Abstract    :
              This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                
              award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to                    
              Barnard College for the renovation and repair of Altschul Hall                 
              which houses that institution's biology research and research                  
              training activities.  This building was constructed in 1969 and                
              has not been renovated since that time.  The ARFMP grant of                    
              $125,000 and $125,000 provided by the grantee as cost sharing will             
              be used to modernize these research and research training                      
              facilities.  This project will address the need to improve the                 
              current research infrastructure by enhancing the adequacy of the               
              space for accommodating disparate activities, including increasing             
              its capacity for the maintenance of various cultures of micro-                 
              organisms and the housing of experiments, and by an overall                    
              upgrading of the space involving modification of its structure and             
              the electrical, the plumbing, and the heating, ventilation, and air            
              conditioning (HVAC) systems.  The increased availability of                    
              laboratory space to students that accrues from this renovation can             
              be expected to raise the quality of the student research training              
              experience and to permit more students to study and major in                   
              biology.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                     
              providing an improved environment for the conduct of research and              
              the training of quality undergraduate students.  It will help                  
              Barnard College maintain and expand its long standing                          
              leadership as an undergraduate source of women scientists.
