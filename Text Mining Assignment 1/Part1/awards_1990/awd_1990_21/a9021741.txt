Abstract    :
              This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                
              award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to Reed               
              College for the replacement of the Chemistry Building which houses             
              the research and research training activities of the Chemistry                 
              Department.  This building was constructed during World War II and             
              has not been renovated since that time.  Its replacement is fully              
              justified and cost-effective.  The ARFMP grant of $816,000 and                 
              $1,149,525 provided by the grantee as cost sharing will be used to             
              modernize these research and research training facilities.  This               
              project will address the need to improve the current research                  
              infrastructure by providing support for that portion of the                    
              construction of an upgraded space which represents replacement of              
              the old facility, complete with the installation of adequate                   
              electrical and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC)               
              systems and fume hoods.                                                        
                                                                                             
              This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                     
              providing an improved environment for the conduct of research and              
              for the training of quality undergraduate students in a liberal                
              arts college well known for the high percentage of its graduates               
              who go on to receive doctoral degrees in the sciences.
