Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                             
                  This project continues the documentation of Chiwere, a                    
              Siouan language in the late stages of obsolescence, a language                 
              that has fewer than 15 fluent speakers.  Probably as a result of               
              the disuse of Chiwere as an every-day form of communication for                
              more than a generation, all present-day speakers of Chiwere, even              
              fluent ones, exhibit some gaps in their knowledge of the                       
              language.  These inadequacies appear to be patterned.  This                    
              project addresses the problem of integration of divergent and                  
              partial knowledge toward recovering a complete grammatical                     
              system.                                                                        
                   Accommodation theory, a theory most usually applied to gain               
              understanding of dialect variation and shift in synchronic                     
              settings, appears to offer a guide to integrating these various                
              less-than-perfect competencies into something resembling a                     
              relatively complete picture of Chiwere as it was in its full                   
              vibrancy of life.  The specific goals for this project are (1) to              
              develop this method for recovery of the complete linguistic                    
              system from several incomplete models, thus enhancing the                      
              description of Chiwere; (2) to devise an explanatory model of                  
              language change in Chiwere that may be more generally applicable               
              for the whole of the Great Plains languages; (3) to reconstruct                
              the paths of language death, i.e., to make a case histroy of                   
              language death in Chiwere; (4) to test hypothese suggested by                  
              accommodation theory about the pattern of decline in Chiwere and               
              its relevance for indicating important features of the language.
