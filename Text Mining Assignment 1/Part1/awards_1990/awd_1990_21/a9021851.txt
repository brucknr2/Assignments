Abstract    :
              This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                
              award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to the                
              University of North Carolina at Greensboro for the renovation and              
              repair of Eberhart Building which houses animal care facilities                
              and the biological and behavioral sciences research and research               
              training activities utilizing these facilities.  This building was             
              constructed in 1971 and expanded by means of an addition in 1977.              
              The ARFMP grant of $285,000 and $286,200 provided by the grantee as            
              cost sharing will be used to modernize these research and research             
              training facilities thus accommodating a carefully planned increase            
              in the research and research training activities taking place in               
              Eberhart and helping to achieve the important goal of                          
              centralization of such facilities among the members of the                     
              Consolidated University of North Carolina.  This project,                      
              addressing the need to improve the research infrastructure by                  
              providing better sanitation and security, will include upgrading of            
              heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC), and modification             
              of the floor plan to add a rack washer, fume hoods, and new animal             
              housing rooms.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                     
              providing an improved environment for the conduct of research and              
              for the training of graduate and undergraduate students.  Students             
              trained in these laboratories, where high standards of animal care             
              are maintained, will bring to their research and clinical careers              
              an appreciation for procedures which meet national standards of                
              practice and accreditation.
