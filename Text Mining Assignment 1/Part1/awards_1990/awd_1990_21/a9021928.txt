Abstract    :
              Modeling nonpremxed turbulent combustion is a formidable task                  
              due to coupling between the thermochemical equations and the                   
              three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations.  There is a strong                  
              incentive to decouple the chemistry problem from the                           
              turbulence.  Laminar flamelet modeling is a salient approach                   
              to decoupling, and is often used in current combustion                         
              modeling.  The principal objective of the proposed research is                 
              the investigation of the validity of laminar flamelet modeling                 
              of turbulent diffusion flames  The approach to this scientific                 
              objective is to perform direct numerical simulation of                         
              turbulent diffusion flame cases.  The research via simulations                 
              will be combined with theoretical investigations in one of the                 
              cases when the chemistry is kept simple.  In order to                          
              investigate a realistic model of hydrogen flames the partial                   
              equilibrium chemistry model will be implemented in conjunction                 
              with the 3D Navier-Stokes equations.  The analytic                             
              investigations will be performed in interaction with ongoing                   
              laboratory work elsewhere.                                                     
                                                                                             
              Improved understanding of the validity of laminar flamelet                     
              modeling will significantly contribute to turbulent flame                      
              modeling efforts, with eventual applications to critical                       
              issues in combustion systems such as ignition and pollutant                    
              formation.
