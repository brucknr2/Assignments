Abstract    :
              This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                
              award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to Brown              
              University for the renovation and repair of the Barus and Holley               
              Building which houses the major portion of the materials science               
              research and research training activities of the Division of                   
              Engineering and the Department of Physics.  This building was                  
              constructed in 1965 and has not previously been renovated.  The                
              ARFMP grant of $660,000 and $770,000 provided by the grantee as                
              cost sharing will be used to modernize these research and research             
              training facilities.  This project will address the need to improve            
              the current research infrastructure by correcting system and design            
              problems that affect safety, reliability, capacity, energy,                    
              maintenance, and ecology and which primarily involve the remodeling            
              of the heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) and chilled            
              water service.  Accruing from this renovation will be the                      
              unrestricted use of fume hoods, the enhancement of the computing               
              capacity, and improvement in flexibility related to the use of                 
              electrical equipment.                                                          
                                                                                             
              This award contributes to the infrastructure of science and                    
              engineering by providing an improved environment for the conduct               
              of research and for the training of quality undergraduate and                  
              graduate students.  Students trained in these laboratories are                 
              products of a large internationally-recognized center of                       
              excellence which has had and continues to have a major impact on               
              our national research effort, especially in the areas of solid                 
              state electronics and the mechanics of materials.
