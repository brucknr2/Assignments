Abstract    :
              This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                
              award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to the                
              University of Wyoming for replacement of the Botany Greenhouse                 
              Facility which houses botany research and research training                    
              activities.  This building was constructed in 1940 and last                    
              renovated in 1972.  The ARFMP grant of $575,000 and $745,000                   
              provided by the grantee as cost sharing will be used to modernize              
              these research and research training facilities.  This project                 
              will address the need to improve the current research                          
              infrastructure by replacing a facility for which renovation is not             
              cost effective.  The replacement of the greenhouse and headhouse               
              will make possible optimal plant research and higher level                     
              controlled experiments than are currently feasible, and it will                
              contribute to the Botany Department's goal of coordinating faculty             
              to address fundamental questions about photosynthesis and plant                
              adaptation.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                     
              providing an improved environment for the conduct of research and              
              for the training of undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral                  
              students.  The Departments of Biology and Botany at the University             
              of Wyoming are in the process of formulating aggressive student                
              recruitment protocols that are attracting student majors from the              
              region.
