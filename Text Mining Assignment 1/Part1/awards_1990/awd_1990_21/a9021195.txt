Abstract    :
              Professor Marcus is supported by a grant from the Theoretical                  
              and Computational Chemistry Program to perform theoretical                     
              studies of chemical kinetics.  This research will provide a                    
              more detailed understanding of various dynamical effects which                 
              occur in the broad areas of electron and proton transfer                       
              reactions, intramolecular dynamics, and unimolecular processes.                
                                                                                             
              Professor Marcus intends to study a variety of theoretical                     
              problems in chemical kinetics and related areas.  These include                
              unimolecular reactions, electron and proton transfer reactions,                
              and intramolecular dynamics.  The unimolecular reactions will                  
              involve the study of vibrational-rotational quantum                            
              state-to-state reactivities for various molecules.  The                        
              electron transfers studied will include electron transfers at                  
              semiconductor-liquid interfaces and electron transfers in                      
              various protein systems.  In the area of intramolecular                        
              dynamics, the high-resolution and time-resolved vibronic                       
              spectra in the quantum beats and in the "dissipative" regimes                  
              will be investigated.  The proton transfer studies at low and                  
              high energies will be related to the studies of intramolecular                 
              dynamics in the two regimes on one hand, and to concepts used                  
              in electron transfer on the other.
