Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A remarkable property of many visual systems is the capacity to                
              abstract the direction, velocity and position of a moving target.              
              Detection occurs over a wide range of velocities, stimulus                     
              configurations and lighting conditions.  Although the neuronal                 
              apparatus of visual motion detection has been studied intensively              
              for over 30 years, the mechanism is still unknown.  A major                    
              impediment to our current understanding is an absence of both                  
              measurements and realistic theoretical constructs regarding the                
              synaptic processes by which a network of visual interneurons can               
              compute the direction and velocity of a moving target.  In this                
              respect, arthropods, particularly large crustaceans like                       
              crayfish, provide a favorable model for a combined experimental                
              and theoretical approach to the problem.  Our studies indicate                 
              that a mechanism can be resolved into interactions among four                  
              classes of identified neurons.
