Abstract    :
              This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                
              award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to Iowa               
              State University for the renovation and repair of the                          
              Microelectronics Research Center which houses that institution's               
              microelectronics and photonics research and research training                  
              activities.  This building was constructed in 1962 and currently               
              its heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system is in the                
              process of being updated.  The ARFMP grant of $275,000 and                     
              $275,000 provided by the grantee as cost sharing will be used to               
              modernize these research and research training facilities.  This               
              project will address the need to improve the current research                  
              infrastructure both in terms of accessibility and of safety.  This             
              renovation will permit the expansion of the spectrum of research               
              and research training activities into areas which heretofore have              
              been inaccessible.                                                             
                                                                                             
              This award contributes to the infrastructure of science and                    
              engineering by providing an improved environment for the conduct               
              of research and for the training of quality undergraduate and                  
              graduate students.  The renovation will permit not only the                    
              overall expansion of research and research training activities,                
              but also relatively greater expansion of those activities for                  
              undergraduates and women students at all levels.
