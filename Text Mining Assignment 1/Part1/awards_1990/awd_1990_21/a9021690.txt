Abstract    :
              This award provides partial support of a three day                             
              conference dealing with "The Role of the Southern Ocean and                    
              Antarctica in Global Change: an Ocean Drilling Perspective"                    
              to be held at the University of California at Santa Barbara.                   
              The primary objective will be to discuss and synthesize the                    
              data from the recent Antarctic and Subantarctic Ocean                          
              Drilling Program (ODP) Legs 113, 114, 119, 120 and 121.  The                   
              emphasis will be to develop a better understanding of the                      
              environmental and biotic evolution of the Antarctic region                     
              during the Late Cretaceous through the Cenozoic and the                        
              effect this had on global environmental evolution.  The                        
              proposed conference will provide an impetus for the                            
              construction of a set of broad syntheses of Late Cretaceous-                   
              Cenozoic environmental evolution of the Antarctic region                       
              based on results largely gained during these expeditions.                      
              The synthesis papers presented at the meeting will be                          
              published (after peer review) in a synthesis volume either                     
              through in Ocean Drilling Program or in the American                           
              Geophysical Union's Antarctic Research Series.
