Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will study partial differential                
              equations with random noise terms.  Such equations often arise when            
              physical systems are influenced by noise.  This work will consider             
              qualitative properties of solutions in the nonlinear case.  There              
              are several goals of this project.  The first would involve the                
              carrying over of the coupling technique from the field of infinite             
              particle systems to stochastic partial differential equations.                 
              Another goal is the development of Ito's formula for the heat                  
              equations with a noise term.  Also, propagation of singularities               
              would be studied for random hyperbolic equations.
