Abstract    :
              This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                
              award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to                    
              Carnegie Mellon University for the renovation and repair of the                
              Mellon Institute Building which houses the research and research               
              training activities of the Chemistry Department.  This building                
              was constructed in 1933 and last renovated in 1937.  The ARFMP                 
              grant of $1,600,000 and $1,600,000 provided by the grantee as cost             
              sharing will be used to modernize these research and research                  
              training facilities.  This project will address the need to improve            
              the current research infrastructure by upgrading all building                  
              services and providing adequate fume hoods so that the facilities              
              will meet current health and safety standards and  will be                     
              compatible with the use of modern research equipment and                       
              procedures.  The renovated facilities will increase the quantity               
              and quality of research conducted in a wide range of important                 
              areas, including polymer and materials sciences, biological                    
              chemistry, and nuclear and theoretical chemistry.                              
                                                                                             
              This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                     
              providing an improved environment for the conduct of research and              
              for the training of quality undergraduate and graduate students.               
              The Chemistry Department at Carnegie Mellon University explicitly              
              recognizes that faculty research, graduate student research and                
              education, and undergraduate research training and education form              
              a cohesive whole in a strong department and, conducted                         
              accordingly, can make a particularly significant contribution to               
              the future of our nation's science.
