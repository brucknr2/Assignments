Abstract    :
              This award provides travel funds for students                                  
              and young faculty to travel to an important                                    
              meeting in the field of microelectromechanical                                 
              engineering.  The meeting is the 1991 Micro                                    
              Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) Workshop,                                    
              which will be held in Nara, Japan, in January of                               
              1991.  These travel funds will make it possible                                
              for many graduate students to prepare and                                      
              present papers at this conference, and it will                                 
              enable young faculty beginning their research                                  
              careers to attend an important meeting.                                        
              Participation by students and young faculty at                                 
              previous meetings has been highly beneficial                                   
              both to the people involved and the field.  This                               
              field is very young, and not many researchers                                  
              are well established with research support.                                    
              Thus, these travel grants play a key role in the                               
              development of the field.
