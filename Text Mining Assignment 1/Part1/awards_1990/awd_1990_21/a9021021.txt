Abstract    :
              The objectives of this project are the following:                               
                                                                                             
                  (1)  To investigate transient phenomena which lead to                      
                  incomplete combustion of hazardous wastes.                                 
                                                                                             
                  (2)  To assess the relationship between incinerator size                   
                  (cost) and reliability, and to identify the chemical and                   
                  fluid mechanical phenomena which may limit the ultimate                    
                  degree of waste destruction in small systems.                              
                                                                                             
                  (3)  To evaluate the use of high volumetric heat release                   
                  rate aerospace technology in the development of small                      
                  incinerators, including how combustion acoustics might be                  
                  used to improve and/or monitor incinerator performance.                    
                                                                                            
              The objectives above are to be addressed by means of an                        
              integrated program of experiments and numerical simulations.                   
              The experiments are designed to follow the instantaneous                       
              velocity, temperature and hydroxyl radical concentration                       
              fields in the combusting fluid, from which the three T's of                    
              incineration (residence time, temperature, and turbulence                      
              intensity or mixing) can be calculated.  Experimental results                  
              are to be used in the development of a 2-D transient                           
              combustion model based on the numerical solution of the                        
              conservative form of the conservation equations.  Realistic                    
              chemistry and transport, capable of accurately representing                    
              the interaction of the flame with large scale vortical                         
              structures found in the combustor, are to be used.  The                        
              results are expected to contribute to the development of                       
              small, reliable incinerators which can be used effectively on                  
              the site of small waste generators.
