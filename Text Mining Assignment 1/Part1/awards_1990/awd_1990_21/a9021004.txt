Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project supports the dissertation research of a cultural                  
              anthropologist from the University of California-Davis.  The                   
              student will study the night markets in Taiwan, a local                        
              institution of street markets providing inexpensive prepared                   
              foods and consumer items to urban residents.  The project will                 
              study the history of the markets and the role of government                    
              regulations on their behavior, as well as the meaning of the                   
              markets in the lives of urban residents.  It is a study in the                 
              "informal economy" of a dynamic and productive society.  Methods               
              include surveys of the markets, intensive interviews with                      
              marketers on their life histories, examination of historical                   
              documents, and survey interviews with marketers and customers.                 
                                                                                             
              This project is important because the informal sector of                       
              developing economies is not well understood, and this case study               
              of a dynamic informal market institution in a growing economy                  
              will help build theory on how to achieve and sustain economic                  
              development while providing a high level of consumer service to                
              urban residents.
