Abstract    :
              A Lambda Physik LPX 105i CC excimer gas laser is to be                         
              purchased to improve the ability to accurately measure the                     
              high temperature reaction kinetics of chlorinated hydrocarbon                  
              oxidation and pyrolysis.  The laser will be initially                          
              incorporated into an existing laser photolysis/laser-induced                   
              fluorescence elementary kinetics measurement apparatus.  In                    
              addition to providing a clean source of hydroxyl radicals,                     
              this pump laser will be used to vary photolysis energy                         
              densities over wide ranges, allowing a more thorough                           
              evaluation of secondary reactions.                                             
                                                                                             
              The acquisition of high temperature rate data and mechanistic                  
              information will strongly enhance the currently sparse data                    
              base for chemical kinetic modelling of combustion processes                    
              involving chlorinated hydrocarbons.  This information is                       
              required in order to understand, predict, and control the                      
              formation of toxic emissions from the thermal treatment of                     
              wastes and other industrial processes.
