Abstract    :
                   The purpose of this work is to organize and conduct a                     
              conference on the preferred use of rainfall observations to the                
              mutual benefit of selected problems in meteorology and hydrology.              
              Participants will include students, meteorologists, and                        
              hydrologists.  This forum is the third one of a series initiated               
              in 1984.
