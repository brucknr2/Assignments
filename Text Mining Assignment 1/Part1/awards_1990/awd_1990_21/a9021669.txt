Abstract    :
              This small Grant for Exploratory Research is made in order to                  
              develop a novel experiment for detecting delamination cracks in a              
              composite material.  The techniques uses (relatively) large                    
              amplitudes of vibration in the kilohertz frequency range.  The                 
              damping that occurs in this situation is useful in evaluating                  
              subcritical crack growth.
