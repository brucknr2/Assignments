Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              The project is to arrive at a partial reconstruction and a sub-                
              classification of the Nilo-Saharan Phylum of African languages by              
              examining a lexicon of over 600 items divided into about 65 sets               
              on semantic bases.  An already completed classification based on               
              grammatical isomorphs serves as a basis for starting work.  The                
              methods are the standard comparative-historical ones of looking                
              for regular phonological correspondences and thereby establishing              
              cognate sets.  A sub-project to be done near the end is to run                 
              Multi-Dimensional Scaling programs on the cognate sets to see                  
              what goodness of fit may tell us about the usefulness of this                  
              quantitative method and also for possible alternative                          
              subgroupings.  Results of the entire project will be published in              
              the form of a monograph on the Nilo-Saharan Phylum containing (1)              
              a long introduction to the phylum, its languages and its                       
              speakers, (2) the methods used, (3) tables and charts of the                   
              results, and (4) a table of all significant cognate sets.
