Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Nerve cells undergo dynamic changes during development as well as              
              after reaching maturity.  During development the establishment of              
              specific interconnected neural networks is accomplished, in part,              
              by the removal of extraneous or inappropriate connections                      
              ("synapses").  Similar structural changes in synapses                          
              ("plasticity") can also occur in the mature nervous system                     
              following appropriate environmental stimuli including those                    
              associated with learning and memory.  The research technique                   
              involves the use of a simple culture system of nerve cells                     
              isolated from the marine invertebrate, Aplysia.  Using this model              
              system one can examine whether common mechanisms are responsible               
              for synapse elimination during development and synapse plasticity              
              under conditions which simulate learning and memory in the adult.              
              One important advantage of this model system is that changes in                
              the same set of connections can be compared during development                 
              and in the mature nervous system.  An understanding of these                   
              mechanisms may provide insight into process of development of the              
              nervous system and abnormalities which may occur in adults.
