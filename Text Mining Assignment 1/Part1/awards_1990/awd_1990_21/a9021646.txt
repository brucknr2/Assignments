Abstract    :
                   This project partially supports the Tenth Annual                          
              Southeastern-Atlantic Conference on Differential Equations to be               
              held at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University.               
              The subject matter of the conference encompasses diverse areas in              
              differential equations: ordinary differential equations, partial               
              differential equations, integral and functional differential                   
              equations, applications of differential equations, and related                 
              areas such as numerical analysis and mathematical physics.                     
                   Differential equations have wide applications in all areas                
              of science.  This meeting provides a forum for the exchange of                 
              the latest ideas and information.  Also, the conference provides               
              special support for graduate students and young investigators to               
              present their own work and to meet and discuss their research                  
              with senior researchers.
