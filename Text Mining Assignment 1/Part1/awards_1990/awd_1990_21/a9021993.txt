Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project supports the dissertation research of an                          
              anthropology student studying gender relations in Sweden.                      
              Although Swedish society has outstanding laws on the books                     
              dealing with gender egalitarianism in the workplace, Swedish                   
              society remains strikingly segregated by gender in fact.  The                  
              student will interview female students, professionals at the                   
              beginnings of their careers, and mature professionals about life-              
              history experiences that influenced them to choose their                       
              professions.  The student will also interview parents, friends,                
              spouses, teachers, and other relevant individuals to try to                    
              understand the reasons why women choose their occupations.                     
                                                                                             
              This research is important because government policies often                   
              mandate egalitarian social outcomes that are not achieved in                   
              practice.  Understanding the non-governmental causes of gender                 
              segregation in a society that has the most advanced laws known in              
              the industrialized world can help planners devise programs to                  
              attain the goal of equal opportunity.
