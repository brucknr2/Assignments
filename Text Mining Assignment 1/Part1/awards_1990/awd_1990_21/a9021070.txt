Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This action is to assist in the organization                                   
              of a workshop on "Seismic Microzonation and                                    
              Instrumentation of Geotechnical Structures in                                  
              Chile".  This meeting is to be held at the                                     
              University of Chile in Santiago, with a                                        
              tentative date of January 6-10, 1992.                                          
              Specifically, this action is to provide                                        
              travel support for Professor Chaim Poran of                                    
              the University of North Carolina at Charlotte                                  
              to meet with Prof. Eugenio Retamal in                                          
              Santiago, Chile, to begin planning for this                                    
              workshop.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              This region of Chile is seismically very                                       
              active, and historically and in recent times                                   
              (1985) it has been subjected to large                                          
              damaging earthquakes.  The motivation for                                      
              this meeting is to forge and maintain                                          
              contacts between the U.S. and Chile.                                           
              Following the 1985 earthquake, collaborative                                   
              research projects were initiated to assist                                     
              geotechnical engineers in Chile and the                                        
              United States of learn from that event.  This                                  
              workshop will continue and enhance that                                        
              collaboration; it will assist with the                                         
              development of preparedness plans for the                                      
              next major earthquake in Chile; and it will                                    
              enable researchers in the United States to be                                  
              in a position to learn from that event.
