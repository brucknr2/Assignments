Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The National Academy of Sciences, through its Ocean Studies                    
              Board (OSB), will provide guidance to the National Science                     
              Foundation/Division of Ocean Sciences and other Federal                        
              agencies on major ocean science and policy issues.  This                       
              request is for continued Core Support for the OSB, and a small                 
              amount of support to start a project on "Oceanography for the                  
              1990's".The OSB plans to consider scientific issues related to                 
              continental margins, coastal oceanography, the carbon dioxide                  
              cycle, fisheries  oceanography, marine biotechnology and                       
              "Oceanography in the 1990's"-- over the next few years, with                   
              some of these efforts scheduled to begin in the present fiscal                 
              year.  The OSB will also support U.S. ocean scientists to                      
              provide leadership in these areas internationally, through                     
              support of and participation in the Scientific Committee of                    
              Oceanic Research (SCOR) of the International Council of                        
              Scientific Unions (ICSU).  The OSB will, thus, continue to                     
              contribute to maintaining the health of ocean sciences in the                  
              United States.
