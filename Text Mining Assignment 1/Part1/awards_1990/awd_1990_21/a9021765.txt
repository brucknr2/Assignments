Abstract    :
              This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                
              award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to Winona             
              State University for the repair and renovation of the second floor             
              of Pasteur Hall which houses the Biology Department. This building             
              was constructed in 1961 and has not been renovated since that time.            
              The ARFMP grant of $74,484 and $74,484 provided by the grantee as              
              cost sharing will be used to modernize these research and research             
              training facilities and thus foster the establishment of a research            
              presence in the Biology Department.  This project will address the             
              need to improve the current research infrastructure primarily by               
              means of structural modifications and of upgrading the plumbing and            
              heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems.  The                
              increased quantitiy and visibility of scientific experiments that              
              accrue from this renovation can be expected to expose more students            
              to scientific research and to have an impact on their perception of            
              what research is and how it relates to them.                                   
                                                                                             
              This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                     
              providing an improved environment for the conduct of research in               
              cell and molecular biology and in environmental biology and for                
              the training of quality undergraduate students in a department                 
              with a particular commitment to stimulating nontraditional                     
              students to choose a scientific career.
