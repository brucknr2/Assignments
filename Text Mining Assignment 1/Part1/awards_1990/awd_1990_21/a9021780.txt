Abstract    :
              This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                
              award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to                    
              Canisius College for the repair and renovation of the Health                   
              Science Building which houses the research and research training               
              activities of the Biology Department.  This building was                       
              constructed in 1924 and last renovated in 1969.  The ARFMP grant               
              of $664,513 and $664,513 provided by the grantee as cost sharing               
              will be used to modernize these research and research training                 
              facilities.  This project will address the need to improve the                 
              current research infrastructure by upgrading all existing                      
              laboratories with basic bench services, emergency power, and fume              
              hoods; by modifying the animal unit to insure compliance with                  
              appropriate state and federal regulations; and by renovating the               
              heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system.                      
                                                                                             
              This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                     
              providing an improved environment for the conduct of biological                
              research and for the training of quality undergraduate students.               
              The renovation is expected to enhance the continuing trend of the              
              last decade at Canisius College of increasing undergraduate                    
              participation in research as part of their educational process.                
              The emphasis on time spent doing research at Canisius which has                
              had a major impact in directing students' interests toward careers             
              in science.
