Abstract    :
                   A joint program of theoretical and experimental studies of                
              cross sections for the scattering of low-energy electrons by                   
              molecules is carried out.  Such cross sections play an important               
              role in our understanding and modeling of both fundamentally and               
              technologically significant processes.  Specific objectives:  (1)              
              cross sections for excitation of electronic transitions in carbon              
              monoxide, oxygen, nitric oxide, and nitrogen; (2) theoretical                  
              studies of electron impact excitation of carbon dioxide and                    
              water; (3) theoretical studies of vibrational excitation of water              
              and carbon dioxide; and (4) cross sections for elastic scattering              
              of electrons.
