Abstract    :
              This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                
              award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to                    
              Morehouse College for the repair and renovation of Hope Hall                   
              which houses that institution's biological sciences research and               
              research training activities.  This building was constructed in                
              1929 and last renovated in 1985.  The ARFMP grant of $950,000                  
              and $950,000 provided by the grantee as cost sharing will be                   
              used to modernize these research and research training                         
              facilities.  This project will address the need to improve the                 
              current research infrastructure in terms of health and safety as               
              well as of quantity and quality of research that can be conducted              
              by repairing structural deficiencies and the heating,                          
              ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) and all other building                
              systems.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                     
              providing an improved environment for the conduct of research and              
              for the training of undergraduate students at Morehouse College                
              which is outstanding among Black liberal arts colleges in the                  
              degree of emphasis it places on the preparation of its graduates               
              for research careers.  The project is of special benefit to the                
              broadening of the nation's science base because it facilitates                 
              the provision of quality research and research training                        
              opportunities for minorities.
