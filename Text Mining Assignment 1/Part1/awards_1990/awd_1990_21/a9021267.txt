Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This award is to provide travel support for young scientists              
              to attend the International Conference on Calcitonin Gene-Related              
              Peptide.  Calcitonin gene-related peptide is 37-amino acid                     
              biologically active hormone discovered in 1983 by molecular                    
              techniques.  This neuropeptide has profound effects on the                     
              neural, cardiovascular and gastrointestinal systems and may act                
              as a neuromodulator and/or tropic factor.  The format of this                  
              meeting reflects the interdisciplinary nature of the research.                 
              Topics include the characterization and distribution of the                    
              receptors in the nervous system, the molecular and biochemical                 
              processing of the peptide, its biological actions and a session                
              to address new perspectives.  Indeed, this meeting brings                      
              together, for the first time, leading experts and young                        
              scientists from around the world that use wide variety of                      
              approaches to share information about calcitonin gene-related                  
              peptide.  This cross-pollination of the disciplines will                       
              accelerate process in understanding the role of calcitonin gene-               
              related peptide in intercellular signalling and intracellular                  
              processing in the brain which could have implications for                      
              clinical applications.
