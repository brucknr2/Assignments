Abstract    :
              This research will address the effects of the                                  
              concentrations of carbohydrate (C) and nitrogenous (N)                         
              nutrients, and the C/N ratio, on products obtained from                        
              various microorganisms.  Computerized analysis will be                         
              used to move quickly through a large experimental design.                      
                                                                                             
              The Principal Investigators (PIs) will focus on                                
              growth-associated and non-growth-associated effects, and                       
              on nitrogen starvation.
