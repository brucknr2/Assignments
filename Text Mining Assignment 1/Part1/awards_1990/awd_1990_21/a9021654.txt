Abstract    :
              A proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance study of an interesting class              
              of newly synthesized liquid crystalline materials will be carried              
              out to determine the manner in which molecular structure and                   
              dynamics correlate with liquid crystal phase properties.  Also, NMR            
              will be used to explore issues that include homo- and heteronuclear            
              decoupling in solids; broadband and narrowband coherence transfer              
              in liquids; and order selective and nonselective preparation of                
              multiple quantum coherence in solids, liquids, and liquid crystals.
