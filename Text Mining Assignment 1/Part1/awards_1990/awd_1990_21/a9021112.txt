Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project supports the dissertation research of a student in                
              cultural anthropology.  The project is to examine the social                   
              conditions under which evangelical Protestantism and                           
              "progressive" Catholicism have flourished to challenge the long-               
              dominant folk Catholicism in a proletarianizing peasant village                
              in Mexico.  The project will assemble longitudinal data on socio-              
              economic class, organizational resources, doctrines, political                 
              practices and beliefs of members of the three religious groups.                
              Methods include survey, genealogical interviewing, detailed life               
              histories, interviews with government and religious leaders,                   
              archival research and participant observation.  The main question              
              to be dealt with is the relation of religious affiliation to                   
              changes in socio-economic class position.                                      
                                                                                             
              This research is important because religious change is a striking              
              fact of life in Latin America, and increased understanding of the              
              conditions and consequences of this change will help us deal with              
              the changing sectors of these societies.
