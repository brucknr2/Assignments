Abstract    :
                   This Research Opportunity Award funds a project, "Crack                   
              Propagation Based Life Prediction of Mechanical Components in an               
              Analysis Environment" at Prairie View A & M University in support              
              of the University of Iowa's Industry/University Cooperative                    
              Research Center for Simulation and Design Optimization of                      
              Mechanical Systems.  This two year project is reporting to the                 
              Center's Industry Advisory Board.                                              
                   The project is developing an integrated crack propagation life            
              prediction capability system dynamic analysis for load prediction,             
              finite element analysis for stress prediction, and fatigue crack               
              propagation analysis for fatigue life prediction.  The feasibility             
              of automating this crack propagation life prediction method for                
              mechanical components is being demonstrated in an integrated                   
              analysis environment.                                                          
                   The Principal Investigator is competent and has the facilities            
              to perform the research.                                                       
                   The Program Manager recommends that Prairie View A & M                    
              University be awarded $100,000 for two (2) years.
