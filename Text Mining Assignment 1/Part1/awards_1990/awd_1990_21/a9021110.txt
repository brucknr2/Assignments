Abstract    :
              This award is to the National Academy of Science/National Research             
              Council Computer Science and Technology Board (CSTB) to convene a              
              study committee that brings together technology developers and users           
              to develop the specific research agenda necessary to support a                 
              national collaboratory.  Collaboratory, is the term for a complete             
              computer and communications support environment for remote and in              
              situ scientific investigation.  This includes access to distributed            
              data bases, remote control of instrumentation, and other features to           
              enable scientific work by teams of scientists not collocated with              
              each other or their scientific instruments.  The CSTB will identify            
              major scientific efforts that would significantly benefit from an              
              enhanced collaboration ability; it will assess the needs and                   
              requirements of these projects through a series of workshops                   
              involving both developers and potential users.  A report summarizing           
              the workshop findings and their implications for a national                    
              collaboratory research agenda will be prepared.  It is estimated               
              that the report will be available early in 1992.
