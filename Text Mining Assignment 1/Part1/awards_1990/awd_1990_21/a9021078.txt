Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project supports the dissertation research of a cultural                  
              anthropologist in highland Bolivia.  The research will examine                 
              Andean land-use focusing on the field fallowing choices of                     
              households and local resource management institutions.  The study              
              examines sectoral fallowing systems, which balance community                   
              control over agricultural decisions with individual farmer's                   
              decisions.  The project will examine the soil on a sample of                   
              farms to relate decisions about fallow strategies to soil                      
              quality.  Methods include participant observation, a sample                    
              survey of 130 farm families, and soil samples and analysis from                
              the interviewed farms and a sample of 30 fields in different                   
              agro-ecological zones.                                                         
                                                                                             
              This research is important because this area of the world has                  
              well-defined traditional community resource management                         
              institutions.  Understanding how specific institutions succeed or              
              fail in managing fundamental resources like soil is important to               
              help design conservation policies for other areas.
