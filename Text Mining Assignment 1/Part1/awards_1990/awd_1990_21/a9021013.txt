Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The aim of this project is to improve the teaching of                     
              meteorology and climatology at Memphis State University.  This                 
              will be accomplished by incorporating modern equipment and                     
              methods of receiving, manipulating and analyzing meteorological                
              data and images into the classroom.  The equipment purchased will              
              allow access, by receiving a satellite transmission, to the data               
              streams available from the University Center for Atmospheric                   
              Research (UCAR) Unidata Program Office and the National Weather                
              Service (NWS).  A workstation will be purchased that runs PC-                  
              McIDAS software, which is distributed at no cost by the UCAR                   
              Unidata Program.  Additionally, a DIFAX facsimile printer capable              
              of printing weather charts and other data transmitted via                      
              satellite from the National Meteorological Center of the NWS will              
              be acquired.                                                                   
                                                                                             
                   At the introductory level, the PC-McIDAS system will be used              
              to generate videotapes of sequences of satellite imagery for use               
              in illustrating principles in lecture.  Copies of weather maps                 
              made using the DIFAX printer will be used at all levels.  Upper                
              level students will get hands-on experience with the systems                   
              purchased.  These students will use each of these systems to do                
              weather analysis, forecasting and as a source of information for               
              exercises, problem solving and research papers.
