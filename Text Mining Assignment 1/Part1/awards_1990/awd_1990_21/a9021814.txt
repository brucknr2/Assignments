Abstract    :
              This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                
              award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to the                
              University of Alabama for the renovation and repair of Lloyd Hall              
              which houses the synthetic chemistry, biochemistry, and materials              
              science research and research training activities of the                       
              Department of Chemistry.  This building was constructed in 1931                
              and last renovated in 1980.  The ARFMP grant of $1,060,000 and                 
              $1,270,321 provided by the grantee as cost sharing will be used to             
              modernize these research and research training facilities.  This               
              project will address the need to improve the current research                  
              infrastructure in terms of health and safety as well as of                     
              quantity, quality, and efficiency of the research that can be                  
              conducted by (a) converting the former chemistry library for use               
              as research laboratory space; (b) installing additional or                     
              replacement fume hoods, additional electrical circuits, and                    
              gaseous nitrogen lines; (c) upgrading the building's heating,                  
              ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system; and (d)                       
              providing more safety equipment.                                               
                                                                                             
              This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                     
              providing an improved environment for the conduct of research and              
              for the training of undergraduate and graduate students.                       
              Penetration into new research areas made possible by this                      
              renovation will increase the productivity of the Department of                 
              Chemistry's graduate students and hence the role that the                      
              University of Alabama will be able to play in helping to meet the              
              nation's current and future scientific manpower needs.
