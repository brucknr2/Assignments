Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              One of the fundamental problems in neuroscience is                             
              understanding the multifaceted relationship between hormones and               
              behavior.  We know that hormone-regulated behaviors involve the                
              interactions between hormone-sensitive neural structures, and the              
              sensory and motor systems.  However, it is still not clear how                 
              the central nervous system integrates environmental stimuli                    
              impinging upon sensory receptors with an individual's                          
              physiological milieu and then outputs this information into                    
              appropriate behavioral responses.  Dr. Edwards'                                
              research program is aimed at providing answers to this important               
              problem.  Using a functional neuroanatomical approach in                       
              combination with an extensive series of behavioral tests, he will              
              define the neural pathways through which hormonal, chemosensory,               
              and somatosensory information are integrated towards the                       
              production of behavior.  Dr. Edwards will concentrate on the                   
              brain regions that are connected to the preoptic area, a nuclei                
              important for androgen-dependent behaviors.   He will evaluate                 
              the types of behavioral changes that result from the manipulation              
              of these specific brain structures and their afferent and                      
              efferent pathways.  This work will lead to a coherent picture of               
              the critical neural circuits involved in the expression of                     
              behavior.
