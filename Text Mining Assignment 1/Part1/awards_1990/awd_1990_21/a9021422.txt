Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Funds are being provided by the Developmental Biology, Theoretical             
              Chemistry and Materials Theory programs for support for this                   
              interdisciplinary workshop at Les Houches, February 19-28, 1991.               
              Dynamical processes at interfaces, surfaces and membranes play an              
              essential role in a great variety of fundamental phenomena and at              
              the same time exhibit specific features of reduced dimensionality.             
              The study of such phenomena is of great current interest in                    
              physics, chemistry and biology.  It is more and more evident that              
              studies made in these disciplines share many common features and               
              could be carried out in a more productive way if there were more               
              communication among researchers.  This winter school will make a               
              significant contribution to this effort.
