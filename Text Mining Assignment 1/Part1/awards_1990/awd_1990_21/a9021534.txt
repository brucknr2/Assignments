Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Oklahoma State University proposes a planning grant to                         
              establish an Alliance for minority Participation.  The                         
              proposed Alliance would involved minority students from                        
              throughout Oklahoma including those at Oklahoma State                          
              University, Langston University, our traditional minority                      
              campus, and other regional and private institutions.  The                      
              activities that would be carried out under the Alliance                        
              represent logical extensions, to support AMP goals, of                         
              programs which we currently have in operation in one or more                   
              of our units.  Our Alliance will include mentoring and                         
              community building activities on the several campuses,                         
              greatly increased research opportunities for minority                          
              students enrolled at the predominantly undergraduate                           
              institutions, and will address the critical bridges                            
              from high school to college and college to graduate school.                    
              A special feature of our Alliance will be the use of                           
              satellite television to deliver enrichment activities to the                   
              Alliance institutions.  Since these transmissions will be                      
              available nationwide, the program has the capability of                        
              immediate national impact.
