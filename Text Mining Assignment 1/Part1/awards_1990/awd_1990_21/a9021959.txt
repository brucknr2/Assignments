Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal studies surface alloy segregation in single crystal              
              and polycrystalline noble metal systems using angle-resolved Auger             
              electron spectroscopy and variable electron exit angles.  Single               
              crystals are oriented with low index surfaces exposed, and are                 
              characterized by low energy electron diffraction.  Process                     
              variables include temperature, alloy composition, and crystal                  
              orientation.  Of interest are the lattice strains arising from                 
              atomic size mismatch.  Calculations using the Embedded Atom Method             
              are used to model the composition depth profiles.  The subject of              
              surface segregation in metallic alloys is important to properties              
              and behavior.  Alloy systems selected should provide valuable                  
              addition to data base on surface segregation.
