Abstract    :
              Knowledge compilation (KC) converts explicitly represented domain              
              knowledge into an efficient algorithm for performing a task.  KC               
              technology could have a major impact in fields depending of                    
              efficient problem-solving algorithms.  For, example, productivity              
              in circuit and mechanical design has grown increasingly dependent              
              on efficient computer-aided design (CAD) tools.  KC techniques                 
              can accelerate CAD tool development and improve CAD tool                       
              reliability.  This work will develop knowledge compilation                     
              techniques for a variety of CAD applications.  Initially the work              
              will focus on spatial configuration problems.  Such problems                   
              arise in many domains, including VLSI design, mechanical design,               
              and architectural design.  It will focus on synthesizing search                
              algorithms composed of such components as generators, testers,                 
              and hillclimbing patchers organized into one or more levels of                 
              abstraction.  The research will develop an investigate a divide-               
              and-conquer approach to KC:  A problem specification is                        
              partitioned into parts; each part is assigned to be implemented                
              as a particular type of algorithm component.  This approach                    
              should avoid the control problems that arise in unrestricted                   
              transformational models of knowledge compilation.  Expected                    
              benefits of the research include articulated principles for the                
              synthesis of design algorithms, knowledge compilers implementing               
              such principles, and new CAD algorithms resulting from their                   
              application.
