Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              Most, if not all, languages have constructions which require                   
              'negative licensing', constructions whose occurence depends on                 
              the appearance of an expression of negation somewhere else in the              
              clause.  This project explores the phenomenon of Negative                      
              Licensing in several languages with differing clause structures,               
              highlighting the differences in Negative Licensing which follow                
              from the different ways in which these languages express the                   
              universal semantic and pragmatic category of negation.  The                    
              Research provides a fruitful testing-ground for current theories               
              of the relationship between the syntactic structure of a sentence              
              and its semantic structure.                                                    
                   There is considerable evidence that much of the                           
              crosslinguistic variation in Negative Licensing phenomena can be               
              attributed to the surface position of negation in different                    
              languages.  The investigators use the pattern of Negative                      
              Licensing as a probe in the investigation of the role played by                
              the negation-element in the syntactic organization of the clause.              
              The project will result in detailed analyses of the system of                  
              negation in several dialects of English, in Irish, and in several              
              other languages in addition to increasing our general                          
              understanding of the typology of clause structure in the                       
              languages of the world.
