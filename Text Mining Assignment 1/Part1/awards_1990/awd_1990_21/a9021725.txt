Abstract    :
              This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                
              award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to the                
              University of Wisconsin Madison for the renovation and repair of               
              facilities in two wings of the Engineering Building which house                
              the research and research training activities of the Department of             
              Chemical Engineering.  These wings were constructed in 1953 and                
              1962 and no major renovations have since been carried out.  The                
              ARFMP grant of $600,000 and $950,620 provided by the grantee as                
              cost sharing will be used to modernize these research and research             
              training facilities.  This project will address the need to improve            
              the current research infrastructure in terms of health and safety              
              as well as of quality, quantity, and diversity of research that can            
              be performed by upgrading the fume hood/ventilation system.  This              
              renovation is essential to licensing that will permit the continued            
              use of radioactive materials which are involved in a great deal of             
              the chemical research conducted in the Chemical Engineering                    
              laboratories.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              This award contributes to the infrastructure of science and                    
              engineering by providing an improved environment for the conduct               
              of research and for the training of quality undergraduate and                  
              graduate students.  The Department of Chemical Engineering at the              
              University of Wisconsin Madison is one of the world's foremost                 
              programs in this discipline, and it is one of the important                    
              producers of the nation's chemical engineers.
