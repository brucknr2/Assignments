Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research of Professor E. Canfield to              
              work in combinatorics.  He intends to investigate asymptotic                   
              behavior of solutions to recurrence equations, maps on surfaces,               
              cycle sizes in permutations, random partitions and Hamiltonian                 
              cycles in a class of random degree restricted graphs.                          
                   The research is in the general area of combinatorics.                     
              Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods to study how                  
              discrete collections of objects can be organized.  And, so it is               
              extremely important to modern communications, for example the                  
              design of large networks as in telephone systems and the design of             
              algorithms in computer science.
