Abstract    :
              This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                
              award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to                    
              Macalester College for the repair and renovation of Rice Hall of               
              Science which houses the research and research training activities             
              of the Departments of Biology, Geology, and Psychology.  This                  
              building was constructed in 1969 and has not been renovated since              
              that time.  The ARFMP grant of $350,000 and $350,112 provided by               
              the grantee as cost sharing will be used to modernize these                    
              research and research training facilities.  This project will                  
              address the need to improve the research infrastructure by                     
              reorganizing the current laboratories in order to provide more                 
              efficient use of space and to increase the size of the space for               
              research and research training in tissue culture, neurobiology,                
              groundwater hydrology, and the conduct of psychology experiments.              
                                                                                             
              This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                     
              providing an improved environment for the conduct of research and              
              for the training of quality undergraduate students, a relatively               
              high proportion of whom are from underrepresented minority groups.             
              These laboratories, which will now be able to accommodate the                  
              substantial amount state-of-the-art science equipment that                     
              Macalester has attracted from outside sources over the past five               
              years, are also available to students from four other colleges in              
              the Twin Cities.  The quality of the research conducted in them is             
              of importance to the collaborative efforts of the nine other                   
              liberal arts colleges and two research universities that are fellow            
              members of the Pew Midstates Science Consortium.
