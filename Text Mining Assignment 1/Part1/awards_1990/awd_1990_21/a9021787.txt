Abstract    :
              This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                
              award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to Morgan             
              State University for the renovation and repair of the Spencer and              
              Calloway wings of the Science Complex which house research and                 
              research training activities in biology, chemistry, and physics.               
              This building was constructed in 1953 and some renovation is                   
              currently underway.  This ARFMP grant of $186,325 and $575,000                 
              provided by the grantee as cost sharing will be used to modernize              
              these research and research training facilities.  This project will            
              address the need to improve the current research infrastructure by             
              reconfiguring the space, adding wall cabinets in the Student                   
              Research Laboratory, creating a molecular biology laboratory, and              
              installing wiring necessary for computer access by researchers.                
                                                                                             
              This award contributes to the infrastructure of science and                    
              engineering by providing an improved environment for the conduct               
              of research and for the training of undergraduate and graduate                 
              students.  The project will have an impact on minority student                 
              education and the entry and retention of minority students in the              
              human resources pipeline.  It will enable Morgan State University              
              to move forward more smoothly with its plans for expansion of                  
              graduate science programs to include master's degrees in biology,              
              chemistry, and physics and the doctoral degree in applied physics.
