Abstract    :
                   This work involves investigation of the social behavior of                
              the acorn woodpecker (Melanerpes formicivorus), a cooperatively                
              breeding species, using a completely color-banded population                   
              intensively monitored since 1971. Based on behavioral                          
              observations, groups of this species appear to consist of                      
              multiple reproductive males and females along with apparently                  
              nonbreeding offspring from prior years. However, complete                      
              understanding of the behavior of this species has been                         
              compromised by previous inability to precisely determine                       
              parentage within groups. This study will initiate efforts to                   
              address this problem using new molecular techniques that are able              
              to resolve uncertainties of parentage.                                         
                   Determination of parentage will contribute substantially to               
              the understanding of social behavior by clarifying the                         
              conflicting roles of competition and cooperation within the                    
              highly complex acorn woodpecker society. Such knowledge has                    
              potential applications to all fields involving the study of                    
              sociality including anthropology, sociology, and behavioral                    
              ecology.
