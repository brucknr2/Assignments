Abstract    :
              The profound change in conceptions of space, "from the closed world            
              to the infinite universe," has been matched by a parallel change               
              in conceptions of time, from a universe a few thousand years old               
              to one estimated in billions.  Those two historical developments               
              have been of equal cultural importance, but the latter is far less             
              understood.  This change in human understanding of time of our                 
              world should not be considered primarily as a mere expansion of the            
              timescale, but rather in terms of a reconstruction of the history              
              of nature.  The crucial period in the reconstruction of earth                  
              history was the early 19th century, during which a plethora of                 
              competing conjectures was replaced by a broadly consensual view                
              that is still embedded in the modern earth sciences.  The most                 
              decisive part of this research  was the reconstruction of                      
              geologically recent earth history (in modern terms, Cenozoic).                 
              This penetrated what was perceived as an epistemic barrier between             
              human and prehuman history, and clarified the enigmatic event                  
              (first conceived as a Deluge, later as an Ice Age) that marked that            
              boundary.  It is this later period that Professor Rudwick is                   
              examining in this fundamentally important study.
