Abstract    :
              This award provides travel funds for students                                  
              and young faculty to travel to an important                                    
              meeting in the field of microelectromechanical                                 
              engineering.  The meeting is Transducers '91,                                  
              which will be held in San Francisco, CA, in                                    
              June of 1991.  These travel funds will make it                                 
              possible for many graduate students to prepare                                 
              and present papers at this conference, and it                                  
              will enable young faculty beginning their                                      
              research careers to attend an important meeting.                               
              Participation by students and young faculty at                                 
              previous meetings has been highly beneficial                                   
              both to the people involved and the field.  This                               
              field is very young, and not many researchers                                  
              are well established with research support.                                    
              Thus, these travel grants play a key role in the                               
              development of the field.
