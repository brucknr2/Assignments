Abstract    :
              This research is concerned with the growth of single crystals of               
              high temperature superconductors, their materials characterization,            
              and the measurement of fundamental transport properties.  The                  
              research will be focused on three distinct classes of high Tc                  
              oxides; namely yttrium-praseodymium barium cuprate, neodymium-                 
              cerium cuprate, and yttrium barium copper-iron oxide.  The past                
              three years of high Tc work has demonstrated the importance of                 
              having quality single crystals.  In this program all of the work               
              will be done on single crystals so that anisotropy effects can be              
              studied studied in both the superconducting and normal states.                 
              Methods developed by this group for detwinning crystals permit the             
              direct examination of the role of twin boundaries on the                       
              superconducting properties such as, the magnetic flux motion.
