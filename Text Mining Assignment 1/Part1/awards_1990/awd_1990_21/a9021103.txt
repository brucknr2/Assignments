Abstract    :
              The purpose of this research is to identify and quantify the                   
              metal species that exist as a result of thermal degradation of                 
              hazardous waste.  To realize this objective three task have                    
              been formulated:                                                               
                                                                                             
                   1)  to review the literature for analytical methods which                 
                   have      been applied to the determination of metal                      
                   species                                                                   
                                                                                             
                   2)  to apply existing methods or develop new methods to                   
                   analyze for metal species in samples obtained from a                      
                   controlled combustion environment, and                                    
                                                                                             
                   3)  to modify or develop and test metal species sampling                  
                        systems                                                              
                                                                                             
              To this end, analytical methods using the currently available                  
              techniques of ion chromatography and X-ray diffraction to                      
              identify and quantify the metal species found in the gas phase                 
              of an experimental reactor will be developed, along with a                     
              sampling system for metal species.                                             
                                                                                             
              Future research will determine the effect of combustion                        
              parameters (e.g. temperature, chemical makeup, and residence                   
              time) on the metal species formed.  Knowledge of the actual                    
              species will be utilized to develop an algorithm to predict                    
              the fate of the metal constituents during rotary-kiln                          
              incineration.
