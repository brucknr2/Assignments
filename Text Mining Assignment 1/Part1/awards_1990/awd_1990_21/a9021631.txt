Abstract    :
              Dr. Halpin is attempting to show how physical theory, and quantum              
              mechanics in particular, can act as a guide to counterfactual                  
              logic.  Counterfactuals are statements about what would happen                 
              if, counter to fact, certain circumstances held.  Included                     
              amongst counterfactuals are important interpretative statements                
              in quantum mechanics about what would result and with what                     
              probability if a measurement were to be performed.  Over the past              
              several years, Dr. Halpin has developed various negative                       
              consequences of physical theory for counterfactual logic.  A                   
              number of influential counterfactual theories are inadequate, he               
              has shown, given basic facts of physics.  In contrast and more                 
              positively, reasoning from the physics also supports a new                     
              approach to the similarity analysis of counterfactuals.  It is                 
              this approach and its motivation which Dr. Halpin is examining.                
              Much of this research is specific to counterfactuals within the                
              quantum mechanical context.  This research includes the                        
              development of the logic of a probabilistic counterfactual meant               
              to explicate quantum mechanical probability attribution.
