Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research utilized numerical simulations and analytic                      
              approximations to study the physics of gravitational clustering in             
              an effort to understand the formation of large scale structure in              
              the universe.   Topological and percolation methods will be                    
              developed to assist in the application of the ideas developed to               
              actual observations.  Additional studies will investigate whether              
              radiation pressure could have provided the initial perturbations               
              which led to the formation of galaxies.
