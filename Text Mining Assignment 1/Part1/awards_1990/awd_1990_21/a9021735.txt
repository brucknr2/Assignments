Abstract    :
              This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                
              award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to                    
              Bermuda Biological Station for Research (BBSR) for the repair and              
              renovation of the Conklin Laboratories which house research and                
              research training activities in biology, chemistry, and                        
              oceanography.  This building was constructed in 1961 and last                  
              renovated in 1980.  The ARFMP grant of $200,000 and $238,725                   
              provided by the grantee as cost sharing will be used to modernize              
              these research and research training facilities.  This project                 
              will address the need to improve the current research                          
              infrastructure so as to strengthen existing programs and encourage             
              more sophisticated research.  The renovation will provide high                 
              standards of power, solvent and chemical storage, seawater, and                
              computer network infrastructure in a location which presents                   
              particularly difficult problems for many areas of laboratory                   
              operations.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                     
              providing an improved research and research training environment               
              to an increasing number of scientists and students wishing to take             
              advantage of the key location of BBSR for the pursuit of new                   
              initiatives in global geosciences and marine molecular biology.
