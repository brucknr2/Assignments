Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The regulation of cell metabolism is a complex process, occurring              
              at different levels during development.  Important metabolic                   
              enzymes, such as ketone bodies enzymes, are differentially                     
              expressed in other cells from brain.  During development, ketone               
              bodies are an important source of energy for metabolism and serve              
              as precursors for lipid synthesis in brain.  The Principal                     
              investigator is interested in how glucocorticoids, steroid                     
              hormones, stimulate the activity of a ketone body metabolizing                 
              enzyme, 3-ketoacid CoA transferase.  This research project will                
              investigate how glucocorticoid hormones influence the metabolic                
              activity of oligodentrocytes, specialized glial cells which form               
              myelin sheaths, the insulating layer surrounding axons.                        
              Experiments using cultures of oligodentrocytes will be used to                 
              study the various steps in the synthesis of coenzyme A                         
              transferase.  Studies will be performed to determine the effect                
              of glucocorticoids on the transcription of gene coding for this                
              enzyme.  As the myelin sheath assures integrity of transmission                
              in the nervous system, this research has far reaching                          
              implications for neurobiology.
