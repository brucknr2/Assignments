Abstract    :
              This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                
              award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to Luther             
              College for the renovation, repair, and partial replacement of                 
              Valders Hall which houses that institution's biology and chemistry             
              research and research training activities.  This building was                  
              constructed in 1961 and last renovated in 1987.  The ARFMP grant of            
              $125,000 and $148,078 provided by the grantee as cost sharing will             
              be used to modernize these research and research training                      
              facilities.  This project will address the need to improve the                 
              current research infrastructure in terms of health and safety as               
              well as of the quality and quantity of research that can be                    
              conducted by replacing the ornamental greenhouse with a climate-               
              controlled prefabricated research greenhouse; converting existing              
              greenhouse space into research cubicles for student research                   
              projects; and modernizing rooms so as to accommodate computer                  
              networking and to house the impressive collection of research-                 
              caliber chemistry instruments that have been acquired in recent                
              years and are presently scattered in five locations.                           
                                                                                             
              This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                     
              providing an improved environment for the conduct of research and              
              for the training of quality undergraduate students in an                       
              institution that has a strong track record of training students                
              for science careers.
