Abstract    :
                The research objective of this grant under the SGER (Small                   
              Grants for Exploratory Research) program is to generate and                    
              detect elastic interface waves that can propagate along a                      
              fracture.  The existence of these waves has been predicted                     
              theoretically for appropriate mechanical properties of the                     
              fracture and frequencies of excitation.  Using ultrasonic                      
              frequencies, these waves will be generated and measured initially              
              for a synthetic fracture in aluminum, and then in a natural rock               
              specimen.  If successful, this research will result in the first               
              observation of elastic interface waves.  There is a potential for              
              the development of these waves as diagnostic tools in borehole                 
              geophysics and mine safety.
