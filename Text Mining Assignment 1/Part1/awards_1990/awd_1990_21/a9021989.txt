Abstract    :
              This research addresses the problem of adjusting, or correcting,               
              the analytical model of a structure to agree with experimentally               
              measured data.  Typically, in vibration modeling, models                       
              determined analytically (i.e., by the finite element analysis                  
              (FEA) method) are compared with experimental modal analysis (EMA)              
              data.  Numerous incompatibilities generally exist between the                  
              analytical models and the experimentally obtained data, and the                
              view is taken that the analytical model is in error and must be                
              refined and corrected based on the experimental data.  This                    
              research recognizes that the model correction problem is similar               
              to the statement of the eigenstructure assignment problem and                  
              pole placement problem common to control theory.  The intent here              
              is to utilize the control theory algorithms to solve the model                 
              correction problem by adjusting the algorithms to take advantage               
              of differences between EMA and FEA data.  The theory developed                 
              will be subjected to verification through tests on a number of                 
              laboratory structures.
