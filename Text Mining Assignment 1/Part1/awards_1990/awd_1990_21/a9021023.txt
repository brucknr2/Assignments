Abstract    :
              This U.S.-Italy award will support a workshop on knowledge,                    
              beliefs, and strategic interactions.  The activity, which is                   
              being jointly organized by Professor Christina Bicchieri of                    
              Carnegie-Mellon University and Professor Maria Luisa Dalla                     
              Chiara of the University of Florence, will serve to bring                      
              together philosophers and economists (game theorists) to                       
              explore several issues of cross-disciplinary interest.  Thus,                  
              it is expected that philosophers can provide game theorists                    
              some useful insights into foundational problems and techniques                 
              that may help to develop more powerful game theory models.                     
              At the same time, game theorists can furnish philosophers                      
              with important new problems and applications.                                  
                                                                                             
              This workshop follows after a similar successful inter-                        
              disciplinary  workshop that took place in Italy over two                       
              years ago.  Expected outcomes from this meeting are a                          
              proceedings publication and increased interaction between                      
              philosophers and game theorists.  Support from the                             
              Italian Interuniversity Center for Game Theory and the                         
              Florence Center for the History and Philosophy of Science                      
              will make possible the participation of other distinguished                    
              European and Israeli researchers.
