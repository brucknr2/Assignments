Abstract    :
              This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                
              award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to North              
              Dakota State University for the renovation and repair of two                   
              adjoining buildings, Ladd Hall and Dunbar Laboratories, which                  
              house that institution's chemical research and research training               
              activities.  These buildings were constructed, respectively, in                
              1913 and 1963, and last renovated in 1979.  The ARFMP grant of                 
              $600,000 and $600,000 provided by the grantee as cost sharing will             
              be used to modernize these research and research training                      
              facilities and to foster greater interactions by locating related              
              research laboratories in close proximity to one another.  This                 
              project will address the need to improve the current research                  
              infrastructure by providing an upgraded heating, ventilation, and              
              air-conditioning (HVAC) system and by rehabilitating basement                  
              research and research training space  to accomodamodate two laser              
              laboratories.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                     
              providing an improved environment for the conduct of research and              
              for the training of quality undergraduate and graduate students.               
              Students trained in these laboratories have the benefit of having              
              been educated in consistently productive programs, including the               
              North Dakota State University's unique program in polymers and                 
              coatings.
