Abstract    :
              This project will replace a wooden pier and its outdated                       
              electrical services at the Duke Marine Laboratory which provides               
              home port facilities for the NSF-owned R/V CAPE HATTERAS.  The                 
              present pier, built in the early 1960's has deteriorated to the                
              point that it is unsafe for vehicles that must use it to service               
              the ship.  The cost will be shared with Duke University.  The                  
              University which has already funded an engineering study, will be              
              responsible for the south pier and trestle which services small                
              boats, and NSF funds will be used for a new concrete north pier                
              and trestle plus electrical service improvements.  The new pier                
              will significantly reduce maintenance costs and should see many                
              years of service.
