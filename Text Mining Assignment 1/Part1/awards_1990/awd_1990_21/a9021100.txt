Abstract    :
                   This research concerns continuation of precise astronomical               
              measurements related to solar variability, the relation between                
              solar activity and planetary weather, and variations in the                    
              transparency of the Earth's atmosphere.  New evidence for a                    
              relationship between solar output and planetary "weather" comes                
              from the planet Neptune, whose global albedo has indicated cyclic              
              variations associated with solar cycle.  Telescopic and Voyager                
              spacecraft images combined with photometry relate the brightness               
              variations to transiting stratospheric clouds of frozen methane.               
              This work will include further multispectral continuum and                     
              methane-band photometry and collaborative infrared imaging of                  
              Neptune, plus comparative measurements of Titan and Uranus which               
              also vary in brightness during solar max 91, to test competing                 
              solar-weather theories involving UV driven photochemistry and                  
              cosmic-ray induced nucleation.  A series of indirect solar                     
              brightness measurements derived from photometry of the Galilean                
              satellites of Jupiter will also be completed.  The 1976-1992                   
              photometry encloses the 1980-1989 era of precise solar radiometry              
              by the Solar Maximum Mission (SMM) and will test the veracity of               
              a reported 0.4% solar brightness increase between 1976 and 1978.               
              Finally, using multicolor nighttime stellar and daytime solar                  
              photometry, a long series of aerosol and ozone extinction                      
              measurements will be made to look for systematic trends and                    
              diurnal variations.
