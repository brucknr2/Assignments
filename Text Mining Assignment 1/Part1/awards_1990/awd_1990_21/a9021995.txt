Abstract    :
              The proposed project encompasses an experimental and theoretical               
              study of full-size and small-scale reinforced concrete flexural                
              members subjected to high rate loads representative of real-life               
              events affecting buildings and infrastructure.  Loads will be                  
              applied by direct impact (open-loop) and at constant displacement              
              rate (closed-loop), such that the strain rate ranges generated by              
              the two methods will overlap.  The primary objectives of the                   
              project are: 1) to improve the fundamental understanding of                    
              reinforced concrete response at varying load rates; 2) to analyze              
              and predict behavior and failure modes of full-size structural                 
              members as affected by selected design variables; and 3) to                    
              establish a performance relationship between models and full-size              
              members.
