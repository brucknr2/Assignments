Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program                 
              will help the Department of Chemistry at the University of                     
              Colorado at Boulder acquire an Electron Paramagnetic Resonance                 
              (EPR) spectrometer with variable temperature controls.  The EPR                
              will be used by five faculty members to characterize free                      
              radical reactive intermediates in a variety of liquid and solid                
              organic systems.                                                               
                                                                                             
              Electron resonance is a branch of absorption spectroscopy in                   
              which radiation of microwave frequency is absorbed by molecules                
              possessing electrons with unpaired spins.  In electron                         
              paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR) two different energy                 
              states arise when a magnetic field is applied and a transition                 
              between the two different electron spin energy states occurs                   
              upon absorption of a quantum of radiation in the microwave                     
              region.  When an unpaired electron comes in the vicinity of a                  
              nucleus with a spin, an interaction takes place which causes                   
              the absorption signal to be split into several components.                     
              From this interaction molecular structure can be inferred.  EPR                
              spectroscopy is also used in studies of the rates of reactions                 
              and in studies involving radical intermediates produced in a                   
              reaction.
