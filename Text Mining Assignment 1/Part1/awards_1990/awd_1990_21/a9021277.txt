Abstract    :
                   The eclipse occurring during July 11, 1991 passes directly                
              over the Mauna Loa Solar Observatory, Hawaii.  This permits the                
              rare opportunity to obtain a direct cross-calibration between the              
              High Altitude Observatory (HAO) K-coronameter, located on Mauna                
              Loa, and the HAO coronal camera, alleviating many of the                       
              uncertainties which have compromised comparisons in the past.                  
              The eclipse will permit the solar corona to be measured                        
              simultaneously by both instruments under identical viewing                     
              conditions, thus permitting a measure of the stray light, and a                
              more accurate absolute calibration of the K-coronameter then                   
              previously attainable. The high altitude observing site,                       
              favorable meteorological conditions and the eclipse                            
              characteristics all promise a high probability of successful                   
              observations by both instruments.  Recent laboratory                           
              calibrations of the photometric standards used by these                        
              instruments suggest that a significantly improved absolute                     
              determination of the coronal brightness, polarization-                         
              brightness product, and resultant electron density will be                     
              possible.
