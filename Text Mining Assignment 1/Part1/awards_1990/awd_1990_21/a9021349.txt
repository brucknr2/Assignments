Abstract    :
              The proposed research is a combined theoretical and                            
              experimental investigation of the structural and rheological                   
              properties of colloidal dispersions.  The effective medium                     
              properties are incorporated in a statistical theory to                         
              evaluate pair of particle interactions.  The calculation of                    
              the structure and rheological properties for a variety of                      
              systems is proposed.  The theory will be tested via light                      
              scattering measurements, for mixtures of hard spheres, sticky                  
              spheres and spheres bearing grafted polymer layers.  The                       
              statistical mechanics approach can be regarded as an                           
              alternative or complement to molecular dynamics or Stokesian                   
              simulations, covering dilute and medium concentrated                           
              dispersions.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              The suggested theory should be valuable for the fundamental                    
              information generated, as well as the insight gained for                       
              guiding and correlating experiments for colloidal dispersions                  
              of interest in automotive and architectural coatings, ceramic                  
              particles processed as dispersions, cosmetics, and printing                    
              inks.
