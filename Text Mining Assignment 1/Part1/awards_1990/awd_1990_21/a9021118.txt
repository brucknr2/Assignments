Abstract    :
              The proposed research is for the development of the concept,                   
              design, and implementation of a software-support/reconfigurable-               
              hardware platform that accepts an application program, written in              
              C, and automatically generates both the hardware-configuration data            
              and the program to execute on a reconfigured hardware.  The initial            
              application programs to be looked at are the kernel algorithms                 
              currently used in speech processing, distributed decision-making,              
              computer vision, CAD of digital systems, robotics, and signal                  
              processing algorithms.  New Conversion techniques for the expanded             
              set of C functions will be developed.  The construction of a                   
              limited hardware platform to verify the expected advantages of the             
              software system will be studied.
