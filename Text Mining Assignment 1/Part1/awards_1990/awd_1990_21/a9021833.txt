Abstract    :
              This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP) award          
              from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to Columbia                 
              University for the renovation and repair of the William S. Black               
              Research Building of the College of Physicians & Surgeons, which after         
              the modernization, will house structural studies, a multi-disciplinary         
              research and research training program in molecular biophysics.  This          
              building was constructed in 1965 and has not previously been renovated.        
              The ARFMP grant of $700,000 and $903,000 provided by the grantee as cost       
              sharing will be used to modernize these research and research training         
              facilities.  It will make possible new research capabilities and               
              collaborative interaction not possible under current conditions.  This         
              project will address the need to improve the current research                  
              infrastructure by conversion of research and research training space so        
              as to permit consolidation of related work in structural biology and by        
              upgrading the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) so that        
              it is suitable to meet the demands of x-ray diffraction and of the             
              computer facilities.                                                           
                                                                                             
              This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by providing an        
              improved environment for the conduct of research and for the training of       
              quality undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students and for             
              fostering academic-industrial ties.  Students trained in these                 
              laboratories will be able to serve as models for the feasibility of the        
              training of computer-literate molecular biologists.
