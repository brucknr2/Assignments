Abstract    :
              The goal of this research is to elucidate the hydrogen                         
              microstructure surrounding passivated defects on crystalline                   
              semiconductors employing nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)                      
              spectroscopy.  Quantitative NMR measurements characterizing                    
              hydrogen surrounding passivated defects in silicon and also bulk               
              molecular hydrogen in bulk silicon will be made.  Studies will be              
              initiated with the boron-hydrogen complex in heavily doped silicon             
              and then extended to other dopants such as aluminum, gallium and               
              indium, and could eventually lead to studies of dopants in                     
              germanium.  Proton and other nuclei's NMR parameters such as                   
              quadrupolar couplings, chemical shifts, dipolar oscillations, and              
              relaxation times will be determined and related to site symmetries,            
              electric field gradients, bond lengths, and atomic mobilities at               
              low and elevated temperatures.  These results will be important in             
              understanding the role of hydrogen in semiconductor processing and             
              in confirming theoretical models and calculations of passivation               
              phenomena.
