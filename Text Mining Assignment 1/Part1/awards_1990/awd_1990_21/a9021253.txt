Abstract    :
                   This award provides partial support for an extended workshop              
              and a conference on turbulence in optics and plasmas under the                 
              US-USSR Cooperative Science Program.  These activities are                     
              envisioned as the step in a program of sustained interaction                   
              between scientists in the US and the USSR in the general area of               
              nonlinear studies.  These efforts will involve both theoretical                
              and experimental scientists with an emphasis on inclusion of new               
              researchers.                                                                   
                   The problem of turbulence is one of the most challenging in               
              the interface between physics and mathematics.  It is a                        
              fundamental problem not only for hydrodynamics but for plasma                  
              physics, astrophysics and nonlinear optics.  It is now realized                
              that many different types of turbulence have the same                          
              characteristic feature - the nucleation, formation and                         
              dissipation of special singular coherent structures. These are                 
              related to singularities of the solutions of the governing                     
              partial differential equations and are responsible for two key                 
              processes in turbulence - the production of small-scale motion                 
              and the dissipation of energy.  These areas will be explored in                
              an extended workshop and a conference under the auspices of the                
              US-USSR Cooperative Science Program.
