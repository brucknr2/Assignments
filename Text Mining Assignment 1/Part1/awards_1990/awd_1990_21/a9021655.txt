Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The choroid plexuses, which lie in the ventricles of the brain,                
              are the major producers of the cerebrospinal fluid which bathes                
              the mammalian nervous system.  These tissues are critical to the               
              maintenance of the fluid environment which surrounds and cushions              
              the brain and spinal chord.  A number of receptors for insulin                 
              and insulin-like growth factors have been localized, however, the              
              correlation between these growth factors and the central nervous               
              system has not been determined.  This research project will                    
              examine the effects of insulin-like growth factors on the choroid              
              plexus ion transport mechanisms which are essential to                         
              cerebrospinal fluid formation.  The intermediate steps in the                  
              cellular responses to the insulin-like growth factors will be                  
              identified.  Comparisons will be made between the mature and                   
              infant rat; choroid plexus transport capability and cerebrospinal              
              fluid production are not fully developed in infant rats, and                   
              specific insulin-like growth factor receptor density varies with               
              age.  This research will establish a link between growth factor-               
              receptor coupling and choroid plexus physiology and will identify              
              the developmental differences in insulin-like growth factor                    
              action on the choroid plexus.
