Abstract    :
              This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                
              award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to                    
              Stanford University for the renovation and repair of the Stauffer              
              building complex which houses a portion of the research and                    
              research training activities in Chemistry and Chemical                         
              Engineering.  This building was constructed in 1961 and last                   
              renovated in 1989.  The ARFMP grant of $1,500,000 and $4,375,000               
              provided by the grantee as cost sharing will be used to modernize              
              these research and research training facilities so as to meet the              
              significant new demands placed on them by research in these fields             
              and the requirements for the safe practice of that research.  This             
              project will address the need to improve the current research                  
              infrastructure by systematically upgrading major building systems              
              and by selectively renovating individual laboratories to conform to            
              recent building and fire codes.  Top priority will be given to the             
              renovation of the intake/exhaust systems including the replacement             
              of all existing fume hoods for safety, economic, and research                  
              quality considerations.                                                        
                                                                                             
              This award contributes to the infrastructure of science and                    
              engineering by providing an improved environment for the conduct               
              of research and for the training of quality undergraduate and                  
              graduate students.  This project will enable two leading research              
              and research training departments to continue to provide not only              
              an outstanding environment but one with an increased capacity for              
              training the excellent students it attracts.  Students trained in              
              these laboratories are in demand in both basic and applied                     
              research fields.
