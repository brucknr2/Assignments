Abstract    :
              This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                
              award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to                    
              California State University Los Angeles for the renovation and                 
              repair of the Biological Sciences Building which houses that                   
              institution's biological and microbiological research and research             
              training activities.  This building was constructed in 1958 and has            
              not been renovated since that time.  The ARFMP grant of $750,000               
              and $1,032,000 provided by the grantee as cost sharing will be used            
              to modernize these research and research training facilities.  This            
              project will address the need to improve the current research                  
              infrastructure both in terms of health and safety and of the                   
              quality, quantity, and diversity of research that can be undertaken            
              by redesigning the work space in a number of individual                        
              laboratories and by bringing the power and heating, ventilation,               
              and air conditioning (HVAC) systems up to standard.                            
                                                                                             
              This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                     
              providing an improved environment for the conduct of research and              
              for the training of primarily undergraduate students in an                     
              institution with a particular commitment to and a successful                   
              record of recruiting and educating underrepresented minorities.                
              The modernization supported will significantly increase the                    
              numbers of such ethnic minorities who may receive research                     
              training and be exposed to modern scientific methods and                       
              techniques in the biological sciences.
