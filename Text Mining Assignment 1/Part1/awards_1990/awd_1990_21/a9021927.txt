Abstract    :
              The research will deal with two basic issues.  The first topic is              
              friction on microscopic scales.  In conjunction with the work on               
              electrostatic micro-motors, there has been an attempt made to                  
              characterize static friction in solid state devices using a                    
              structure etched into silicon.  This device is quite clever, and               
              results are providing new insight into friction on microscopic                 
              scales, but its application is limited to determination of static              
              friction coefficients for materials used on semiconductors.  Using             
              magnetically driven machines similar to those already being worked             
              with, the work can be extended to experimental determination of                
              static and dynamic friction coefficients of various materials.  The            
              second basic topic is small scale bond yield strengths.  Virtually             
              all microelectronic devices are connected to packages via leads                
              bonded to the periphery of the device, yet little is known about               
              the mechanical behavior of these bonds.  A database of bond                    
              stress/strain information is to be developed and the information               
              will be used to develop a predictive model of bond behavior.                   
              Preliminary work suggests that the size of any voids in the bond               
              should be able to be determined from force/displacement                        
              information.  This fundamental research will help  determine levels            
              of bond stress that are truly nondestructive, and should ultimately            
              permit the development of a nondestructive bond quality monitoring             
              machine for use in the manufacture of all miniature electronic and             
              electromechanical items.
