Abstract    :
              This is a two-year collaborative research project between Dr.                  
              Robert Youngs, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State                        
              University and Professor Wang Hsiu Hwa, National Pingtung                      
              Institute of Agriculture supported by the AIT (U.S.) - CCNAA                   
              (Taiwan) Cooperative Science Program.  This proposal plans to                  
              study the relationship between removing moisture from wood                     
              and developments of microfractures using numerical models and                  
              laboratory experiments include the determination of stresses                   
              that develop during early stages of drying redwood and                         
              Castanopsis carlesli, a Taiwan species resembling red oak in                   
              structure.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              Microfractures are a major problem in wood products.  They                     
              can greatly reduce the quality of wood and lower the value of                  
              the wood products, and are a principal source of loss of                       
              value wood products between the US and Taiwan.  The result                     
              of this research can provide useful information for                            
              understanding the development of microfractures in wood and                    
              wood products and reduce the damage in wood during shipping,                   
              storage and processing.  This project is jointly supported by                  
              the NSF and the Taiwan National Science Council.
