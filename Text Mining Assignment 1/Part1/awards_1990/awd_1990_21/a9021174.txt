Abstract    :
                   Reliability and Quality are closely related concepts dealing              
              with improvement of product quality.  In this age of high-tech                 
              industry, the development of technology to ensure consistent                   
              performance, quality and reliability of materials are of                       
              considerable interest.  Because of the magnitude of the                        
              expenditures involved and the pressure to make early decisions                 
              correctly, it has been necessary to devise suitable statistical                
              techniques that would enable the experimenter to make valid                    
              statistical decisions even before the experiment is terminated.                
              Thus reliability and quality have proven to be areas of research               
              related to national need.                                                      
                   This grant will partially support a conference on Reliability             
              at the University of Missouri in June, 1991.  Participants will                
              include representatives from the academic, the industrial and the              
              governmental spheres.  The interaction of these engineers and                  
              statisticians should prove to be beneficial for future development             
              of much needed process improvements methodology.
