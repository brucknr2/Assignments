Abstract    :
              This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                
              award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to Duke               
              University for the renovation and repair of the Biological                     
              Sciences Building which houses that institution's Departments of               
              Botany and Zoology and the School of Forestry and Environmental                
              Studies and thus its systematics, ecology, physiology, genetics,               
              cell, molecular, and other biological research and research                    
              training activities.  This building was constructed in 1961, and               
              there has been no renovation of the building's basic systems since             
              its construction.  The ARFMP grant of $1,900,000 and $2,939,335                
              provided by the grantee as cost sharing will be used to modernize              
              these research and research training facilities.  This project will            
              address the need to improve the current research infrastructure by             
              providing conditions compatible with new techniques and                        
              methodologies of biology which require accurate environmental                  
              control, stable and sufficient electrical power, pure water supply,            
              and ready access to local and international computer networks.  The            
              renovation will also assure a flexible infrastructure enabling the             
              support of developing and currently unforeseen areas of biological             
              investigation that could not otherwise be pursued.                             
                                                                                             
              This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                     
              providing an improved environment for the conduct of research and              
              for the training of quality undergraduate and graduate students.               
              Students trained in these laboratories will have access to a                   
              stable, reliable environment which is necessary for the                        
              preservation of collections, for long-term experimentation and                 
              research, and for the operation of computers and sophisticated                 
              scientific equipment.
