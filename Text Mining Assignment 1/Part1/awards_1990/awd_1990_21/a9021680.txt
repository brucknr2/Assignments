Abstract    :
              Measurements of optical activity have long played an essential                 
              role in the development of organic chemistry and biochemistry.                 
              The study of optical rotatory dispersion (ORD) or circular                     
              dichroism (CD) provides important information about the                        
              electronic states or structures of individual molecules or                     
              ions.  These techniques are used when studying  absolute                       
              configurations of molecules, reaction mechanisms and kinetics,                 
              asymmetric or stereospecific syntheses, thermodynamic                          
              properties of dissolved species, and many other stereochemical                 
              problems.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program                 
              to the Department of Chemistry at the University of Colorado at                
              Boulder will help them acquire a Circular Dichrograph.  The                    
              acquisition will enhance chemical research in the following                    
              areas:
