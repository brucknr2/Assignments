Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The major goal of this research is to investigate the role of                  
              affect in persuasion and to examine the utility of the                         
              Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM) for understanding and                       
              integrating prior research on affect.  ELM holds that affect                   
              influences the amount and direction of persuasion by different                 
              processes in different situations.  That is, peoples' moods and                
              feelings can influence attitudes by (a) serving as simple cues;                
              (b) providing issue-relevant information; (c) affecting the                    
              extent of information processing activity, and (d) influencing                 
              the nature of the thoughts that come to mind as a message is                   
              processed.  Affect is postulated to have different effects                     
              depending upon a message recipient's overall motivation and                    
              ability to think about the communication.                                      
                                                                                             
              Experiments will be conducted to examine the different roles that              
              a person's affective state can play in the persuasion process                  
              under different elaboration likelihood conditions.  These are the              
              critical experiments for testing the potential utility of the ELM              
              for understanding the role of a person's transient moods and                   
              emotions in persuasion.  When this research has been completed,                
              we will have a better understanding of the link between affect                 
              and persuasion.
