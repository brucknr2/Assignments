Abstract    :
                   This grant will partially support a conference on                         
              computational number theory and combinatorics at Northern Illinois             
              University in May, 1991.  Held in honor of John Selfridge and the              
              contributions he has made to both these fields, the conference                 
              topics will concern practical computing and its relationship to                
              mathematical research.  The invited speakers will lecture on the               
              current state of research in these areas, and will help delineate              
              future research directions and stimulate the research of                       
              investigators, especially young mathematicians, working in these               
              areas.
