              The Coalition to Increase Minority Doctorates is a                             
              sequenced, comprehensive academic achievement program with                     
              the long-term objective to produce an additional 100                           
              minority Ph.D.'s per year in mathematics, science, and                         
              engineering-related fields.  Shorter-term objectives                           
              (through academic year 1995-1996) are to serve 43,000                          
              precollegiate, 2,000 undergraduate, and 500 graduate                           
              students.
