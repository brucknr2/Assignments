Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
                  The project is an experimental investigation into the use of              
              distinct types of information during sentence comprehension.                   
              Pilot work supports the view that syntactic processing is                      
              "informationally encapsulated" in that certain types of                        
              information fail to influence or guide syntactic processing, even              
              in contexts where such information may be useful.  Such                        
              encapsulation allows for a computationally efficient parse (in                 
              linear time).                                                                  
                   Specifically there is a sharp contrast between the                        
              utilization of information such as category, subcategory, number,              
              and case specification and information such as animacy and                     
              abstractness features.                                                         
                   The investigators will use four experimental tasks:  (i)                  
              lexical decision (Wright & Garrett 1984); (ii) Word-by-word                    
              syntactic decision (Stowe 1989); (iii) word-monitoring (Marslen-               
              Wilson & Tyler 1980), and (iv) the probe task.  Both the word-by-              
              word syntactic decision task and the word-monitoring task involve              
              problems which limit their usefulness in experiments attempting                
              to shed light on the issue of encapsulation.                                   
                   The issue of encapsulation is related to the issue of                     
              computational efficiency because the domains in which concord                  
              relations are established varies from feature to feature.  The                 
              probe task will be used to investigate the role of the c-command               
              domain in syntactic processing.                                                
                   In general, the aim is to conduct experiments which pilot                 
              work indicates will support a particular view of human sentence                
              comprehension, i.e. the process of human sentence comprehension                
              distinguishes the use of lexically-specified and general                       
              syntactic information from the use of semantic or pragmatic                    
              information, even when syntactic information is ambiguous.
