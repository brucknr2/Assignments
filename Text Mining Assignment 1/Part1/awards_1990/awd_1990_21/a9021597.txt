Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The long term goal of Dr. Hirsch's research is to analyze the                  
              steps involved in nodule development, and also to unravel the                  
              genetic contributions of two very different organisms, microbe                 
              and plant, in the establishment of a nitrogen fixing root nodule.              
              The nodule is a particularly interesting developmental system                  
              because it forms only under conditions of nitrogen stress; plants              
              grown with sufficient nitrogen do to develop nodules. Hence, Dr.               
              Hirsch's focuses on the genes expressed early in nodule formation              
              because they herald the onset of a new developmental pathway, one              
              which has far reaching ecological and agronomic importance. The                
              specific objectives of this proposal are: 1) to determine whether              
              bacteria free nodules differ significantly in their development                
              from wild type R. meliloti induced nodules, and 2) to determine                
              whether a cell division factor is produces independently of the                
              root hair deformation factor. This research project will not only              
              extend our understanding of plant microbe interactions, but also               
              lay the foundation for future attempts to develop novel nitrogen               
              fixing crop plants.
