Abstract    :
              This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                
              award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to Harvey             
              Mudd College for the renovation and repair of Jacobs Science Center            
              which houses the research and research training activities of the              
              Departments of Chemistry and Physics.  This building was                       
              constructed in 1959 and last renovated in 1960.  The ARFMP grant of            
              $1,025,000 and $1,025,090 provided by the grantee as cost sharing              
              will be used to modernize these research and research training                 
              facilities.  This project will address the need to improve the                 
              current research infrastructure in terms of health and safety as               
              well as of the quality, quantity, and diversity of research that               
              can be carried out.  The modernization will involve gutting the                
              building, restructuring laboratories, and completely rebuilding the            
              electrical, plumbing, safety, and heating, ventilation, and air                
              conditioning (HVAC) systems.  The renovation will result not only              
              in the ability to maintain, but also in a significant enhancement              
              of, the already excellent level of research training.                          
                                                                                             
              This award contributes to the infrastructure of science and                    
              engineering by providing an improved environment for the conduct               
              of research and for the training of quality undergraduate students             
              in the Chemistry and Physics Departments which are projected to                
              have a large increase in the number of majors.  Harvey Mudd, a                 
              science college with a highly regarded curriculum, traditionally               
              sends two-thirds of its baccalaureates to graduate school.
