Abstract    :
                   The study of determinantal ideals has a long history in                   
              mathematics; in algebra, analysis and geometry.  In particular, the            
              study of generic matrices plays a central role in commutative                  
              algebra and algebraic geometry.  The search over the past thirty               
              years for a universal resolution of the ideal generated by the                 
              minors of order p of the m x n generic matrix has been intimately              
              linked with the representation theory of the general linear group.             
                 This grant will partially support a conference devoted to the               
              subject of determinantal ideals and representation theory, to be               
              held April 18-20, 1991 at the University of Arkansas.  The                     
              principal lecturer will be David Buchsbaum from Brandeis                       
              University.  The effectiveness of the conference also depends on               
              the supporting speakers who will give shorter talks, and on the                
              presence of young researchers and graduate students.
