Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This study is designed to determine whether nerve cell to nerve                
              cell interactions direct or influence the short cell body                      
              projections called dendrites and the synaptic connectivity                     
              between nerve cells which takes place in the central nervous                   
              system during development.  Cell to cell interactions as well as               
              steroid hormones have been implicated in regulating the                        
              postembryonic structure of nerve cells.  This study uses the moth              
              to examine individual nerve cells during hormonally-controlled                 
              metamorphosis.  Hormonal, surgical and chemical manipulations are              
              used to determine if the interactions between nerve cells trigger              
              or shape the growth of dendrites on the cell body.                             
              Electrophysiological and morphological methods are used to define              
              the changes that take place in dendritic growth. These studies                 
              will contribute to our understanding of how nerve cells interact               
              and how hormones affect nerve cell structure during development.
