Abstract    :
                   This project investigates the genetic consequences of being               
              an extreme ecological specialist in a rare and vanishing habitat.              
              The Florida Scrub Jay is a federally Threatened bird species,                  
              restricted to a habitat that is rapidly being eliminated by man.               
              Twenty-two years of detailed study of a marked population have                 
              shown that these jays have an unusual social system, and rarely                
              move more than a few territories from where they were hatched.                 
              This very limited dispersal may result in rapid development of                 
              genetic changes over short distances, especially within a habitat              
              that is highly fragmented.  A variety of sophisticated genetic                 
              techniques (DNA 'fingerprinting' and sequencing) will be used to               
              examine genetic variation at both local and regional scales.                   
              Specific goals are to: 1) confirm that reproduction takes place                
              only by the mated pair on each territory (i.e., extra-pair or                  
              extra-territorial fertilizations are rare or absent); 2) test                  
              whether levels of inbreeding affect lifetime reproductive                      
              performance; 3) compare the effects of distance, degree of                     
              habitat isolation, and population size on genetic variation and                
              differentiation, and 4) test whether these genetic effects match               
              those predicted by long-term demographic data.  Besides its                    
              theoretical applications, this study will further the protection               
              of biodiversity by showing how habitat loss and fragmentation                  
              affect the genetic makeup of ecologically specialized species.
