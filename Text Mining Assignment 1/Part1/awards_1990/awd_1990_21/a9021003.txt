Abstract    :
              The research, in the general area of Analytical and Surface                    
              Chemistry, focuses on a range of nuclear magnetic resonance                    
              (NMR) techniques applied to the study of the surfaces of silica                
              and related materials.  The study promises to enhance our                      
              understanding of these important materials, the basic                          
              components of soils and rocks.                                                 
                                                                                             
              Silca surfaces will be directly examined by 1H, 29Si and 17O                   
              NMR techniques, and indirectly examined by chemically modifying                
              the surface and then using NMR.  By varying the size of the                    
              chemically modifying molecules surface topography, and                         
              distincitions between internal pore or channel surfaces and the                
              external surfaces will be investigated.    The                                 
              chromatographically important C18-silica system will be studied                
              by a combination of deuterium line-shape experiments,                          
              relaxation experiments and other methods.
