Abstract    :
                   The state-of-the-art in the boring bar industry is to use                 
              carbide bars to achieve a high degree of stiffness. But many                   
              machining jobs call for a small diameter hole of great length.                 
              Current boring bars are limited by this length-to-diameter ratio               
              with ratios of 10 to 1 or greater resulting in intolerable chatter.            
              Attempts have been made by manufacturers to insert passive damping             
              devices into a cavity near the workpiece of the bar to increase                
              this length-to-diameter ratio. Although this measure has met with              
              limited success, the improvement is sufficiently encouraging to try            
              other damping methods.                                                         
              %%%                                                                            
                   The purpose of this research project is to investigate the                
              problem of controlling chatter on a boring bar.
