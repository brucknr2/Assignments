Abstract    :
              This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                
              award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to                    
              Grinnell College for the repair and renovation of the wing of                  
              Bowen Hall of Science which houses the research and research                   
              training activities of the Chemistry Department.  This wing was                
              constructed in 1952 and has not been renovated since that time.                
              The ARFMP grant of $250,000 and $305,238 provided by the grantee               
              as cost sharing will be used to modernize these research and                   
              research training facilities.  This project will address the need              
              to improve the current research infrastructure by (a) redesigning              
              the research laboratories to make more efficient use of space,                 
              substantially increasing both hood and bench space; (b) providing              
              the stockroom with adequate ventilation and flammable solvent                  
              storage; and (c) redesigning the instrument room to more optimally             
              house modern electronic instrumentation.                                       
                                                                                             
              This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                     
              providing an improved environment for the conduct of research and              
              for the training of quality undergraduate students in a department             
              in which the faculty and their students publish their work                     
              regularly in top journals and which has produced a large number of             
              chemists over the years.
