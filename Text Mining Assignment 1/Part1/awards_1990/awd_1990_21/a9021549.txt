Abstract    :
              An exploratory study on novel ways of modeling and studying the                
              dynamics of variable mass systems will be conducted.  An attempt               
              will be made to find a mathematically sound and efficient                      
              methodology for characterizing such systems, and novel methods of              
              dynamical equation derivation that avoid unacceptably drastic                  
              simplo=ifying assumptions.  Finally, a cursory look will be taken              
              at the effects of structural flexibility of the solid phase on the             
              dynamics of the whole system.
