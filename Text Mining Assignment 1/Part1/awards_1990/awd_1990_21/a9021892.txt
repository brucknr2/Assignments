Abstract    :
              This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                
              award from the Research Facilities Office to Ball State University             
              provides funds for the repair and renovation of the Cooper Physical            
              Building which houses that institution's research and research                 
              training activities in chemistry.  This building was constructed in            
              1965 and last renovated in 1978.  The ARFMP grant of $120,000 and              
              $142,879 provided by the grantee as cost sharing will be used to               
              modernize these research and research training facilities of the               
              Department of Chemistry.  This project will address the need to                
              improve the current research infrastructure both in terms of health            
              and safety and of the quality of research that can be conducted by             
              providing larger, more efficient fume hoods and an upgraded                    
              ventilation system.                                                            
                                                                                             
              This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                     
              providing an improved environment for the conduct of chemical                  
              synthesis research and for the training of quality undergraduate               
              students in a department with a particular commitment to                       
              increasing the number of minority and nontraditional majors                    
              graduated.
