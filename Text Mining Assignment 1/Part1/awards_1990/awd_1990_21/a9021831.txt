Abstract    :
              This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                
              award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to                    
              Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute for the renovation and repair of              
              Cogswell Laboratory which houses the research and research                     
              training activities of the Department of Chemistry.  This building             
              was constructed in 1970 and has not been renovated since that time.            
              The ARFMP grant of $600,000 and $4,900,000 provided by the grantee             
              as cost sharing will be used to modernize these research and                   
              research training facilities.  This project will address the need              
              to improve the current research infrastructure by upgrading the                
              air-handling system and increasing the hood capacity.  An increase             
              in the size, productivity, and quality of the research program and             
              compliance with modern health and safety standards are changes                 
              expected to accrue from this renovation.                                       
              This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                     
              providing an improved environment for the conduct of research and              
              for the training of quality undergraduate and graduate students.               
              Renssalaer Polytechnic Institute has a Chemistry Department which              
              has strength in fundamental research and yet at the same time is               
              also highly  applications-conscious.  Thus the students trained in             
              these laboratories are in demand in both basic and applied                     
              research fields.
