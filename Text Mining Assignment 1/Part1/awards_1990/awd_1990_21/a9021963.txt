Abstract    :
                   The Cascade Topology Seminar is a series of two-day meetings              
              held each year since 1987.  Thirty to fifty participants meet at an            
              institution in the region.  There are usually two or three lectures            
              on Saturday and one or two lectures on Sunday, plus much informal              
              discussion, on a weekend in the spring and another in the fall.                
              The organizers have attracted excellent speakers, and the seminars             
              have played a significant role in fostering topological research in            
              this region of the country.  This modest award will assist the                 
              organizers, mainly to bring in high quality speakers from outside              
              the Pacific Northwest, during the next three years.
