Abstract    :
              This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                
              award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to the                
              State University of New York College at Buffalo for the repair                 
              and renovation of the Great Lakes Field Station which houses that              
              institution's biological, chemical, and technological research                 
              and research training activities that comprise aquatic science.                
              This building was constructed in 1952 and last renovated in 1981.              
              The ARFMP grant of $350,000 and $350,000 provided by the grantee               
              as cost sharing will be used to modernize these research and                   
              research training facilities, thus allowing a significant                      
              increase in the number of faculty and students that can be                     
              accommodated in Great Lakes.focused research efforts as well as                
              in the number of academic and industrial investigations which                  
              concern the effect of effluents on the lakes system that can be                
              conducted.  The project will address the need to improve the                   
              current research infrastructure by upgrading the system capable                
              of supplying untreated Lake Erie water, repairing lake access                  
              structures, replacing deteriorated lake/river specimen and fish                
              holding tanks and raceways, providing larger and more modern wet               
              laboratory facilities, repairing external holding ponds, and                   
              enhancing chemical safety and personal security systems.                       
                                                                                             
              This award contributes to the infrastructure of science and                    
              engineering by providing an improved environment for the conduct               
              of research and for the training of quality undergraduate and                  
              graduate students.  The program focus on the zebra mussel                      
              invasion means that the students trained in these laboratories                 
              will not only have expertise in basic research, but they will                  
              also be prepared to address a very important regional problem of               
              applied research.
