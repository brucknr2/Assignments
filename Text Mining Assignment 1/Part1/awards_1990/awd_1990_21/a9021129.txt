Abstract    :
              The general objectives of this project are as follows:                          
                                                                                            
              (1)    To identify various systematic and random errors and/or                 
              error                                                                          
                     levels in the different experiments from which virial                   
                     coefficients are currently extracted.  There experiments                
                     include measurements of P-V-T and sonic velocity.                       
                                                                                             
              (2)    To find how these errors propagate into the virial                      
                     coefficients using computer simulation of the original                  
                     experiment.                                                             
                                                                                             
              (3)    To reduce the errors in each experiment by existing                     
              apparatus            and constructing new ones, particularly for the           
              technique            shown to have the least inherent error                    
              following propagation.                                                         
                                                                                             
              (4)    To end the present sonic/P-v-T controversy, which has                   
              cast a        shadow over literature virial coefficients, both by              
              computer      simulations and new experimental measurements.                   
                                                                                             
              (5)    To provide correlators/compilers with quantitative                      
              procedures           for classification of the accuracy of published           
              virial        coefficients.
