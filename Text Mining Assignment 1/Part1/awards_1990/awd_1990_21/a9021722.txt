Abstract    :
              This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                
              award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to Oregon             
              State University for the renovation and repair of Burt Hall which              
              houses that institution's oceanographic research and research                  
              training activities.  This building was constructed in 1965 and has            
              not been renovated since that time.  The ARFMP grant of $125,000               
              and $125,000 provided by the grantee as cost sharing will be used              
              to modernize these research and research training facilities.  This            
              project will address the need to improve the current research                  
              infrastructure both in terms of health and safety and of the                   
              quality and quantity of the research and research training that can            
              be conducted by replacing fume hoods, substandard sinks, and                   
              laboratory benches, and correcting heating and ventilation                     
              problems.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                     
              providing an improved environment for the conduct of                           
              biological/chemical oceanographic research and for the training of             
              quality undergraduate and graduate students under conditions freed             
              from the serious extant environmental hazards.
