Abstract    :
                   This research will examine the physiological and genetic                  
              basis of disease resistance and plant fitness in wild and                      
              agricultural populations of the mustard Brassica campestris.                   
              Variation in plant chemistry and enzymes that are believed to                  
              control resistance to insects and microbial pathogens, will be                 
              related to theories about plant protection.  Integrating                       
              molecular information from the DNA level with biochemistry and                 
              quantitative analysis of disease resistance, will lead to a                    
              better understanding of the process of plant growth and plant                  
              defense.  In addition to the fundamental scientific understanding              
              deriving from this work, there are potential agricultural and                  
              environmental benefits.  This work may lead to genetically                     
              improved crops (canola, broccoli, etc.) that are more resistant                
              to insects or diseases and require reduced application of toxic                
              chemical pesticides.
