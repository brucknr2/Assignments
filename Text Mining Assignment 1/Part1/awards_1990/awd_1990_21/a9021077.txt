                   The Microelectonics Center of North Carolina (MCNC) comprises             
              three centers: the Center for Communications, the Center for                   
              Microelectronics, and the North Carolina Supercomputing Center.                
              The MCNC Center for Communications will render program planning and            
              logistical services in coordinating an Orientation and Training

              Undergraduate Institutions that have recently obtained a connection            
              to the NSFNET.                                                                 
                   The Workshop will allow computer networking experts and users             
              to present instruction on internet technology, major protocols, and            
              applications with hands-on experiences provided to                             
              educators/researchers and technical specialists of minority                    
              institutions that can readily benefit from the NSFNET connection.
