                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              This project will produce a comparative grammar of the Sahaptian               
              languages.  It will cover sound changes, comparative phonology,                
              morphology, syntax, and discourse.  A Sahaptian morpheme                       
              dictionary will be included, listing all proposed Nez Perce and                
              Sahaptin derivatives (with every suggestion from the literature                
              duly noted).  This contribution, in addition to previous                       
              descriptive work on Nez Perce and Sahaptin, will make Sahaptian                
              one of the best understood American Indian language families.  It              
              will provide data for further comparison within Penutian, as well              
              as make a contribution with theoretical appeal in the area of                  
              general historical and comparative linguistics.
