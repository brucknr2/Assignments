Abstract    :
              This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                
              award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to                    
              Allegheny College for the repair and renovation of Carnegie Hall               
              which houses the Department of Psychology's behavioral science                 
              research and research activities.  This building was constructed               
              in 1915 and last renovated in 1960.  The ARFMP grant of $200,000               
              and $216,667 provided by the grantee as cost sharing will be used              
              to modernize these research and research training facilities. This             
              project will address the need to improve the current research                  
              infrastructure by redesigning and equipping the existing research              
              space in keeping with changes in the study and practice of                     
              psychology in the last 30 years.  The crowded, outmoded facility               
              will be converted into a more efficient high quality space for                 
              research which will foster better focus, more continuity, and                  
              needed privacy in the conduct of student projects, and it will also            
              enable the conduct of a greater range of research activities than              
              is currently feasible.                                                         
                                                                                             
              This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                     
              providing an improved environment for the conduct of research and              
              for the training of quality undergraduate students in a research-              
              based curriculum in which they are actively engaged in hands-on                
              experimentation and research from an early point in time in their              
              academic careers.  Allegheny College has a good record of students             
              majoring in science and continuing in science-related fields, and              
              the renovation of these facilities will help the College maintain              
              that record.
