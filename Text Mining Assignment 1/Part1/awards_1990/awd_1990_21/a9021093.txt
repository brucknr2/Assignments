Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic                  
              Program supports a project to synthesize and characterize new                  
              transition metal complexes containing cyclic trialkyne                         
              (cyclotriyne) ligands.  The work will be carried out in the                    
              Chemistry Department of the University of Akron by Dr. Wiley J.                
              Youngs and Dr. Claire A. Tessier.  Previous work by these                      
              investigators has demonstrated the feasibility of preparing                    
              these compounds and semiconducting properties have been noted                  
              in some cases.  Production of thermally stable conducting and                  
              semiconducting materials is a potential outcome of the expanded                
              research project planned.                                                      
                                                                                             
              First, cyclotriyne derivatives which can "tune" the electronic                 
              properties of the metal-ligand complexes or permit binding of                  
              larger metals in the ligand cavity will be prepared.  It is                    
              anticipated that metals will bind to these ligands in a variety                
              of modes.  The structural and electronic properties of the                     
              compounds will be determined and their interaction with small                  
              molecules investigated.
