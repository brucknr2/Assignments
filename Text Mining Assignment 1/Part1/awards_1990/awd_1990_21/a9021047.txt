Abstract    :
                   Computers have become indispensable in the design, simulation,            
              optimization, control, and scheduling of chemical processes. Yet,              
              the conceptual representations and computational models needed to              
              more fully automate the higher-level thought processes of the                  
              managers, operating engineers, and operators of large process                  
              management and control systems have yet to be found.                           
              %%%                                                                            
                   The proposed research is about creating the necessary                     
              conceptual representations and implementing them as computational              
              models in order to manage the information flow of an autonomous                
              process control system.
