Abstract    :
              This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                
              award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to the                
              Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History for the replacement               
              of the Museum's Biochemical Systematics Laboratory which houses                
              research and research training activities in the biological and                
              earth sciences on the evolution of organisms.  The Biochemical                 
              Systematics Laboratory was constructed in 1975 and last renovated              
              in 1985.  The need for its replacement by an expanded facility is              
              well justified and cost-effective.  The replacement facility is                
              designed for research and research training in the area of                     
              biochemical and molecular systematics.  The ARFMP grant of                     
              $103,992 and $360,258 provided by the grantee as cost sharing                  
              will be used to modernize these research and research training                 
              facilities.  The replacement facility will permit the utilization              
              of the Museum's extensive molecular data bank that is of                       
              importance to the conduct of cutting-edge research in the area of              
              biochemical and molecular systematics.                                         
                                                                                             
              This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                     
              providing an improved environment for research and for the                     
              training of quality graduate students.  Los Angeles County Museum              
              of Natural History curators are collaborating with several                     
              universities in southern California to provide training in the                 
              area of systematics where shortages in professionals are                       
              anticipated.
