Abstract    :
              This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                
              award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to the                
              University of Missouri - Columbia for the repair and renovation of             
              Schlundt Annex so that it can house the research and research                  
              training programs in protein structure of the Biochemistry                     
              Department.  This building was constructed in 1940 and has not                 
              previously been renovated.  The ARFMP grant of $1,449,728 and                  
              $1,534,760 provided by the grantee as cost sharing will be used to             
              modernize these research and research training facilities and                  
              permit a strong and coherent research group to be unified along                
              with a transgenic plant facility in a contiguous research space.               
              This project will address the need to improve the current research             
              infrastructure by reconfiguring the space so that it is more                   
              functional, installing centralized air conditioning and heating and            
              the appropriate duct work, increasing electrical services,                     
              improving the access to all floors, upgrading the transgenic plant             
              facilities, and constructing laboratories to house the protein                 
              sequencing and peptide synthesis facility.                                     
                                                                                             
              This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                     
              providing an improved environment for the conduct of research and              
              for the training of quality undergraduate and graduate students                
              and postdoctoral fellows.  Students trained in these laboratories,             
              where there is a coherent grouping of strong faculty leadership                
              surrounded by a configuration of pertinent facilities, will be able            
              to keep abreast of the latest developments in an important area of             
              biochemistry.
