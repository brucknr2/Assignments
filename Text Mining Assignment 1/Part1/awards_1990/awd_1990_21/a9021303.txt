Abstract    :
              Research is proposed to calculate the statistics of the                        
              coherent lidar power for a real monostatic lidar                               
              system, including the effects of refractive turbulence                         
              and detector geometry.  Analytic expressions for the                           
              average coherent lidar power for an idealized lidar                            
              system operating in the atmospheric boundary layer                             
              will be calculated to determine system performance.                            
              Various detector geometries will be considered to                              
              investigate the performance of detector arrays and to                          
              test the hypothesis that beam alignment methods                                
              based on the effects of refractive turbulence are                              
              superior to present methods.  The alignment                                    
              constraints for a monostatic system with refractive                            
              turbulence will be determined using analytic                                   
              techniques for idealized systems and numerical                                 
              simulations for real systems.  The simulations will                            
              also produce an accurate statistical description of real                       
              laser radar signal fluctuations.  The different physical                       
              mechanisms of laser radar performance will be                                  
              investigated and the regime where simple analytic                              
              results are valid will be determined.  The calculations                        
              will emphasize the shorter wavelengths of solid state                          
              lidar systems. This research will help design the next                         
              generation of solid state lidars for remote sensing of                         
              the atmosphere.
