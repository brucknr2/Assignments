Abstract    :
              Professor Coppens is supported by a grant from the Experimental                
              Physical Chemistry Program to use synchrotron radiation to                     
              determine the locations of atoms in solids which are                           
              superconductors and organic substances which are conductors.                   
              These studies will help us understand why some materials behave                
              as superconductors at high temperatures and why the organic                    
              materials are superconductors at very low temperatures.                        
                                                                                             
              The project involves the use of synchrotron radiation to study                 
              the following: Anomalous scattering of X-rays is used to                       
              selectively identify site occupancy, and in combination with                   
              high-accuracy charge density techniques, to site-selectively                   
              determine the oxidation states of atoms in solids.  The                        
              response of organic and inorganic crystals to an external                      
              electric field is measured and analysed in terms of the                        
              piezoelectric effect and molecular and ionic displacements.                    
              Very low temperature single crystal techniques are used in the                 
              analysis of charge densities in crystals, and in the                           
              investigation of the dependence of the structure of                            
              low-dimensional conducting solids on temperature.
