Abstract    :
              This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                
              award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to Emory              
              University for the renovation and repair of the Psychology                     
              Building which will as a result be able to house that                          
              institution's research and research training activities in                     
              cognitive psychology, developmental psychology, and psychobiology.             
              This building was constructed in 1951 and has not been renovated               
              since that time.  The ARFMP grant of $700,000 and $857,595 provided            
              by the grantee as cost sharing will be used to modernize these                 
              research and research training facilities and contribute to the                
              consolidation of the entire psychology faculty in one building for             
              the first time.  This project will address the need to improve the             
              current research infrastructure both in terms of health and safety             
              and of the quantity and quality of research that can be carried out            
              by upgrading the plumbing, heating, ventilation, and air                       
              conditioning (HVAC), and lighting; and by reconfiguring the                    
              partitioning of space including the provision of rooms with                    
              acoustical insulation and other features that make them suitable               
              for modern research in psychology.                                             
                                                                                             
              This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                     
              providing an improved environment for the conduct of research and              
              for the training of quality undergraduate and graduate students by             
              a distinguished, nationally recognized faculty.  Students trained              
              in these laboratories will be able to maintain high standards in               
              the conduct of psychological research.
