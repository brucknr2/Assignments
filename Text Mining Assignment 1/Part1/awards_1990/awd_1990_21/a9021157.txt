Abstract    :
              With support from the Organic Dynamics Program, Dr. Beak will                  
              utilize the "endocyclic restriction test" to investigate                       
              allowed geometries for reactions that occur at atoms which lack                
              stereochemical features. In this approach, transfer of                         
              non-stereogenic heteroatoms is performed in systems wherein the                
              bond forming group and the leaving group are joined by a chain.                
              The size of the endocyclic ring required for intramolecular                    
              transfer limits the available reaction geometry. When taken in                 
              combination with other mechanistic tools, application of this                  
              approach should provide important, detailed information                        
              regarding the geometry of the transition states in                             
              atom-transfer reactions.                                                       
                                                                                             
              The geometries of reactions at oxygen, nitrogen, halogen,                      
              sulfur, and hydrogen will be investigated. Mechanisms involving                
              concerted, associative and/or dissociative steps are to be                     
              evaluated for each case. Other mechanistic probes, e.g.,                       
              crossover experiments, kinetic studies, and determinations of                  
              intra- and intermolecular isotope effects, will be used to                     
              supplement results obtained via application of the endocyclic                  
              restriction test.
