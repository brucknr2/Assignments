Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Myelin, a substance formed by Schwann cells in the nervous                     
              system, provides an insulating barrier around nerve fibers.                    
              During neuronal maturation, myelin is formed by the compaction of              
              membrane sheets and requires the precise organization of a number              
              of specific proteins.  The long-term goals of this research are                
              to understand how membranes of myelin are held together at the                 
              molecular level.  The immediate goal is to investigate the Po                  
              protein, a major constituent of myelin that has an essential role              
              in the maintenance of myelin shealth compactness.  The Po protein              
              contains adhesion domains that allow Po molecules to attach to                 
              each other.  Dr. Filbin will characterize the Po-Po interaction                
              by determining what manipulations of the Po molecule affect                    
              increase adhesion in transfected Chinese Hamster Ovary cells                   
              expressing Po protein.  Experiments using Po-peptides and Po                   
              antibodies will be performed to determine the amino acid                       
              sequences essential for adhesion.  Results from this study will                
              help elucidate how Po functions in myelin.
