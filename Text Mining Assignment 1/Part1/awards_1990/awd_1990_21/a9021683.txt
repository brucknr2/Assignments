Abstract    :
              The proposed investigation will utilize a recently developed                   
              analytical technique (homogenization theory) to design composite               
              microstructure for specific loading histories, such as compression,            
              torsion and multi-axis loading histories.  These analytical                    
              techniques are novel and allow determining both the microstructural            
              and macroscopic response of fiber-reinforced ceramics to multiaxial            
              loading histories.  The approach allows the analysis of complex                
              composite systems, including those with 3-D fiber architectures.               
              Moreover, the approach can be used to determine the microstructural            
              and macroscopic response of composites at elevated temperatures,               
              where non-linear behavior may be present.  The philosophy of the               
              proposed work is to identify specific microstructure (including                
              requirements for interfacial bonding) that will optimize the                   
              fracture resistance of fiver-reinforced composites for various                 
              static and cyclic loading histories.  The development of fiber-                
              reinforced ceramics is still at a very early state; thus, the                  
              proposed investigation has the potential to significantly reduce               
              the development time for these composites.
