Abstract    :
                   This project involves the provision of conference expenses                
              (including travel, subsistence, and other necessary expenses) for              
              selected computer professionals who are physically disabled, a                 
              member of a racial or ethic minority, or both.  The expenses are               
              for attendees at the conference on Computers and Quality of Life               
              (CQL'90) on September 13-16, 1990 in Washington, D.C..  The                    
              conferences is sponsored by the acm/SIGCAS (Association for                    
              Computing Machinery's Special Interest Group on Computers and                  
              Society) and the acm/SIGCAPH (Special Interest  Group on                       
              Computers and the Physically Handicapped).  This conference                    
              offers a multi-disciplinary dialog on what is known about the                  
              effects, both positive and negative, of computing on human well-               
              being.  The program features computing applications that benefit               
              the entire society or groups with special needs, e.g.,                         
              disabilities.  Project support will make possible for computer                 
              professionals, including instructors, to contribute to a dialog                
              in which they would be able to participate without special                     
              support.***  //
