Abstract    :
              This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                
              award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to the                
              University of the Pacific-Stockton for the renovation and repair               
              of the Pacific Science Center which houses that institution's                  
              research and research activities in biochemistry, bioinorganic                 
              chemistry and bioanalytical chemistry.  This building was                      
              constructed prior to 1940 and last renovated when the University               
              of the Pacific purchased the building in 1974.  The ARFMP grant of             
              $212,000 and $212,000 provided by the grantee as cost sharing will             
              be used to modernize these research and research training                      
              facilities.  This project will address the need to improve the                 
              current research infrastructure by reconfiguring the laboratory                
              space to include four more efficient laboratories, a computer-                 
              instrumentation room, a cold room, and a darkroom and storage                  
              areas, and by upgrading the electrical and heating, ventilation,               
              and air conditioning (HVAC) systems.                                           
                                                                                             
              This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                     
              providing an improved environment for the conduct of research and              
              for the training of quality undergraduate and graduate students                
              for careers in chemistry and biochemistry.  Pre-college students,              
              so essential to the issue of the human resources pipeline in these             
              fields, have also enjoyed strong involvement in scientific                     
              research projects at the University of the Pacific.  University                
              students trained in these laboratories have consistently found                 
              positions in top tier universities and have pursued research                   
              careers.  This project will make it possible for the University of             
              the Pacific's research program to further expand so that it will be            
              able to make even larger contributions to the human resources                  
              pipeline.
