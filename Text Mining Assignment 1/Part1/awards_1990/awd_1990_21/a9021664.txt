Abstract    :
                   The field of topology became an independent mathematical                  
              discipline around the turn of the century.  Since then, it has                 
              grown into a large and diversified area of mathematical activity.              
              Methods from the different subareas of topology have widely                    
              influenced current research in many other areas, from mathematical             
              physics to algebra and number theory.  The conference supported by             
              this grant will focus on the use of topology in three main areas of            
              current research:  Global geometry, topology and mathematical                  
              physics (including gauge field theory, topological and conformal               
              quantum field theories, and the global geometry of the Dirac                   
              operator); Algebraic geometry and algebraic K-theory; and Dynamical            
              systems.                                                                       
                   The conference, entitled Topological Methods in Modern                    
              Mathematics, will be held at SUNY Stony Brook, June 14-21, 1991.               
              In each of the three areas there will be broad survey talks                    
              together with more detailed lectures on the most important and                 
              exciting recent developments.  The conference will provide an                  
              opportunity for mathematicians from three distinct mathematical                
              disciplines whose common feature is the use of topological methods             
              and results to come together and interact in an extremely fruitful             
              way.  In addition, special tutorial programs are planned for                   
              graduate and undergraduate students, so that they may also                     
              participate in the conference and gain a sense of the reality and              
              excitement of research mathematicians.
