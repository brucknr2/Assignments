Abstract    :
                   A broad program of research in theoretical physics will                   
              include work on superstring theory, including non-perturbative                 
              approaches, studies of two and higher-dimensional quantum                      
              gravity, numerical investigations of quantum chromodynamics, and               
              study of the physics that can produce large-scale structure in                 
              the universe.  Superstring theory is the exciting candidate for a              
              theory of all the fundamental forces, including gravity, and                   
              quantum chromodynamics is the increasingly-confirmed detailed                  
              theory of the strong nuclear force, so the investigations to be                
              undertaken are very important.
