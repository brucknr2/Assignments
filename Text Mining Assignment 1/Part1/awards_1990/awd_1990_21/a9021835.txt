Abstract    :
              This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                
              award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to The                
              Pennsylvania State University-University Park Campus for the                   
              renovation and repair of Fenske Laboratory which houses that                   
              institution's chemical engineering research and research training              
              activities, including tribology research, materials science of                 
              surfactants, environmental processes, and catalysis. This building             
              was constructed in 1958 and was expanded by the addition of a new              
              wing in 1968, but it has not been renovated since that time.  The              
              ARFMP grant of $825,000 and $1,133,226 provided by the grantee as              
              cost sharing will be used to modernize these research and research             
              training facilities.  This project will address the need to improve            
              the current research infrastructure by upgrading heating and air-              
              conditioning to ensure proper conditions for computers and                     
              sensitive instruments; installing proper ventilation, lighting, and            
              electrical circuits to meet health and safety standards; providing             
              handicapped access; installing the wiring necessary for a computer             
              network; and refurbishing  laboratory space.                                   
                                                                                             
              This award contributes to the infrastructure of science and                    
              engineering by providing an improved environment for one of the                
              nation's premier research programs, the Tribology Research                     
              Program, as well as for other fields of The Pennsylvania State                 
              University's Department of Chemical Engineering.  Students trained             
              in these laboratories, where high technology instruments are used              
              and where numerous functional fluids and lubricants have been                  
              developed, are in demand in both basic and applied research                    
              fields.
