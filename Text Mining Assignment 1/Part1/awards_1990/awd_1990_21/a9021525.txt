Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              To eliminate the underrepresentation of Black, Hispanics, and                  
              Native Americans in mathematics and related fields at the                      
              collegiate, graduate, and professional research level across                   
              the nation, we propose to establish a broad consortium of                      
              more than 200 colleges and universities-each working locally                   
              to achieve this  goal.  In addition, we will establish more                    
              than five residential research  summer institutes that will                    
              prepare talented minority undergraduates for graduate study                    
              in mathematics and, ultimately, for academic and                               
              professional  careers.  Approximately 10,000 minority                          
              undergraduates will be involved in consortium programs at the                  
              end of five years.  One thousand of these will be enrolled in                  
              programs explicitly designed to attract them to advanced                       
              studies in mathematics.  Professional organizations, in                        
              particular the Mathematical Association of American, will be                   
              intimately involved with this project to ensure that the                       
              advancement of Blacks, Hispanics, and Native Americans in                      
              mathematics is established as a legitimate and central                         
              responsibility of mathematicians and mathematics departments.
