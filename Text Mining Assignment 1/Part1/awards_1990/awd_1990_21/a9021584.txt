Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The project will emphasize the recruitment, retention,                         
              graduation and graduate school placement of Blacks,                            
              Hispanics, and Native Americans who are enrolled in                            
              selected undergraduate degree programs at four (4) member                      
              institution.  The disciplines from which students are                          
              eligible to participate are biology, chemistry, mathematics,                   
              physics and all engineering specialties.                                       
                                                                                             
                                               PROJECT GOALS                                 
                                                                                             
              The overall goal of the FGAMPSE is to significantly increase                   
              the number of targeted minorities who obtain undergraduate                     
              and graduate degrees in the sciences and engineering by:                       
                                                                                             
              1.)  recruiting and graduating these students from the AMP                     
                   disciplines of their choice in four (4) years;                            
                                                                                             
              2.)  establishing working relationships with a large number                    
                   of graduate institutions for the purpose of facilitating                  
                   the placement of project graduates;                                       
                                                                                             
              3.)  enhancing graduate school placement opportunities for                     
                   project graduates through the provision of greater and                    
                   better research experiences;                                              
                                                                                             
              4.)  initiating and strengthening working relationships among                  
                   students and between students and faculty with the aim                    
                   to improve students' academic performance;                                
                                                                                             
              5.)  reducing high attrition in the freshman and sophomore                     
                   years by providing  these students with summer                            
                   refresher courses that review and preview important                       
                   math and science concepts; and                                            
                                                                                             
              6.)  bringing together on member campuses significant numbers                  
                   of highly motivated minority students who, by their                       
                   organized and serious approach to their work, will                        
                   serve as positive role models for other minority                          
                   students.
