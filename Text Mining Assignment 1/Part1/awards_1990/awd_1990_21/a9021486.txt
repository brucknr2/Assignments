Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Pulling on objects in the world (e.g., opening a door) is a               
              common activity of daily living that requires people to use their              
              arms effectively, often while maintaining a standing posture.                  
              Such actions, which are readily performed by adults are                        
              deceptively simple.  Pulls made while standing actually require a              
              complex and precise coordination of many muscles and body segment              
              motions for the person to achieve the focal goal of pulling, and               
              still maintain balance.  Research has shown that postural                      
              adjustments (body motions and muscle activity) accompany pulling               
              movements made by free-standing individuals.  However, neither                 
              the precise function of these postural movements nor the neural                
              processes by which they are coordinated with arm movements are                 
              very well understood.  This research program will shed light on                
              how postural adjustments are coordinated with arm movements.  The              
              studies will systematically vary the amount of physical support                
              and expectancy factors.  The effect of these factors on body                   
              motion and balance, on pulling forces, and on muscle activity in               
              the arms and legs will yield new insights into the functional and              
              neural processes which coordinate postural adjustments with                    
              voluntary pulling movements.  This resezrch will contribute                    
              significantly to fundamental knowledge about the control of                    
              posture and movement.
