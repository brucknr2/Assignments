Abstract    :
              This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                
              award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to Miami              
              University at Oxford for the renovation and repair of Culler Hall              
              which houses the atomic-molecular-optical and the condensed                    
              matter-magnetics research and research training activities of the              
              Physics Department.  This building was constructed in 1960 and has             
              not been renovated since that time.  The ARFMP grant of $725,000               
              and $964,471 provided by the grantee as cost sharing will be used              
              to modernize these research and research training facilities.  This            
              project will address the need to improve the current research                  
              infrastructure in terms of health and safety as well as of the                 
              quality and quantity of research that can be conducted by providing            
              adequate power, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC),             
              and lighting and by reconfiguring the space for more efficient use.            
              The renovation will at the same time create a flexible research                
              facility with a subdivision of space easily adaptable to changing              
              conditions and research interests.                                             
                                                                                             
              This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                     
              providing an improved environment for the conduct of research and              
              for the training of quality undergraduate and master's degree                  
              students in a Physics department with a strong commitment to                   
              student involvement in research training activities.  This                     
              renovation will increase the number of students who can be                     
              accommodated in a program which has won awards for its quality.
