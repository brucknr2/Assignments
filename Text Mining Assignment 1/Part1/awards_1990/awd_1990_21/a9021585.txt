Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              South Dakota State University is establishing a connection to                  
              NSFNET via a 56,000 bits per second line through the MIDNET                    
              mid-level network.  The connection enhances collaborations of                  
              campus scientists with colleagues at other institutions, and allows            
              access to libraries and other remote facilities throughout the                 
              internet.  This award funds part of the costs for two years.***//
