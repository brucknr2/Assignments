Abstract    :
                   A theoretical investigation of the propagation of ultra-                  
              intense radiation in plasmas will be performed and calculations                
              relating to the phenomena of propagation will be made using                    
              existing or modified computer programs.  These calculations will               
              continue the work already started as a result of the                           
              collaboration between C. K. Rhodes and K. Boyer of the University              
              of Illinois at Chicago, A. B. Borisov of Moscow State University               
              and A. V. Borovskiy, V. V. Korobkin and A. M. Prokhorov of the                 
              USSR Academy of Science.
