Abstract    :
                   The Santa Fe Institute (SFI), a non-profit research and                   
              graduate teaching organization, proposes to continue its programs              
              of interdisciplinary research and education on the principles                  
              that determine the dynamic behavior of complex systems.  The                   
              Institute is founded on the premise that there are common                      
              principles that determine the behavior of various complex                      
              systems, especially systems that are sufficiently complex to                   
              learn and adapt.  Our approach is to understand these principles               
              by studying specific systems in the context of more general                    
              themes.  Since 1987 it has operated a center in Santa Fe where                 
              leading scholars in the physical, computational, life, and social              
              sciences come together.                                                        
                   The project includes:  a) A program on the basic physics,                 
              mathematics, information sciences, and computational aspects of                
              complexity including work on the shared properties of complex                  
              systems, and innovative computer modeling.  b) A residential                   
              research program on adaptive computation employing the techniques              
              of general algorithms and classifier systems and including work                
              on developing computational and visualization tools.  c)  A                    
              residential research program on economics as a complex, adaptive               
              system.  d)  A program on life sciences, that includes modeling                
              of the immune system, generic data analysis, and models of                     
              protein folding.  e) A Summer School on the Sciences of                        
              Complexity in Santa Fe, managed by SFI in collaboration with a                 
              number of other institutions.
