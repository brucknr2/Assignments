Abstract    :
              This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                
              award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to the                
              University of Tennessee at Knoxville for the repair and renovation             
              of Middle Dabney Hall which houses a major proportion of the                   
              research and research training activities of that institution's                
              Chemistry Department.  This building was constructed in 1954 and               
              has not been renovated since that time.  The ARFMP grant of                    
              $1,700,000 and $4,910,000 provided by the grantee as cost sharing              
              will be used to modernize these research and research training                 
              facilities.  This project will address the need to improve the                 
              current research infrastructure both in terms of increasing its                
              safety and of increasing the quantity and quality of research that             
              can be conducted by upgrading the heating, ventilation, and air                
              conditioning (HVAC) system and by installing fume hoods, solvent               
              cabinets, and casework.                                                        
                                                                                             
              This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                     
              providing an improved environment for the conduct of research and              
              for the training of undergraduates from other institutions through             
              the Science Alliance and National Science Foundation summer                    
              research programs as well as for the training of the University of             
              Tennessee's own undergraduate and graduate students.
