Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              This proposal seeks support from the National Science                          
              Foundation to develop a strategic plan for implementing a                      
              successful Metropolitan Washington Alliance for Increasing                     
              Minority Graduates in Science and Engineering.  The                            
              specific goal of the Alliance is to increase the annual                        
              number of African-American and Hispanic S&E baccalaureate                      
              graduates in the area to 2,000 by the year 2000.  It is                        
              estimated that in 1989, some 400 African-American and                          
              Hispanic students earned baccalaureate degrees in science                      
              and engineering in the metropolitan Washington area.  We                       
              have established a goal that will increase that number by                      
              a magnitude of five in the year 2000.  This can only be                        
              accomplished by developing a systematic approach to S&E                        
              education focusing on precollege and undergraduate                             
              enrichment, academic and support services.  The                                
              jurisdictions served by this proposal include the                              
              Washington Metropolitan area represented by counties and                       
              cities in suburban Maryland, Northern Virginia and the                         
              District of Columbia, a 2,300 square mile are with                             
              approximately 2.7 million people.                                              
                                                                                             
              The Washington, D.C. metropolitan region is especially                         
              will-suited for the establishment of a successful                              
              Alliance.  It is one of the leading scientific research                        
              and development centers in the nation; the center of the                       
              Federal scientific effort; the site of many Government                         
              laboratories; a focal point for industrial research and                        
              development (with business showing great interest in S&E                       
              activities in the region); a major center of African-                          
              American and Asian-American life); the location of a                           
              number of comprehensive universities; and an area with                         
              more than 50,000 African-American and Hispanic youth                           
              between the ages of 16 and 18, who, with adequate support,                     
              have the potential to become 2,000 S&E baccalaureate                           
              graduates.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              Howard University is especially well-suited to assume the                      
              leadership role in this Alliance because the University is                     
              a comprehensive university of national significance, with                      
              graduate programs in a number of fields of natural science                     
              and mathematics, as well as in engineering, medicine, and                      
              dentistry.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              With its national Advisory Committee, chaired by                               
              Congressman Mervyn Dymally, the University's Institute for                     
              Science, Space and Technology has already begun to lay the                     
              groundwork for the development of an Alliance in the                           
              metropolitan Washington region.  On June 27, 1990, a                           
              meeting was held with Howard University officials and                          
              representatives of the Consortium of Colleges and                              
              Universities, D.C. Public Schools, Montgomery County                           
              Public Schools, Federal R&D agencies, businesses and other                     
              private organizations to review opportunities and expand                       
              the development of this proposal.
