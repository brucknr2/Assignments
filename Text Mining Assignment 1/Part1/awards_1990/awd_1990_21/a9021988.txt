Abstract    :
                The University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC) has made                  
              a conscious decision to be a major producer of minority                        
              scientists, mathematician, and engineers.  It's successful                     
              Meyerhoff Scholarship Program, initiated in 1988, is designed                  
              to facilitate the recruitment of minority scholars into these                  
              fields.                                                                        
                NSF support is requested to expand and enhance current                       
              efforts.  Five groups of twenty- five outstanding                              
              African-American scholars would be financially and                             
              academically supported, through the bachelors degree, with the                 
              understanding that they will continue on to a graduate or                      
              professional degree.  Each student will receive strong                         
              academic enrichment and support beginning with a summer                        
              bridge program prior entrance into the University.  A UMBC                     
              faculty member will work with the student on a significant                     
              research project and they will be assigned a practicing                        
              scientist or engineering professional as a mentor.                             
                UMBC has received individual and corporate support for this                  
                                                                                             
              program and is committed to continuing its efforts.  These                     
              students will form a cadre of talented professionals who will                  
              move into leadership roles in their chosen fields.  They will                  
              also provide an additional group of mentor/role models to                      
              succeeding classes of Scholars.
