Abstract    :
              Interval methods and software have been developed over the years               
              for a wide range of problems in scientific computing.  However,                
              in order to be able to apply these methods, which give results of              
              guaranteed accuracy, one needs to find ways to improve the                     
              efficiency of the computations.  For ill-conditioned problems                  
              variable precision interval computation is often effective.  The               
              two main approaches investigated in this project involve                       
              improving the efficiency of variable precision computing                       
              and parallelizing the interval algorithms for speed-up using                   
              distributed networks of computers.  Preliminary studies indicate               
              the possibility of very significant speed-up times when the                    
              methods can be parallelized for a network of computers.  The                   
              investigator has obtained some results for a problem from                      
              chemical engineering and for a problem involving the onset                     
              of turbulence in wind shears.                                                  
                                                                                             
              As algorithmic progress is made, it will become possible to solve              
              other important real world problems with guaranteed accuracy.                  
              Such guarantees are crucial in many engineering problems                       
              involving safety and environmental issues.
