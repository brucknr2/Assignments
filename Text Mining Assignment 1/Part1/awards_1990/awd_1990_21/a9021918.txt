Abstract    :
                   Laboratory experiments to simulate ice particles in cirrus                
              and convective clouds will investigate conditions for break up                 
              and separation of electric charge.  A system will be constructed               
              to generate monodisperse ice crystals of selected size and shape               
              whose optical properties will be examined in a specially designed              
              and constructed optical system.  Results will be compared with                 
              field data already obtained during flights through hurricanes,                 
              maritime convective cells off Florida, convective feeder clouds                
              in North Dakota and new data to be obtained on the NOAA P3 during              
              CAPE (1991).  This will include measurements of electric field                 
              and microphysical evolution (ice particles, coalescence drops and              
              their electric charge) as convective clouds evolve overland in                 
              Florida.  Results will also be compared with radiation and other               
              aircraft data obtained by higher flying aircraft in cirrus as it               
              becomes available.  A simple numerical model of heat evolution in              
              convective clouds will be constructed applicable to assessing the              
              vertical heat budget of deep convective cloud systems involving                
              both ice and coalescence precipitation processes.
