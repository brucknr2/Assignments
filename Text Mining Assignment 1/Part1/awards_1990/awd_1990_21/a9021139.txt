Abstract    :
                   The theoretical physics group at the University of                        
              California Berkeley (S. Mandelstam, B. Zumino, M. Gallard, L.                  
              Hall and O. Alvarez) will carry out research over a broad area                 
              of particle theory.  The topics include the random                             
              triangulation approach to 2-D gravity and its application to                   
              non-critical strings, applications of quantum groups to                        
              superstring theory, string perturbation expansions with space-                 
              time supersymmetry, new inflationary cosmology scenarios.
