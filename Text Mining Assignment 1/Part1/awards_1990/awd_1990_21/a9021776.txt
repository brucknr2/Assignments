Abstract    :
              This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                
              award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to                    
              Rockefeller University for the renovation and repair of the                    
              Protein Sequencing Facility which houses protein chemistry and                 
              bipolymer research, research training, and research services that              
              are integral to the research of over 100 Rockefeller University                
              investigators in biochemistry and in cell and molecular biology.               
              This building was constructed in 1930 and last renovated in 1982.              
              The ARFMP grant of $275,000 and $424,461 provided by the grantee               
              as cost sharing will be used to modernize these research and                   
              research training facilities.  This project will address the need              
              to improve the current research infrastructure by (a)                          
              consolidating into one location the activities of protein                      
              sequencing, peptide and oligonucleotide synthesis, and amino acid              
              analysis; and (b) installing the necessary utilities so that a                 
              hydrofluoric acid hood and cleavage apparatus and an Applied                   
              Biosystems peptide synthesizer can be operated.                                
                                                                                             
              This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                     
              providing an improved environment for supplying vital research                 
              services to an excellent faculty widely known for the                          
              significance of their biological research and for the training of              
              quality graduate and postdoctoral students.
