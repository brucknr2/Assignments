Abstract    :
              This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                
              award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to                    
              Scripps Institute of Oceanography of the University of California              
              San Diego for the renovation and repair of Sverdrup Hall which                 
              houses a wide diversity of research activities in geophysics,                  
              geochemistry, biochemistry, space physics, marine geology, and                 
              biological oceanography.  This building was constructed in 1960 and            
              has not previously been renovated.  The ARFMP grant of $550,000 and            
              $585,303 provided by the grantee as cost sharing will be used to               
              modernize these research and research training facilities.  This               
              project will address the need to improve the current research                  
              infrastructure by renovating the electrical power system and the               
              heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system so that                
              modern research equipment and computers can be operated and samples            
              and equipment can be protected from the deleterious effects of                 
              exposure to the salt-air environment.                                          
                                                                                             
              This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                     
              providing an improved environment for the conduct of more and                  
              better research in marine sciences in particular and for the                   
              increased effectiveness of all research and research training                  
              conducted in Sverdrup Hall.  It will enable scientists at Scripps              
              to pursue ongoing investigations and to move quickly and                       
              efficiently into new areas of research, and it will facilitate the             
              production of even higher quality graduate students who will, as               
              they have in the past, move on to faculty positions throughout the             
              nation where they will have an impact on the quality of ocean                  
              sciences in this and future generations.
