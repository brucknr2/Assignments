Abstract    :
              This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                
              award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to                    
              Oklahoma State University for the renovation and repair of its                 
              research and research training facilities for physical and                     
              chemical materials research located in the Physical Sciences                   
              Building.  This building was constructed in 1960 and has not been              
              renovated since that time.  The ARFMP grant of $800,000 and                    
              $800,000 provided by the grantee as cost sharing will be used to               
              modernize these research and research training facilities.  This               
              project will address the need to improve the current research                  
              infrastructure by providing upgraded utility systems; heating,                 
              ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC); and additional fume                   
              hoods.  The renovation will be of particular benefit to Oklahoma               
              State University's research on synthesis and characterization of               
              optical materials, which is one of the leading research efforts in             
              the nation in this area, and it will enable the clustering of                  
              faculty with common interests.                                                 
                                                                                             
              This award contributes to the infrastructure of science and                    
              engineering by providing an improved environment for the conduct               
              of research and for the training of undergraduate and graduate                 
              students in the field of materials research.  This renovation will             
              help Oklahoma State University fulfill the major commitment it has             
              made to increasing the number and quality of students in the human             
              resources pipeline through Research Experience for Undergraduates,             
              Research Careers for Minority Scholars, Young Scholars, and similar            
              programs directed especially toward populations that are                       
              underrepresented in the field.
