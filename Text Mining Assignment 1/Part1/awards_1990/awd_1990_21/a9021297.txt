Abstract    :
                   The Malacology Collection in the Florida Museum of Natural                
              History includes more than 250,000 lots, principally New World                 
              freshwater and land mollusks.  This collection has grown rapidly               
              during the past decade through integration of several large and                
              important "orphaned" collections, abandoned by other                           
              universities, museums, and private collectors.  Dr. Fred                       
              Thompson, Curator of the collection, proposes to add 159 specimen              
              cabinets to the collection, all of which would be mounted on a                 
              compactor system that was recently shifted from the Museum's                   
              Archeology Department to Malacology.  This shift has added 47% to              
              the area allocated to Malacology, and the requested cabinets will              
              provide expansion space for approximately 10 years and will                    
              allow orphaned collections to be captured without delay.                       
                   The proposed project will enhance the growth and improvement              
              of an important natural history collection.  Researchers in                    
              systematic biology, ecology, population biology, and many other                
              fields will benefit from the heightened accessibility of these                 
              research collections.
