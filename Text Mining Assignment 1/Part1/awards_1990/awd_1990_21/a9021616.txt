Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The performance of the mammalian brain is dependent on a                       
              continuous supply of oxygen and glucose.  When brain cells are                 
              deprived of these nutritive substances present in blood, neuronal              
              function and viability are endangered.  Little is known regarding              
              the mechanisms that operate during such ischemic insult or the                 
              factors that favor recovery.  It is recognized however, that                   
              ischemic brain cells rapidly synthesize and release unsaturated                
              fatty acids and platelet activating factor (PAF), both of which                
              act to release calcium from its intracellular site of storage                  
              known as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).  Dr. Brostom has                      
              provided evidence that calcium mobilization from the ER provokes               
              rapid shutdown of the synthesis of all cellular proteins.  Upon                
              continued incubation, recovery of protein synthesis is observed                
              immediately when preceded by an increase in a glucose-related                  
              protein, GRP78, a resident of the ER.  GRP78 is hypothesized to                
              function in protein processing, the last stage of protein                      
              synthesis.  This research will investigate the importance of this              
              protein in the functioning of neurons with depleted calcium                    
              stores.  Neuronal cells in culture will constitute the primary                 
              model system.  Gene expression for GRP78 will be modulated to                  
              prove that an increase in this ER protein is required for the                  
              recovery phase.  Efforts will be made to determine the importance              
              of GRP78 content in the processing of proteins by neurons with                 
              inadequate ER calcium.  Experiments using free fatty acids and                 
              PAF will be performed to test for the capacity of influencing                  
              protein synthesis, protein processing and GRP78 content under                  
              conditions that prevail during brain ischemia.  Results from this              
              study will provide insight on the role of GRP78 during the                     
              regulation of protein synthesis in neuronal ischemia.
