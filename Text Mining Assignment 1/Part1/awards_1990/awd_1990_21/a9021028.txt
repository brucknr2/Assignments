Abstract    :
              The research project involves the design, development and                      
              experimental demonstration of a model that integrates time with                
              object databases.  Preliminary evidence suggests that existing                 
              notions of temporal data must be modified because of the                       
              transition from the relational to the object model. As such, this              
              model is the first step towards the synthesis of an integrated                 
              object model that supports the temporal aspects of data modeling               
              in addition to the structural and dynamic ones.  Investigations                
              to be undertaken include: (a) the study of the semantics of time               
              and the development of a set of temporal principles to be used as              
              an underlying basis for the design of our temporal object model;               
              (b) the study of the temporal aspects of objects and the                       
              development of a model for integrating time with objects and the               
              formalization of the model; (c) the augmentation of the data                   
              modeling power of object and semantic modeling concepts,                       
              particularly versions, with temporal modeling concepts; (d) the                
              extension of an archetype extensible object database model to                  
              incorporate notions of time; and (e) the development of suitable               
              user interfaces.  Anticipated applications of these                            
              investigations are in engineering, business, medical information               
              systems, scheduling, computer aided design and computer                        
              integrated manufacturing.
