Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary objective of this U.S.-Bulgaria cooperative                        
              research project between Dr. Robert Begg of the Indiana                        
              University of Pennsylvania and Dr. Boian Koulov of Sofia                       
              University is to study the impact of current changes in                        
              Bulgarian national policies on the regional organization                       
              of manufacturing.  Efforts will focus largely on a case                        
              study of the Burgas region of Bulgaria chosen because it                       
              is the fastest developing region and the site of a                             
              massive petro-chemical complex with manufacturing heavily                      
              concentrated around the city of Burgas.  The researchers                       
              intend to examine the effects of the decentralization of                       
              administrative and economic decision-making on the                             
              territorial organization of manufacturing as Bulgaria                          
              moves away from a centrally planned economy toward a                           
              market-oriented economy.  In order to understand the                           
              changing pattern of production and the causes, the                             
              researchers will:  establish the historical context and                        
              baseline data, identify and analyze national policy                            
              instruments, and undertake fieldwork in the Burgas                             
              region.  Results should help chart the socioeconomic                           
              impact of new national policies on local economic                              
              planning, decision-making at the plant level, firm                             
              start-ups and plant failures.                                                  
                                                                                             
              This project in geography and regional science fulfills                        
              the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge                        
              by enabling leading researchers in the United States and                       
              Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool                       
              research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and                      
              competence.
