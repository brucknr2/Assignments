Abstract    :
              This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                
              award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to Mount              
              Holyoke College for the renovation and repair of Carr Laboratory               
              which houses that institution's polymer chemistry, physical                    
              organic chemistry, biophysical chemistry, and enzyme mechanisms                
              and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy research and research              
              training activities.  This building was constructed in 1954 and                
              has not been renovated since that time.  The ARFMP grant of                    
              $100,000 and $100,000 provided by the grantee as cost sharing will             
              be used to modernize these research and research training                      
              facilities.  This project will address the need to improve the                 
              research infrastructure by bringing the laboratory benches,                    
              cabinets, sinks, and fume hoods up to modern standards and by                  
              making the bench tops chemically resistant and level once again.               
              The proposed renovation will have a clear and significant impact               
              on the quality, quantity, and diversity of research and research               
              training pursued at Mount Holyoke.                                             
                                                                                             
              This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                     
              providing an improved environment for the conduct of research and              
              for the training of quality undergraduate students.  Mount Holyoke             
              is regarded as the leading producer in the United States of women              
              chemists who go on to earn the Ph.D. degree.  This renovation will             
              allow Mount Holyoke College to maintain its long tradition of                  
              preparing some of the most talented young women in the country for             
              careers in chemistry and related sciences.
