Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor is a multisubunit protein                 
              with an integral ion channel.  The binding of acetylcholine to                 
              its receptor site, on excitable membranes of nerve and muscle                  
              cells, causes the ion channel to open, allowing small cations to               
              enter the cell.  As a result of cation entry, the cell membrane                
              becomes depolarized.  The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor has a               
              number of binding sites for ligands that regulate the receptor's               
              function.  The purpose of this research project is to understand               
              the molecular events that occur during channel activation, by                  
              studying the relationship between the structure and dynamics of                
              acetylcholine-like molecules, known as agonists, and the specific              
              steps leading to the opening of the ion channel.  Experiments                  
              utilizing radioligand binding, electrophysiological recording,                 
              nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and computational                      
              chemistry techniques will be performed to study the detailed                   
              molecular interactions between agonists and receptor.  Because                 
              the acetylcholine receptors and number of structurally related                 
              ligand-gated ion channels are important transducers of                         
              information in the nervous system, a better comprehension of the               
              molecular events associated with channel activation is crucial to              
              the understanding of the nervous system in general.
