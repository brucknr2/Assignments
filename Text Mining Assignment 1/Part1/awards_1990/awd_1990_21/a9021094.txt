Abstract    :
              Charged species moving in viscous media move at varying rates                  
              under the influence of electric fields, dependent on the                       
              acceleration due to the field competing with the drag of the                   
              medium.  A device which measures the relative speed of motion                  
              of different ions is an ion mobility spectrometer.  In this                    
              research, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry                    
              Program of the Chemistry Division, Prof. McMinn will use an ion                
              mobility spectrometer to identify and quantify trace organic                   
              species.  The species will be separated from the medium in                     
              which they are initially found by supercritical fluid                          
              extraction.  The work will be performed largely by                             
              undergraduates.                                                                
                                                                                             
              Selectivity for organic species will be achieved both by                       
              varying the properties of the supercritical fluid used for                     
              extraction and by varying the parameters of the ion mobility                   
              spectrometer.  This two-dimensional approach will give enhanced                
              selectivity compared to either method alone.  Both                             
              supercritical fluid extraction and ion mobility spectrometry                   
              are relatively new techniques.  Thus, their combination will                   
              afford types of separations and specific analytical methods                    
              heretofore unexplored.
