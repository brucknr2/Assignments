Abstract    :
                   Nonlinear optical materials form the basis of the emerging                
              "photonics" technology. II-IV semiconductors have some of the best             
              nonlinear optical figures of merit for applications in photonic                
              devices. However, these materials have not yet been developed to               
              the point where devices can be made.                                           
              %%%                                                                            
                   The goal of this research project is to characterize the                  
              properties of materials such as ZnSe and CdxMnxTe relevant to                  
              device applications and to characterize the properties of prototype            
              devices. This project will be carried out in the OSU Center for                
              Laser Research and as a joint university-industry interaction with             
              Eagle-Picher Research Laboratories.
