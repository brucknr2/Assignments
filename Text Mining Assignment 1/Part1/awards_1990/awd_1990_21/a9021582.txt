Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              American University is establishing a connection to NSFNET via a               
              1.544 million bits per second line through the SURANET mid-level               
              network.  The connection enhances collaborations of campus                     
              scientists with colleagues at other institutions, and allows access            
              to libraries and other remote facilities throughout the internet.              
              This award funds part of the costs for one year.***//
