Abstract    :
              This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                
              award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to the                
              University of Kentucky for the renovation and repair of the                    
              Chemistry-Physics Building which houses the Department of                      
              Chemistry and the Department of Physics and Astronomy.  This                   
              building was constructed in 1960 and last renovated in 1988.  The              
              ARFMP grant of $690,000 and $4,025,000 provided by the grantee as              
              cost sharing will be used to modernize these research and research             
              training facilities.  This project will address the need to improve            
              the current research infrastructure both in terms of health and                
              safety and of the quality of research that can be conducted by                 
              providing fume hoods that are in compliance with current codes, by             
              insuring the adequacy of air-handling exhaust systems, and by                  
              removing and replacing all transite (cement asbestos) duct work.               
                                                                                             
              This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                     
              providing an improved environment not only for research in                     
              chemistry and physics but also more broadly, because these                     
              departments have a central role in various interdisciplinary                   
              programs at the University of Kentucky and because a number of                 
              faculty and students from other state institutions in the area                 
              utilize these facilities.
