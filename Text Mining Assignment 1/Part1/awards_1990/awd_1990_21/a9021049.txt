Abstract    :
                   In the last twenty years, largely due to the increased                    
              application of computational methods, the ocean has become                     
              understandable through means other than observation and                        
              experimentation. Now numerical analysis permits observation of                 
              classic analytic behaviors on the scale of an ocean.                           
              %%%                                                                            
                   The purpose of this research is to develop dynamic, physical,             
              and graphic laboratory models of large scale ocean and/or                      
              atmospheric circulation; presenting data in a more accessible                  
              manner. This will ultimately benefit ocean exploration and future              
              possibilities of underwater habitation.
