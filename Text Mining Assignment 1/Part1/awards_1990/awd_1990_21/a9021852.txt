Abstract    :
              This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                
              award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to                    
              Beloit College for the renovation and repair of the Chamberlin                 
              Science Building which houses that institution's biology research              
              and research training activities.  This building was constructed               
              in 1967 and has not had any major renovations since then.  The                 
              ARFMP grant of $146,000 and $170,020 provided by the grantee as                
              cost sharing will be used to modernize these research and                      
              research training facilities.  This project will address the need              
              to improve the current research infrastructure by facilitating                 
              the conduct of a greater diversity of projects.  The renovation                
              can be expected to reduce contamination that currently                         
              challenges some research efforts and to allow investigations to                
              proceed with more exacting controls.                                           
                                                                                             
              This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                     
              providing an improved environment for the conduct of research and              
              research training of quality undergraduate students.  In this                  
              biology program, individual research is dominant and students,                 
              alone or together with faculty, are trained primarily through                  
              their own independent investigations.
