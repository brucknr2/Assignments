Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The purpose of the proposed studies is to further the                          
              understanding of how the brain controls voluntary movements.                   
              Voluntary movements are controlled, in part, by the motor areas                
              of the cerebral cortex. This control is accomplished by                        
              correlated activity of specific groups of brain cells, or                      
              neurons. Each group of neurons is responsible for the control of               
              individual muscles. Therefore, an understanding of the mechanisms              
              of motor control is contingent upon deciphering the circuits that              
              link these neurons into functional groups. Furthermore, knowledge              
              about the interactions among different functional groups is                    
              important. This information can be obtained by identifying the                 
              functional properties of single neurons, and then defining the                 
              specific connections that link them into neuronal groups. These                
              studies require an interdisciplinary approach, combining                       
              electrophysiological recordings of neuronal activity, labeling of              
              neuronal pathways, and electron-microscopical examination of                   
              connections between identified neurons. The importance of this                 
              research is that it contributes to fundamental knowledge about                 
              motor control.
