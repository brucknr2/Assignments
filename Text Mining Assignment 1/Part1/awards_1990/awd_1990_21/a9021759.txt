Abstract    :
              This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                
              award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to the                
              University of Houston-Clear Lake for the repair and renovation of              
              the Bayou Building which houses biological research and research               
              training activities.  This building was constructed in 1975 and                
              has not been renovated since that time.  The ARFMP grant of                    
              $125,000 and $155,146 provided by the grantee as cost sharing will             
              be used to modernize these research and research training                      
              facilities and will permit the clustering of faculty members who               
              are now dispersed or who currently have no assigned laboratory                 
              space.  This project will address the need to improve the current              
              research infrastructure by providing more usable space, adequate               
              ventilation and lighting, and growth chambers for all laboratories             
              which are to be modernized.  The greater interactions among faculty            
              and students that accrue from this renovation can be expected to               
              enhance collaborations and the quality of ongoing research.                    
                                                                                             
              This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                     
              providing an improved environment for the conduct of research and              
              for the training of quality students in a department with a                    
              particular commitment to educating nontraditional students and to              
              preparing students for advanced education in the sciences.
