Abstract    :
              This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                
              award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to San                
              Diego State University for the renovation and repair of the                    
              Industrial Arts Building so that it will accommodate the currently             
              scattered geological and geophysical research and research training            
              activities of the Department of Geological Sciences.  This building            
              was constructed prior to 1960 and has not been renovated since that            
              time.  The ARFMP grant of $300,000 and $489,583 provided by the                
              grantee as cost sharing will be used to modernize these research               
              and research training facilities. This project will address the                
              need to improve the current research infrastructure by installing              
              adequate utilities, lighting, ventilation, work spaces, and storage            
              areas.  The centralized location that will be established will                 
              preclude the current necessity of transporting contaminant-                    
              sensitive materials between facilities for analysis.                           
                                                                                             
              This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                     
              providing an improved environment for the conduct of research and              
              for the training of quality undergraduates and master's degree                 
              students, and, notably, in the absence of a doctoral program, of               
              postdoctoral students.
