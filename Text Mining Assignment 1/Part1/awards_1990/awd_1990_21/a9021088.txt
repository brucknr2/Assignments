Abstract    :
              This award is made as the starter grant increment of Dr.                       
              Schey's Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Chemistry Award in                 
              support of his research at the Medical University of South                     
              Carolina. The thrust of Dr. Schey's research is the development                
              and construction of a versatile time-of-flight mass                            
              spectrometer and its application to the analysis of very large                 
              molecules of biological interest.                                              
                                                                                             
              A versatile, tandem time-of-flight mass spectrometer will be                   
              constructed which is ideally suited to produce structural                      
              information on very large molecules. Ionization by matrix-                     
              assisted infrared laser desorption and broadband emission from                 
              a point source flashlamp will be investigated to improve                       
              ionization efficiency for biomolecules.  Photodissociation by                  
              both CO2 laser and flashlamp emission will be explored as a                    
              means to characterize the structure of large biomolecules.  The                
              ability of surface induced dissociation to generate                            
              structurally important fragmentation will be evaluated.
