Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Different primate species are characterized by differing patterns              
              of dispersal.  It is generally felt that the dispersal pattern is              
              an adaptation which may increase the selective fitness of                      
              individuals by increasingly their likelihood of mating and hence               
              passing their genes on to subsequent generations.                              
                                                                                             
              Both chimpanzees and baboons are present in the Gombe Forest of                
              Tanzania and each demonstrates a different dispersal pattern.                  
              Among chimpanzees, about half of the females leave their natal                 
              group permanently and half leave temporarily.  Among the baboons,              
              it is the males who emigrate but the age of first dispersal                    
              varies from 3 to 9 years.  Additionally, some female baboons                   
              leave their natal range at the time when groups divide.                        
                                                                                             
              In order to attempt to understand the costs and benefits of the                
              different patterns, the PIs will cooperate with Jane Goodall in                
              the use of her detailed field notes; notes which extend back for               
              as much as 20 years.  In addition, they will extend the studies                
              of both species at Gombe for the next three years by direct                    
              observation.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              In cooperation with Tanzanian scientists, they will also test the              
              relationship of the richness of the habitat to the dispersal                   
              patterns by initiating new studies on the plant species                        
              distributions within the ranges of each species.
