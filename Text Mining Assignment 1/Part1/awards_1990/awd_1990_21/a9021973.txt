Abstract    :
              The research aims to study seismic cone penetration tests                      
              in granular soil by conducting tests in a calibration                          
              chamber. Shear wave velocities will be measured in the                         
              horizontal and vertical planes. The microscopic soil fabric                    
              will be measured using the section-microscope method and                       
              resonant column tests. In the numerical studies, a                             
              particulate calibration chamber will be simulated using a                      
              coupled discrete element /boundary element scheme.
