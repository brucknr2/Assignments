Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                            
              Rama is an obsolescent Chibchan language of Nicaragua.  The goal               
              of this project is to produce a 2500-entry dictionary by                       
              consolidating, correcting, updating and adding to data already                 
              available such as Lehmann (1914), Diccionario Elemental Rama                   
              (Craig, 1987) and the data base produce for a grammar of Rama                  
              (Craig, 1988).  The dictionary will include a grammatical sketch.              
              The entries will include illustrative sentence examples in                     
              addition to grammatical, semantic and cultural information.  The               
              dictionary is intended as a model for future dictionaries of the               
              other indigenous languages of Nicaragua, as a reference work for               
              general linguists and as a tool for Chibchan comparative studies.
