Abstract    :
              This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                
              award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to the                
              University of Arkansas Fayetteville for the renovation and repair              
              of the physics building which houses the research and research                 
              training activities of the Department of Physics.  This building               
              was constructed in 1951 and has not been renovated since that time.            
              The ARFMP grant of $500,000 and $590,250 provided by the grantee as            
              cost sharing will be used to modernize these research and research             
              training facilities.  The project will address the need to improve             
              the current research infrastructure by providing central air                   
              conditioning; adequate power lines; and adequate power, water,                 
              vibration-free tables, benches, shelves and other essentials; and              
              additional fume hoods.                                                         
                                                                                             
              This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                     
              providing an improved environment for the conduct of research and              
              for the training of undergraduate and graduate students at the                 
              only institution in the state of Arkansas that offers the                      
              doctorate in physics.
