Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A U.S.-U.S.S.R. workshop in the field of multiphase flow                       
              systems will be held in Chicago, Illinois in May 1991,                         
              organized by Drs. James Hartnett (University of Illinois,                      
              Chicago) and Raymond Viskanta (Purdue University) on                           
              behalf of the Midwest Universities Energy Consortium,                          
              and Dr. Oleg Martynenko of the Luikov Institute of Heat                        
              and Mass Transfer, Minsk.  The primary objective of the                        
              workshop is to identify opportunities for scientifically                       
              promising collaborative research partnerships of mutual                        
              benefit involving U.S. and Soviet investigators and to                         
              prepare proposals for long-term cooperative research                           
              projects for submission and competitive review.                                
                                                                                             
              Multiphase flow problems are of vital concern to a broad                       
              range of industries, including petroleum and gas                               
              production, power generation, chemicals, and others.                           
              However, our understanding of the basic principles and                         
              behavior of these systems is quite limited, potentially                        
              leading to failures of process design, safety hazards,                         
              and limited economic benefit.  The complementary                               
              expertise and capabilities of the U.S. and Soviet                              
              research efforts in this field are expected to contribute                      
              toward improved understanding of these processes.                              
                                                                                             
              This project fulfills the program objective of advancing                       
              scientific knowledge by enabling leading researchers in                        
              the United States and the U.S.S.R. to combine comple-                          
              mentary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong                            
              mutual interest and competence in the field of basic                           
              scientific research on the basis of equality, reciprocity,                     
              and mutuality of benefit.
