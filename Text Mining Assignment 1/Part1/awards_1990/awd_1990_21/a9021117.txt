Abstract    :
                   The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) is the second               
              largest professional society of computer and information                       
              scientists and engineers in the United States.  ACM has an                     
              international membership of approximately 80,000.                              
                   The project is expressly designed to address a well                       
              documented lack of information concerning the nature of                        
              disability in science and engineering professions.  ACM will                   
              utilized the information resulting from the assessment in                      
              attracting individuals with disabilities to the computer and                   
              information science profession in general and ACM membership and               
              participation in particular.  They will use the information to                 
              plan the development and modification of member policies to                    
              increase the quality of service for disabled members.  Potential               
              specific results include:                                                      
                   * Improved planning for conferences, symposia, and workshops              
              to ensure equal opportunities for professionals with                           
              disabilities, both ACM members and nonmembers, to participate.                 
                   * Determine alternatives for regular member services                      
              including publications to make them more accessible to members                 
              with disabilities.                                                             
                   *Identify means to attract more individuals with                          
              disabilities to the computing professions in general and ACM                   
              membership in particular.                                                      
                   The project is directly related to the interests and                      
              objectives of the NSF Computer Information Science and                         
              Engineering Directorate in that CISE represents the computing                  
              profession within NSF and is particularly interested in                        
              furthering opportunities for professionals with disabilities in                
              computer and information science.
