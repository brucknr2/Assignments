Abstract    :
              This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                
              award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to the                
              University of Detroit for the renovation and repair of the                     
              Chemistry Building which houses the research and research training             
              activities of the Chemistry Department.  This building was                     
              constructed in 1926 and last renovated in 1965.  The ARFMP grant of            
              $200,000 and $254,400 provided by the grantee as cost sharing will             
              be used to modernize these research and research training                      
              facilities.  This project will address the need to improve the                 
              current research infrastructure by modifying the space, electrical             
              and ventilation systems, and the hood capacity and other                       
              furnishings of three outdated laboratory areas.  These                         
              modifications will result in the creation of three new                         
              laboratories meeting current health and safety standards which                 
              will be used for (1) chemical characterization and testing, (2)                
              physical measurement and computation, and (3) polymer synthesis.               
              This award contributes to the infrastructure of science and                    
              engineering by providing an improved environment for the conduct               
              of research and for the training of undergraduate and graduate                 
              students in a department with a particular commitment to local                 
              outreach programs that are making a clear impact upon the                      
              recruitment of students, including minority students, into                     
              chemistry.  The renovation will encourage gifted minority students             
              to go into the fields of science and engineering at the University             
              of Detroit which has a significant enrollment of Black students.
