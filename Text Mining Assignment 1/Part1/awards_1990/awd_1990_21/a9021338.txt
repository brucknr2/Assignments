Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This FAW recipient is internationally known in the fields of                   
              biostratigraphy and paleoceanography. This award will allow her                
              to concentrate future research efforts, in part, on the                        
              evolution of the Tertiary fauna after the K/T boundary mass                    
              extinction. And,it would permit long range research planning, and              
              completion of a Maastrichtian through Cenozoic quantitative data               
              base to provide constraints on climate modeling, oceanic                       
              circulation models and evolutionary theories.
