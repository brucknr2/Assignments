Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The respiratory and circulatory systems of the body can be                
              stimulated when carbon dioxide and hydrogen ions activate certain              
              brain cells (neurons).  These neruons are considered to be                     
              chemosensitive and, based on earlier studies, were thought to be               
              localized exclusively along one surface of the brainstem, i.e.,                
              the ventrolateral medulla oblongata.  Recent evidence, however,                
              now suggests that chemosensitive neurons have a wider                          
              distribution than previously believed and that they are also                   
              located in a region called the nucleus of the solitary tract.                  
              Both of these regions will be studied.  Chemosensitive neurons                 
              are thought to provide tonic input to both the cells that                      
              generate breathing rhythm and the cells that control vascular                  
              tone.  Chemosensitive cells also maintain the acid-base balance                
              during periods of metabolic disturbance and changes in the                     
              external environment.  Despite the importance conferred on these               
              neurons, the exact neural pathways and cellular mechanisms by                  
              which they produce their effects are not known.  In the proposed               
              studies, electrophysiological recordings will be made from these               
              neurons and their responses to changes in oxygen level, acid-base              
              balance and drug application will be studied.  The cells will be               
              localized and the way in which they are connected to other parts               
              of the brain will be investigated.  This work will contribute to               
              fundamental knowledge of how the brain controls the respiratory                
              and circulatory systems of the body.
