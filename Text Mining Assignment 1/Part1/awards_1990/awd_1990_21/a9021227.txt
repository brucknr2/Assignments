Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Certain snake venoms contain toxins, called alpha-neurotoxins,                 
              which cause muscle paralysis by blocking the normal action of the              
              neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, at its site of action on the                  
              muscle surface.  One of these toxins, called alpha-bungarotoxin,               
              has been particularly useful to biochemists interested in                      
              studying the acetylcholine receptor on the muscle membrane.  In                
              order to understand the action of these toxins at the muscle                   
              receptor and to determine what it is about the alpha-bungarotoxin              
              molecule that targets it for the muscle receptor, synthetic genes              
              can be produced for this protein.  With the gene in hand one can               
              develop a procedure for preparing large amounts of genetically-                
              modified toxin.  By systematically altering different parts of                 
              the toxin protein, one can identify the sites on the toxin which               
              "recognizes" the receptor.  The determination of the structural                
              changes in the protein will depend on sophisticated new                        
              techniques taking advantage of instrumentation using high                      
              magnetic fields and radiofrequency pulses.  This type of                       
              recognition is also how drugs recognize their target sites.  This              
              work will help us understand the chemically-important structures               
              which allow chemicals and biological molecules to interact.
