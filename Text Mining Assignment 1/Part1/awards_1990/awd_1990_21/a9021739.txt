Abstract    :
              This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                
              award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to                    
              Trinity University for the renovation and repair of Moody                      
              Engineering Building which houses research and research training               
              activities of the Department of Chemistry.  This building was                  
              constructed in 1966 and has not been renovated since that time.                
              The ARFMP grant of $288,650 and $288,650 provided by the grantee               
              as cost sharing will be used to modernize these research and                   
              research training facilities.  This project will address the need              
              to improve the current research infrastructure by alleviating                  
              insufficiencies in the heating, ventilation and air conditioning               
              (HVAC) system, modifying the spatial configuration, and providing              
              adequate fume hoods and bench space.                                           
                                                                                             
              This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                     
              providing an improved environment for the conduct of chemical                  
              research and for the training of quality undergraduate students.               
              Trinity University is an institution with a particular commitment              
              to recruiting and graduating women and minorities in science and               
              its Department of Chemistry is experiencing significant growth in              
              course enrollments and in the numbers of majors who go on to                   
              attend graduate school.
