Abstract    :
              This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                
              award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to the                
              Marine Biological Laboratory for the renovation and repair of                  
              Lillie Research Laboratory which contains year-round and summer,               
              nonclinical, independent research laboratories that house research             
              and research training activities in cellular, developmental,                   
              molecular and neurobiological sciences as well as in marine                    
              ecology.  This building was constructed in several phases beginning            
              in 1913 and last renovated in 1958.  The ARFMP grant of $575,000               
              and $726,600 provided by the grantee as cost sharing will be used              
              to modernize these research and research training facilities.  This            
              project will address the need to improve the current research                  
              infrastructure both in terms of health and safety and of reduced               
              risk of loss of research data and frozen samples.  The renovation              
              will provide adequate environmental control in a deleterious marine            
              climate and an emergency electrical power system, along with an                
              upgraded heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system;             
              and all asbestos will be removed from the building.                            
                                                                                             
              This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                     
              providing an improved environment for the conduct of research and              
              for the training of pre-college students and teachers as well as               
              graduate students.  Because of the international and national                  
              position of the Marine Biological Laboratory, the wider research               
              community will also benefit from this modernization.
