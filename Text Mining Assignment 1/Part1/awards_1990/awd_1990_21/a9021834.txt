Abstract    :
              This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                
              award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to the                
              University of Mississippi for the renovation and repair of Lewis               
              Hall and the accelerator building which, after the consolidation               
              to be accomplished, will house all the physical research and                   
              research training activities of the Department of Physics.  These              
              buildings were constructed, respectively, in 1939 and 1950.  Lewis             
              Hall has never been renovated, while the accelerator building was              
              last renovated in 1980.  The ARFMP grant of $889,260 and $1,264,607            
              provided by the grantee as cost sharing will be used to modernize              
              these research and research training facilities and to consolidate             
              all research training activities in physics in one contiguous                  
              facility.  This project will address the need to improve the                   
              current research infrastructure by eliminating water leakage,                  
              providing adequate power, and achieving proper climate control to              
              enable more reliable and meaningful experiments to be carried out.             
                                                                                             
              This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                     
              providing an improved environment for the conduct of research and              
              for the training of quality undergraduate and graduate students.               
              The Department of Physics at the University of Mississippi has a               
              particular commitment to educating nontraditional students who                 
              would be unlikely to go to college outside the mid-south or to                 
              begin graduate school outside this region.
