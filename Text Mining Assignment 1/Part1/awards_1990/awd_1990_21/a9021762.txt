Abstract    :
              This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                
              award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to the                
              University of Wisconsin-La Crosse for the repair and renovation of             
              Cowley Hall which houses research and research training in aquatic             
              studies.  This building was constructed in 1965 and last renovated             
              in 1974.  The ARFMP grant of $120,000 and $128,400 provided by the             
              grantee as cost sharing will be used to modernize these research               
              and research training facilities and thereby enhance the Department            
              of Biology and Microbiology's comprehensive aquatic research and               
              research training program which has substantially expanded its                 
              capabilities in the areas of aquatic toxicology and chemistry in               
              the last decade.  This project will address the need to improve the            
              current research infrastructure by (a) upgrading existing                      
              ventilation, heating and air conditioning (HVAC), (b) modifying                
              existing electrical and plumbing systems, and (c) adding or                    
              replacing laboratory benches, fume hoods, sinks, water conditioning            
              units, and other  laboratory fixtures in order to improve the                  
              utility and safety of existing facilities.                                     
                                                                                             
              This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                     
              providing an improved environment for the conduct of research and              
              for the training of quality undergraduate students.  Students                  
              trained in these laboratories are well prepared to enter graduate              
              programs or to directly enter the work force to help meet the great            
              regional and national demand for professionals with formal training            
              in aquatic toxicology and chemistry.
