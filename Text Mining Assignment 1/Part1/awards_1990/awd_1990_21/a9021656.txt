Abstract    :
              The primary focus of this research is to process taxonomic data as             
              they relate to the taxonomic hierarchy and to biological                       
              classifications.  Information-processing models will be developed              
              for such important issues as interactions between classifications,             
              efficient representation of classifications in a shared and                    
              distributed environment, common frameworks for developing the                  
              taxonomic hierarchy across disciplines, and various query-                     
              processing strategies for hierarchic taxonomic databases.  These               
              information-processing models will lead to the development of a                
              conceptual framework for designing and implementing databases for              
              taxonomic information.  A prototype taxonomic database system will             
              be built on the foundation of these new concepts.  Recursive                   
              relation structure and a new idea on defining views for recursive              
              relations will facilitate the implementation approach.
