Abstract    :
              In this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and                            
              Organometallic Program of the Chemistry Division, Gladfelter                   
              will study how certain catalysts promote the conversion of                     
              nitroaromatic compounds into isocyanates.  A possible outcome                  
              of the project is a safer and more environmentally benign                      
              method for the production of isocyanates, an important class of                
              commercial chemicals.                                                          
                                                                                             
              Attempts will be made to elucidate the mechanism of the                        
              homogeneous catalytic carbonylation of nitroaromatics, a                       
              reaction that may be capable of replacing the current phosgene-                
              based technology for the production of isocyanates.  The                       
              methods involve kinetic studies of the catalysis, in situ FTIR                 
              and NMR spectroscopies conducted at high temperature and                       
              pressure, and isolation and characterization of catalytic                      
              intermediates.   Three ruthenium carbonyl catalysts will be                    
              studied: a monomer containing the bis(diphenylphosphino)methane                
              ligand, the recently discovered binuclear species containing                   
              two bis(dimethylphosphino)methane ligands, and triruthenium                    
              dodecacarbonyl.
