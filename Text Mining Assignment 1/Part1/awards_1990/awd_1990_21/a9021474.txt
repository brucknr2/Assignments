Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              These studies will elucidate molecules and mechanisms involved in              
              directional growth of axons.  Monoclonal and polyclonal                        
              antibodies will be raised and employed to identify antigens                    
              expressed in the chick neural retina that play a functional role               
              in retinal axonal growth and directionality.  Transplantation                  
              experiments in vivo and in organ culture will be performed to                  
              study the role of chemotropic mechanisms in orientation of                     
              retinal ganglion axons.  These studies promise to provide                      
              fundamental information on the molecular mechanisms involved in                
              axonal growth in development, as well as in regeneration.
