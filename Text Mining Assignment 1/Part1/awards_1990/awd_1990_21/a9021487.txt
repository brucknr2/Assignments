Abstract    :
              This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                      
              continuing work of Professor Closs at the University of Chicago.               
              The results of this research will be of central importance in the              
              areas of physical organic chemistry and biophysics. Intramolecular             
              electron transfer and energy transfer processes will be studied in             
              rigid molecules. Individual factors that govern these processes                
              can then be determined.                                                        
                                                                                             
              Dr. Closs proposes to effect intramolecular electron transfer by               
              means of pulse radiolysis in rigid molecules. By this means the                
              effects of free energy of reaction, distance over which electron               
              transfer occurs, stereochemistry, solvent effects, and temperature             
              effects may be analyzed. In these rigid molecules, it is expected              
              that these effects may be analyzed by the examination of the                   
              structure of the molecule. In a similar manner, triplet energy                 
              transfer will be studied. Short-lived biradicals in solution will              
              be examined by a newly developed EPR technique in a related study. //
