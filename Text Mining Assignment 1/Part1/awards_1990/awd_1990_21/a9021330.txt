Abstract    :
              This research, in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program                 
              of the Chemistry Division, will study electron capture by                      
              molecules.  Electron capture finds application in                              
              identification and quantification of certain classes of                        
              molecules, most prominently halogen containing molecules which                 
              are of biological and environmental importance.  Prof.                         
              Grimsrud's research uses mass spectrometry to observe the                      
              process of electron capture and to quantify trace contaminants                 
              in samples.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              The unique aspect of Grimsrud's work is his use of                             
              photodetachment modulation.  This improves specificity and                     
              sensitivity in analytical measurements.  One can also                          
              differentiate electron capture capabilities of ground states                   
              and excited states, which is important in understanding how                    
              photochemistry modifies the chemistry of halogenated compounds                 
              in the environment.  The study of secondary processes                          
              (processes preceeding or succeeding the electron capture event)                
              also is indicative of details of atmospheric pressure gas-phase                
              chemistry of the studied compounds, and is useful in                           
              understanding unexpected sensitivity in analytical measurements.
