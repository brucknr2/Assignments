Abstract    :
              The participation of vinyl isocyanates as 4-electron partners                  
              in various cyclocondensation reactions will be studied in order                
              to extend the reactivity profile of these interesting reagents.                
              The program will focus on novel reaction partners such as                      
              nucleophilic carbenes, isocyanides and other species in an                     
              attempt to make a wide range of heterocyclic ring systems                      
              easily accessible. Also, an important objective will be the                    
              development of intramolecular versions of these newly                          
              discovered reactions. A second area will be to examine the                     
              unique characteristics of vinyl isocyanides. It is envisioned                  
              that these species represent an effective equivalent to an                     
              "umpoled" version of the vinyl isocyanate series. The                          
              usefulness of these compounds in a range of synthetic problems                 
              will be investigated.                                                          
                                                                                             
              %%%                                                                            
                                                                                             
              With this award the Synthetic Organic Program of the Chemistry                 
              Division will support the research of Dr. James H. Rigby of                    
              the Department of Chemistry at Wayne State University. The                     
              program will develop synthetic methodology for the preparation                 
              of nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds using vinyl                      
              isocyanates and vinyl isocyanides as reagents. The structural                  
              features of the heterocycles are found in a wide variety of                    
              important natural products and thus are significant synthetic                  
              targets.
