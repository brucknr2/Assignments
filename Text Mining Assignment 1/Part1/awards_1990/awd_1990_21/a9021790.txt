Abstract    :
              This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                
              award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to                    
              Florida A & M University for the repair and renovation of Jones                
              Hall which houses that institution's research and research                     
              training activities in biology, chemistry, and physics.  This                  
              building was constructed in 1940 and last renovated in 1974.  The              
              ARFMP grant of $600,000 and $771,320 provided by the grantee as                
              cost sharing will be used to modernize these research and research             
              training facilities.  This project will address the need to improve            
              the current research infrastructure by upgrading existing                      
              laboratories so that they can accommodate research in molecular                
              genetics, ecology, biochemistry, superconductivity, and                        
              computational physics.  A major focus of the renovation will be on             
              replacing the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC)                
              system so as to eliminate the risk of damage to major instruments              
              such as the electron microscope, spectrometers, x-ray                          
              diffractometers, and computers.                                                
                                                                                             
              This award contributes to the infrastructure of science and                    
              engineering by providing an improved environment for the conduct               
              of research and for the training of quality undergraduate and                  
              graduate students.  The proposed renovations will be beneficial to             
              the training of a significant number of minority scientists at a               
              rapidly growing institution with an high enrollment of Black                   
              students.  Florida A & M's strong graduate feeder program which                
              places baccalaureates of the University in a select number of                  
              major graduate institutions throughout the nation contributes both             
              to the nation's manpower needs and to its science capabilities.
