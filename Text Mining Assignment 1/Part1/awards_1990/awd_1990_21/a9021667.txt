Abstract    :
              Auburn University requests support from NSF for connection of its              
              campus network to SURAnet.  SURAnet is the midlevel network located            
              in the southeastern United States where Auburn University is                   
              located. SURAnet will provide operations management and information            
              services and it will give Auburn a high speed connection (1.5                  
              milliion bits per second) to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45                
              million bits per second) National Backbone network.                            
                                                                                             
              Auburn University needs greater functionality and network speed to             
              be able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file                     
              transfers along with being able to implement a more reliable mail              
              system. Students and faculty research will benefit from the link.              
              This is also a unique opportunity for the school to explore                    
              innovative educational resources.***
