Abstract    :
                   This award will partially support the operation of the                    
              Chicago Air Shower Array (CASA), which has been in construction                
              for the last three years under an NSF grant and is located at                  
              the site of the Fly's Eye II detector at Dugway Utah.  CASA                    
              operates is coincidence with a muon array built by the                         
              University of Michigan at Dugway.  These complimentary arrays,                 
              the largest and most sensitive of their kind, will carry out a                 
              program of observations in a search for sources of Ultra High                  
              Energy gamma radiation (Energy above 1014 eV).  The discovery                  
              of such source or sources would contribute to the resolution of                
              the decades-old question of the origin of energetic Cosmic                     
              Rays.
