Abstract    :
              This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                
              award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to the                
              University of Kansas for the renovation and repair of Malott Hall              
              which houses the research and research training activities of the              
              Department of Chemistry.  This building was constructed in 1954                
              and last renovated in 1980.  The ARFMP grant of $299,839 and                   
              $299,839 provided by the grantee as cost sharing will be used to               
              modernize these research and training facilities so as to permit               
              an active research program to continue to increase in size as well             
              as in quality.  This project will address the need to improve the              
              current research infrastructure by converting a substantial amount             
              of the current research and research training space into additional            
              laboratory space and by attending to issues of handicap                        
              accessibility as well as to those of health and safety.  In                    
              addition to reconfiguring the space, the modifications will focus              
              on the addition of new fume hoods and the replacement of laboratory            
              furniture.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                     
              providing an improved environment for the conduct of chemical                  
              research, much of which at the University of Kansas is at the                  
              important interface between bio-organic and inorganic chemistry,               
              and for the training of quality undergraduate, graduate, and                   
              postdoctoral students.  This renovation will ensure continued                  
              success for the University of Kansas in its placement of graduates             
              in academic institutions and in industrial and government                      
              laboratories.
