Abstract    :
              This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                
              award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to                    
              Wichita State University for the repair and renovation of the                  
              Wichita State Aerodynamic Laboratory which houses research and                 
              research training activities in aerospace engineering.  This                   
              building was constructed in 1949 and last renovated in 1982.  The              
              ARFMP grant of $116,000 and $116,643 provided by the grantee as                
              cost sharing will be used to modernize these research and research             
              training facilities.  This project will address the need to improve            
              the current research infrastructure by refurbishing  the wind                  
              tunnel structure including water proofing the wind tunnel tube,                
              replacing its balance system, and modernizing its data processing              
              system.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              This award contributes to the infrastructure of science and                    
              engineering by providing an improved environment for the conduct               
              of research, for developing strong linkages to state and regional              
              industry, and for the training of entry-level engineers from                   
              several major aerospace companies in the area as well as for the               
              training of quality undergraduate and graduate students.  Students             
              trained in the Wichita State Aerodynamic Laboratory, with its                  
              nationally pre-eminent program in experimental aerodynamics, are in            
              demand in both basic and applied research fields.
