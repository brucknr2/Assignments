Abstract    :
              This is a three-year collaborative research project between                    
              Drs. Marijan Dravinski and Keiiti Aki, University of Southern                  
              California, and Drs. Wen Kuo-Liang and Yeh Yeong-Tein,                         
              Academia Sinica, supported by the AIT (U.S.) - CCNAA (Taiwan)                  
              Cooperative Science Program.  This proposal plans to develop                   
              a model to predict strong ground motion during earthquakes                     
              and to calibrate this model using the 3000 earthquake records                  
              collected from the Lanyang sedimentary basin in Taiwan.                        
                                                                                             
              Local amplification of strong ground motion in a basin of                      
              sedimentary deposits is one of the most important issues in                    
              understanding earthquake hazards.  The most notable case is                    
              the amplification of ground motion in the 1985 earthquake in                   
              Mexico City, which was more than 300 km from the source of                     
              the earthquake and suffered extensive damage.  This research                   
              is very significant and can provide new insights into the                      
              nature of ground motion amplification and variation during                     
              earthquakes.  The model calibrated using the SMART1 (Strong                    
              Motion Array in Taiwan, Phase 1) data can be applied to the                    
              Los Angeles Basin to reduce uncertainties in ground motion                     
              estimation.  The damage potential for the Los Angeles Basin                    
              from a major earthquake is enormous.  This project can bring                   
              a potential reduction in the loss of life and property.
