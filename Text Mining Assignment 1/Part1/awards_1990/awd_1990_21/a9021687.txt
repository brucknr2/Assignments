Abstract    :
              The evaluation of the testing techniques, and the development of               
              an approach to the constitutive modeling of cemented soils are                 
              proposed.  Concerns are raised about the validity of the current               
              experimental approaches on cemented soils and remedies are                     
              proposed.  A constitutive modeling approach is also proposed for               
              the cemented sands.  The approach is based on the theory of                    
              mixtures. It describes the damage of the material as the                       
              cementation bonds brake.  the expected  developments will be                   
              verified through a series of example experiments and a miniature               
              foundation set up.
