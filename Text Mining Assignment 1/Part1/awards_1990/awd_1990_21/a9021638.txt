Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This action is for continued support of a field experiment                     
              designed to investigate the performance of buried pipelines                    
              when subjected to the ground shaking induced by a large                        
              earthquake; specifically the lateral offsets and ground strains                
              induced by seismic wave propagation.  This experiment has                      
              been constructed at Owens' Pasture, near Parkfield,                            
              California.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              This site was chosen so as to capitalize on the predicted                      
              recurrence of the 1966 Parkfield-Cholame earthquake                            
              sequence on the San Andreas fault.  Although this                              
              earthquake has not yet occurred, transient and residual                        
              strains in the instrumented pipe segments were measured                        
              during the October 17, 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake.  The                       
              distribution of strains in the pipes and their correlation with                
              ground movements yields important insights into the                            
              behavior of girth-welded steel pipelines of the type used for                  
              oil, gas and water transmission.                                               
                                                                                             
              Data from the Loma Prieta earthquake and from the main                         
              Parkfield event yet to occur make it possible to evaluate                      
              critical assumptions of analytical models and, if necessary,                   
              revise them.  One objective of this experiment is to evaluate                  
              current analytical models in light of the low amplitude data                   
              collected at Parkfield during the Loma Prieta earthquake.                      
              The measurements made during this earthquake indicate                          
              that when the predicted earthquake at Parkfield occurs,                        
              valuable data will be obtained from this event.  This leads to                 
              the second goal, which is to maintain the experiment                           
              through 1993 in anticipation of this predicted event                           
              occurring.  This is but one of many experiments at Parkfield,                  
              supported by federal and state agencies and non-profit                         
              institutions, which were installed and are being maintained in                 
              anticipation of the predicted earthquake occurring.
