Abstract    :
              Dr. Herzfeld's research interests concern fundamental physical                 
              relationships and transformations in biological systems.  These                
              will be pursued specifically in regard to energy transduction by               
              membrane proteins and long-range order in self-assembling                      
              systems.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              This proposal fulfills the FAW objectives which are 1) to                      
              recognize outstanding and promising women scientists and                       
              engineers in academic careers of research and teaching and 2) to               
              facilitate the further development of their careers.
