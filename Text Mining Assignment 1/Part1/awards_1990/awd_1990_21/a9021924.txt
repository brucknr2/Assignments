Abstract    :
                   The basic role of the CEDAR Science Steering Committee                    
              (CEDAR-SSC) is to provide for coordination and information                     
              transfer throughout the U.S. aeronomy community as well as in the              
              international realm.  CEDAR is currently in Phase II of the                    
              program, during which time there will be extensive funded science              
              campaign activities as well as activities involving instrument                 
              and facility development and upgrades.  The chairman for the                   
              upcoming budget period was selected by the SSC from among its                  
              members during the 1989 summer workshop.***//
