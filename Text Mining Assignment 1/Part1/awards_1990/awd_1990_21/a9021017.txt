Abstract    :
              Dr Mark Davis is receiving the Alan T. Waterman Award for his                  
              pioneering work in catalysis and catalytic materials,                          
              including the first synthesis of a molecular sieve with pores                  
              larger than one nanometer and the invention of supported                       
              aqueous-phase catalysts;  each of these accomplishments opens                  
              up a new and potentially important area in catalytic science                   
              and technology, and also has implications for separations                      
              technology and environmental control.
