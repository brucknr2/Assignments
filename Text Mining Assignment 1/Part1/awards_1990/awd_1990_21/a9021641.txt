Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Recent advances in CCD detector technology have made it possible               
              to obtain high signal-to-noise, high resolution spectra of stars               
              in wavelength and stellar brightness regimes that have seldom been             
              explored.  Dr. Meyer will use the latest generation of CCDs and                
              high resolution spectrographs at the National Optical Astronomy                
              Observatories to push the sensitivity of interstellar absorption               
              line studies.  Such studies impact on a variety of issues                      
              concerning the cosmic microwave background radiation, Big Bang                 
              nucleosynthesis, Galactic chemical evolution, and the structure,               
              composition, and chemistry of the interstellar medium.  Dr. Meyer's            
              principal goals are to obtain a detailed understanding of the                  
              cosmic and local excitation of the CN molecule in diffuse                      
              interstellar clouds and to investigate the small-scale structure               
              in the interstellar medium through observations of the interstellar            
              absorption lines toward resolvable binary star systems.
