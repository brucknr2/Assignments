Abstract    :
              Thermal analysis instrumentation is used for a variety of types                
              of experiments, including thermogravimetric analysis (TGA),                    
              differential thermal analysis (DTA), differential scanning                     
              calorimetery (DSC) and thermomechanical analysis (TMA).  This                  
              instrumentation is used to determine physical or thermodynamic                 
              properties of materials in which heat is directly involved,                    
              such as boiling, freezing and solidification-point                             
              determinations, heat of fusion and heat of vaporization.  In                   
              some cases thermal studies include measurment of weight changes                
              of a system as a function of increasing temperature.  The                      
              results of these types of analysis provide meaningful                          
              information and a deeper understanding of the effects of                       
              temperature changes on materials.  Thermal methods are used in                 
              studying materials such as polymers and ceramics.                              
                                                                                             
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation program                 
              will help the Department of Chemistry at the University of                     
              Michigan acquire a Thermal Analysis System.  The system will be                
              used in the following areas of research.
