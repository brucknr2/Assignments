Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award provides support for a post-doctoral fellow to be                   
              involved in the construction and initial operations of a two                   
              element infrared/optical interferometer.  This instrument is being             
              constructed by a consortium consisting of the University of                    
              Wyoming, University of Massachusetts, Smithsonian Astrophysical                
              Observatory, Harvard, MIT Lincoln Laboratories, and Kitt Peak                  
              National Observatory.  The instrument will be an important test bed            
              for new technologies connected with interferometry and will be used            
              in a variety of scientific programs ranging from stellar angular               
              diameters to investigations of the sizes of the nuclei of galaxies.
