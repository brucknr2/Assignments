Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Feeding behavior is critical to survival in all animal species.                
              Each type of animal employs different motor strategies in order                
              to achieve this behavior.  These movements are under neural                    
              control in all species.  Invertebrate animals with simple nervous              
              systems are useful model systems for understanding neural control              
              of behaviors in more complex vertebrates.  Dr. Ayers will study                
              feeding behavior in lobsters.  Although much is known about the                
              isolated activity of neurons controlling motor patterns in                     
              lobsters, little information is available about how the motor                  
              patterns function in the freely-moving animal during the time                  
              that it is searching for, ingesting, and digesting its food.                   
              Using the sonar telemetric instrumentation under development,                  
              recordings from muscles can be made in undisturbed animals while               
              they are feeding in a natural environment.  This work will                     
              contribute significantly to basic understanding of how elements                
              of the nervous system control feeding behavior.
