Abstract    :
              The parallel processing facility allows students in Mathematics,               
              Computer Science, Physics and Astronomy the opportunity to study               
              parallel processing and to apply this method for solving problems.             
              Students in twelve courses have hands-on experience in dealing with            
              the theory and application of parallel processing, and in facing               
              problems posed by its implementation.  The facility is the focus for           
              an on-campus 'users group' of faculty and students with expertise in           
              parallel processing.  The grantee provides funds for this project that         
              are an equal match for the NSF award.
