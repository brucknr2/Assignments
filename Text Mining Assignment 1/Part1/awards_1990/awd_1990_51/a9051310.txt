Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Through this project, the institution was able to acquire a                    
              Varian Gemini-300 FT-NMR spectrometer for improvement of                       
              undergraduate education in chemistry.  Introduction of                         
              multinuclear, high resolution NMR capabilities greatly enhanced                
              the chemistry curriculum in five areas.  1)  In organic chemistry              
              NMR is bein utilized for structural and kinetic analyses and has               
              been essential for successful microscale conversion.  2)  The                  
              integrated Lab program applies NMR to a variety of physical,                   
              organic, and inorganic problems.  3)  In biochemistry, NMR is                  
              used for the real-time analysis of metabolism and for structural               
              analysis.  4)  A new course was introduced, which integrates                   
              theory, instrumental design, and applications of NMR at a level                
              suitable for undergraduates.   5)  NMR enhanced the expanding                  
              undergraduate research program.  This project has overcome the                 
              major deficiency which existed in the chemistry and biochemistry               
              curriculum at the institution by training students in a                        
              spectroscopic technique that is widely used in all areas of                    
              chemistry.  It also elevated the level of research performed by                
              undergraduates.                                                                
                                                                                             
              The institution is contributing in an amount one and one-half                  
              times the NSF funds.
