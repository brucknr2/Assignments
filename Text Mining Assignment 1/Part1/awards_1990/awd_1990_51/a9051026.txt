Abstract    :
              This project incorporates an ultracentrifuge into the undergraduate            
              Biology and Chemistry programs at Saint John's University and the              
              College of Saint Benedict.  An ultracentrifuge with vertical and               
              swinging buckets is being purchased to illustrate the principles of            
              separation by centrifugation, as well as the isolation or purification         
              of proteins, DNA's and RNA's.  Students in a variety of courses,               
              including Molecular Biology, Biochemistry, and Cell Biology, as well as        
              students involved in individual research projects, are gaining                 
              firsthand knowledge of the uses of the ultracentrifuge.  The university        
              will contribute an amount equal to the award.
