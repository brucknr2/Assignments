Abstract    :
                   An experiment will be developed to enable students,                       
              especially physics majors, to be better prepared to study                      
              resonance processes at the intermediate and advanced levels by                 
              providing experience with a simple resonance system as part of                 
              an introductory course in experimental physics.  The system to                 
              be studied is the classical damped, driven harmonic                            
              oscillator:  a mass and spring system acted upon by an                         
              external damping force and a periodic driving force.  The                      
              equipment required includes a linear air track system, a                       
              specially designed loud speaker and a sine wave                                
              generator/amplifier.  The air track provides a nearly                          
              frictionless surface upon which the mass-spring system                         
              oscillates.  The speaker, driven by the sine wave                              
              generator/amplifier, provides a periodic driving force at                      
              frequencies in the 0.10-2.00 Hz range.  Damping is introduced                  
              by attaching ceramic magnets to the sides of the air track                     
              glider, producing eddy currents in the track as the glider                     
              oscillates.  Students will measure the period of free                          
              oscillations of the mass-spring system, the damping time                       
              constant, and the amplitude of forced oscillations as a                        
              function of driving frequency for varying amounts of damping.                  
              The experience gained will help students to relate the                         
              theoretical treatment of resonance in our physical mechanics                   
              course to a number of experiments in the advanced laboratory                   
              course, where resonance processes are investigated in depth.
