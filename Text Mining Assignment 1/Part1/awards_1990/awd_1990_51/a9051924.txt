Abstract    :
              The Earth Sciences Department has made significant commitments toward          
              strengthening its program in meteorology. Recent additions to the              
              faculty, curriculum, and equipment have initiated the process. This            
              project allows for significant improvement in the quality of the               
              program by providing improvements and increased access to the                  
              meteorological data used. The department's use of the UNIDATA PC-MCIDAS        
              service is being expanded by the addition of terminals and a                   
              filesaver/storage unit to create a local area network open to students.        
              Additional components incude a microcomputer based system for receiving        
              National Weather Service DIFAX map service and high resolution monitors        
              for display of computer terminal images to laboratory discussion               
              groups. This equipment and the resulting data provides students and            
              faculty with complete access to a wide range of meteorological                 
              observations, analyzed products, and forecasts for North America.              
              Successful implementation of the project will result in an up-to-date          
              undergraduate meteorology program for Minnesota students.                      
              The university will contribute an amount equal to the award.
