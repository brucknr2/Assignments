Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to the Department of Biology at New                  
              Mexico State university to help purchase equipment to be used in               
              a new, independent, year-long physiology laboratory course.  It                
              will replace existing laboratories in animal and cell physiology,              
              will initiate laboratory teaching of microbial and plant                       
              physiology, and will supplement existing lecture courses in animal,            
              plant, microbial, and cellular physiology, and in endocrinology and            
              neurophysiology.  The course will, however, be neither subsidiary              
              to nor dependent on lecture courses.  Instead, students will hold              
              a 75-minute Tutorial and Planning workshop where they will:  (1)               
              present briefings on principles, using abbreviated written                     
              material; (2) confront live material or published information that             
              poses a problem; (3) formulate testable hypothesis that use                    
              representative methods and instruments on hand; (4) review previous            
              results in preparation for formal report writing.  Later that week             
              students will convene in an open-ended laboratory where teams will             
              learn necessary techniques and test their own hypothesis.  Students            
              will not "cookbook" nor know expected results.  The unity of                   
              experimental approaches across disciplines and the similarity of               
              problems faced by organisms across levels of organization and                  
              phylogenetic disciplines will be stressed.  Digital data                       
              acquisition and logging will be used throughout.  The grantee is               
              matching this award with non-Federal sources.
