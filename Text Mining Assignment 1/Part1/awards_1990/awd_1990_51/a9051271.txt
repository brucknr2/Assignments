Abstract    :
              In order to promote the plant sciences and integrate the interests of          
              the faculty, the college's field station forest is being utilized as a         
              living laboratory. Building on an already established foundation of            
              species sampling by freshman students, upper division students                 
              investigate anatomical, morphological, physiological, and                      
              molecular/cellular systems to measure the impact on the forest of the          
              developed/agricultural land which surrounds it. The equipment enhances         
              that previously acquired through an earlier CSIP grant, and includes a         
              photomicroscope, herbarium cabinets, spectrophotometer, refrigerator,          
              electrophoresis equipment, oxygen meter with electrode, and a plant            
              growth chamber. The college will provide an amount equal to the award.
