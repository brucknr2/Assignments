Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to the Department of Psychology at Oregon            
              State University to help purchase equipment to upgrade the                     
              laboratory with microcomputers and sophisticated software so that              
              students can experience the same level of technology that is now               
              commonly used in psychological research.  Specifically, the new                
              microcomputer laboratory will include 18 IBM compatible PC's, five             
              dot-matrix printers, an IBM compatible 386 microcomputer connected             
              to a Sytek network, and Micro Experimental Laboratory (MEL)                    
              software.  With this setup, students will experience all aspects               
              of psychological research.  They will use the Sytek network to                 
              access the computerized library retrieval service for references.              
              Instructors, teaching assistants and advanced students will use the            
              386 computer with MEL software to select and design experiments to             
              be conducted.  Stimuli specified by the experimental design will               
              be presented to the students at their PC's who will make                       
              appropriate responses on the keyboard.  These responses will be                
              recorded and transferred to the larger 386 computer or to the                  
              university mainframe computer via the Sytek network for a                      
              professional-level statistical analysis.  Finally, the results will            
              be presented on a monitor or printer for student interpretation.               
              The grantee is matching this award with non-Federal sources.
