Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Computer-controlled, high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC)                
              is a basic analytical tool and the foremost preparative technique              
              for solution characterization and separation of organic and                    
              biochemical materials.  The chemistry department at the                        
              institution identified as a curricular deficiency the lack of                  
              opportunity for the students to utilize such instrumentation.                  
              Alumni had indicated that their preparation for industrial                     
              employment and graduate study would have been greatly enhanced                 
              through HPLC experience.  Through this project, the department                 
              acquired a HPLC system possessing the durability and versatility               
              to instruct students in organic chemistry laboratory courses and               
              to enhance the education experience of undergraduates involved in              
              independent study research projects.  The acquisition of a Waters              
              DeltaPrep(TM) 3000 HPLC system has helped the department to meet               
              its curricular goals.                                                          
                                                                                             
              The institution has contributed to the project in an amount equal              
              to the NSF funds.
