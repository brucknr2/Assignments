Abstract    :
              This project implements an innovative course delivery system to                
              improve instruction to the varied student audience in introductory             
              computing.  Course delivery is based on the interactive videodisc              
              learning station where the student can, on the same device, watch              
              a video lecture and practice using the software being taught.  The             
              components of this learning station include a microcomputer, a                 
              touch-screen monitor, a laserdisc player, and videodisc courseware.            
                                                                                             
              This introductory course is required of all Computer Information               
              Systems (CIS) majors and serves over 1,000 students per year                   
              campus-wide.  Two quarters of pilot courses to determine the                   
              feasibility of this project produced very favorable reactions.                 
              This undertaking makes it possible to provide a consistent, high               
              quality course to a broad cross-section of students and contributes            
              significantly to the computer literacy of the student population.              
              The award is being matched with a greater amount (101%) by the                 
              principal investigator's institution.
