Abstract    :
                   Knowledge of modern optics is increasingly important to                   
              workers in many areas of science and technology.  Accordingly,                 
              the University of Oregon Physics Department has committed                      
              itself to the development of a strong program of research and                  
              education in the fields of optics and optical physics.  Over                   
              the last two years, three tenure-level faculty members                         
              specializing in various aspects of optical physics have been                   
              added to the Department.  An integral part of the new program                  
              is the development of an undergraduate teaching laboratory                     
              specializing in modern optics, optical technology, and                         
              spectroscopy.  The ten experiments, of which the laboratory is                 
              composed, have been designed and will be taught by faculty                     
              actively involved in optics research.  Equipment specified is                  
              almost without exception of the same type that is actually                     
              found in real research and development laboratories engaged in                 
              optics related work.  Students successfully completing the                     
              course will have acquired not only a wide knowledge of the                     
              principles of optics but will also be well versed in the                       
              practice of optics.  They will also gain exposure to simple yet                
              important techniques such as the representation of physical                    
              processes on oscilloscopes, and the computer control of                        
              laboratory apparatus.
