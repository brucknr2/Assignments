Abstract    :
              This campus of Texas A & M is the marine and maritime special purpose          
              undergraduate institution in the university system. A basic                    
              understanding of and familiarity with modern oceanographic acoustic            
              instrumentation is essential to the education of its students. The             
              acquisition of sonic detectors and sonar equipment (seismic boomer,            
              hydrophones, recorders, fathometer, etc.) is necessary for the study of        
              marine stratigraphy and sedimentation, field methods in the marine             
              sciences, geological and physical oceanography, exploratory geophysics,        
              and coastal erosion and evolution. The equipment is being incorporated         
              in courses within several departments, and greatly extends the number,         
              scope, and variety of undergraduate research projects. The equipment           
              provides state of the art instrument expertise appropriate for marine          
              and maritime careers. The university will contribute an amount equal to        
              the award.
