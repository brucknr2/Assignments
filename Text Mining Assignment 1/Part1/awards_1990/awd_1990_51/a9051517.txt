Abstract    :
                   The equipment provided here is needed to introduce a new                  
              series of experiments.  As part of an on-going development of a                
              junior-year research-grade laboratory physics course.  These                   
              experiments are to center upon coherent optics and holography.                 
              They will be added to a recently developed repetoire of                        
              experiments in the course which currently includes experiments                 
              on pulsed NMR, gamma ray spectroscopy, Compton scattering,                     
              quantum oscillations, tunneling and particle lifetimes.  This                  
              laboratory serves ten to twelve majors a year.  This laboratory                
              serves a vital function for preparing them for a graduate                      
              career.
