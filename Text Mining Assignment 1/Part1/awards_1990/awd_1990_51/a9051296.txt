Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is implementing the use of the infrared spectrometer              
              and the computer in both the chemistry classroom and                           
              laboratories.  Activities include the use of the IR spectrometer               
              to analyze organic compounds prepared by students, the use of the              
              IR to enhance students' understanding of infrared spectroscopy,                
              and the use of the computer to collect, analyze, and store                     
              infrared spectra data obtained by the students, as well as                     
              information obtained through the use of the gas chromatograph and              
              various chemical experiments.  The computer is also used in the                
              classroom for simulations.                                                     
                                                                                             
              The project has significantly upgraded the organic chemistry                   
              program by introducing routine use of the IR spectrometer and                  
              computer.  It has allowed students to become better acquainted                 
              with the sophistication level of laboratory work and research,                 
              and has improved the educational process of the entire chemistry               
              program.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              The institution contributed to the project in an amount equal to               
              the NSF funds.
