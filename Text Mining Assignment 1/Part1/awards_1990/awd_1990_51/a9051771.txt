Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry will acquire an electron-impact,                   
              thermospray mass spectrometer interfaced to a High Performance                 
              Liquid Chromatograph (HPLC) for use in undergraduate education.                
              The new instrument will provide experience in separations and                  
              mass spectrometry for students in both the American Chemical                   
              Society accredited Bachelor of Science program and the Bachelor                
              of Arts program in chemistry.  A set of new experiments has                    
              been designed which will incorporate LC-MS into the analytical                 
              instrumental courses. The new instrument will complement                       
              chromatographic systems recently acquired through Hughes                       
              Foundation funds.
