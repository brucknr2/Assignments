Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Science curriculums must include exposure to the current                       
              techniques and tools of the discipline, as well as to accepted                 
              principles and theories.  "Molecular modeling" - using                         
              computational power to dynamically model or simulate complex                   
              chemical systems - is rapidly establishing itself in both                      
              academic and industrial settings as one of the most powerful and               
              exciting tools for probing chemical phenomena.  This project has               
              brought the technique into the undergraduate organic chemistry,                
              so that the curriculum properly reflects how organic chemistry is              
              practiced and what chemists actually do; provides the student                  
              with an exciting and powerful tool for exploration and testing of              
              many fundamental principles of organic chemistry - principles not              
              easily illustrated in either the lecture or the laboratory;                    
              facilitates a deeper understanding of fundamental principles of                
              molecular structure and molecular energetics; and attracts more                
              majors by making the curriculum exciting and by allowing students              
              more creativity in their study.                                                
                                                                                             
              To implement the program, the department acquired computational                
              hardware and software to integrate molecular modeling into the                 
              second-year chemistry course as a basic tool for exploring                     
              molecular structure, molecular energetics, and chemical                        
              reactivity.  The goal of the project is to introduce students to               
              the use of the computer for modeling complex systems.  This                    
              curricular development has substantially enriched the educational              
              experience for students in a core-course which is central to the               
              training of chemists, biologists, and students going into health               
              related careers.                                                               
                                                                                             
              The three Claremont colleges, Pitzer, Claremont McKenna, and                   
              Scripps contributed to the project in an amount equal to the NSF               
              funds.
