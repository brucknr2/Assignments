Abstract    :
              A comprehensive and flexible imaging systems laboratory is essential           
              to ensure students in manufacturing engineering and image processing           
              are effectively instructed in this expanding field.  The aim of this           
              laboratory is to (a) raise the level of imaging courses from an                
              industrially-unacceptable level to an industry-standard level, and             
              (b) to allow the implementation of additional image processing                 
              courses.  The use of PC-based digital imaging systems enables                  
              students to examine and develop alternative machine vision                     
              applications and to study image processing effects. The award is               
              being matched by an equal amount from the principal investigator's             
              institution.
