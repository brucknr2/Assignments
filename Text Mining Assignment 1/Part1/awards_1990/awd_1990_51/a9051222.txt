Abstract    :
              The scope of undergraduate research projects is being expanded by              
              studying certain geophysical aspects of bedrock and surficial deposits         
              with instruments capable of measuring the radioactivity of the rocks or        
              fluids contained in the rocks. Purchase of a radon detector with               
              accessories for degassing of fluids and a gamma-ray spectrometer will          
              allow students to do these research projects. The units are rugged,            
              portable field instruments capable of use by a single individual on            
              projects such as: 1.investigation of a major crustal fracture in               
              northeastern Ohio embedded beneath several thousand feet of Paleozoic          
              strata. Details concerning position of this fault and others may be            
              established by mapping radon ascending from deep radioactive shales            
              along fractures 2. New research, resulting from a hydrogeology course          
              will use the instruments to map radon and radioactivity in glacial and         
              bedrock aquifers and assess the environmental impact. The college will         
              contribute an amount equal to the award.
