Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to the Psychology Department at SUNY,                
              Stony Brook to help purchase equipment to develop a computer-                  
              laboratory classroom in which students will perform statistical                
              simulations and run experiments that can help develop conceptual               
              understanding of the lawfulness underlying random phenomena.                   
              Experiments performed on the computers will provide concrete                   
              experiences illustrating probabilistic and statistical principles              
              which, with traditional modes of instruction, are often only poorly            
              understood by students lacking mathematical sophistication.  The               
              grantee is matching this award with non-Federal sources.
