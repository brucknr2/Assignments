Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (nmr) is an essential                  
              technique for the practice of modern chemistry and biology.  The               
              institution had spectrometers which were difficult to use and                  
              could not do many of the routine modern experiments, and were                  
              therefore an impediment to the study and use of nmr spectroscopy               
              in the curriculum.                                                             
                                                                                             
              Through this project the institution was able to obtain a 300 MHz              
              spectrometer.  The new spectrometer permits undergraduates to                  
              routinely obtain nmr spectra in the organic, inorganic, physical               
              chemistry, and cellular physiology laboratories, and student                   
              projects and senior thesis research.  The new nmr spectrometer                 
              provides such an increase in capabilities that it has had a                    
              profound effect on the nature of the experiments that students                 
              perform.  It addition, it greatly increased the rate at which                  
              they are accomplished.                                                         
                                                                                             
              The institution contributed to this project in an amount nearly                
              double the NSF funds.
