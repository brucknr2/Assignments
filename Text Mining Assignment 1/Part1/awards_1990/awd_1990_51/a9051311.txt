Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to the department of Linguistics at the              
              University of California, San Diego to help purchase a spectrograph            
              (an instrument that analyzes sound waves).  The equipment will be              
              used in the Phonetics Laboratory, and will improve those courses               
              in the undergraduate linguistics curriculum that include a                     
              component relating to acoustic phonetics, a core sub-field of                  
              phonetics that includes the study of the physical properties of                
              speech sounds.  With the aid of this instrument, students will                 
              learn about phonetics:  the relationship among the way that the                
              sounds are perceived.  During in-class demonstrations and                      
              experiments and in conducting their own experiments, the                       
              interactive nature of this spectrograph additionally will allow the            
              students to learn the scientific method, how to form and test                  
              hypotheses, and how to design an experiment.  The grantee is                   
              matching this award with non-Federal sources.
