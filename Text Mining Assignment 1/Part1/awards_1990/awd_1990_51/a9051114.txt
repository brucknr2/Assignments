Abstract    :
              This project restructures three courses in the electrical                      
              engineering curriculum to give an orderly progression through                  
              digital signal processing (DSP) into digital image processing (DIP)            
              while adequately covering the usual material found in these                    
              courses.  Electric Circuits II now provides sufficient background              
              for students to design and implement real-time digital filters on              
              a DSP chip.  Mathematics for Engineers contains enough discrete                
              transform theory for students to utilize computational DSP software            
              effectively while the course in Communication Systems develops DIP             
              through digital image display and information extraction.                      
                                                                                             
              The curriculum developments have been made possible through the                
              establishment of an applied DSP laboratory that has been created               
              with personal computers.  These together with DSP microprocessors,             
              headphones, microphones and cameras for sound and image inputs and             
              outputs permit DSP/DIP experiences as an integral part of the                  
              courses.  The award is being matched by an equal amount from the               
              principal investigator's institution.
