Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to provide Nautical and Naval Science              
              students with a 30 student Multipurpose Microcomputer teaching                 
              laboratory.  By utilizing new technologies and software, several new           
              courses are being developed.  A unique feature of this laboratory is           
              the utilization of microcomputer based hardware and software to teach          
              principals of safety in marine navigation.                                     
                                                                                             
              The equipment purchased for this project includes 80286 8MHZ machines          
              with one 3.5 inch floppy drive and one 20MB Hard Drive, 640K RAM/256           
              EMS.  These machines permit the utilization of software for Nautical           
              and Naval Science.                                                             
                                                                                             
              An RCS-100 authoring system is an important component of this project          
              and consists of a graphics panel assembly, sonic digitizer, stylus,            
              microphone assembly, and connecting cable.  The use of the sonic               
              digitizer as the students interface with the training media allows the         
              instructor to present visual support of teaching points as a panel of          
              photos, drawings or forms, or as graphics on a video monitor.  This            
              allows the instructor to direct the students attention to higher               
              fidelity graphics and objects within an are that is much larger and            
              more versatile than any video - only system.                                   
                                                                                             
              The award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal               
              investigator's institution.
