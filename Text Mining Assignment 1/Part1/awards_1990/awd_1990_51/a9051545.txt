Abstract    :
              The undergraduate computer facility is being equipped to improve               
              laboratory experiences and enhance independent undergraduate                   
              research. Student interested in perceptual phenomena were                      
              previously limited to investigating visual phenomena. With the                 
              acquisition of new equipment, students are now able to                         
              investigate a wide range of auditory phenomena as well, including              
              voice identification, speech and music analysis, and pitch                     
              discrimination. The equipment is a combination of a McIntosh                   
              computer, Farallon's MacRecorder and MacLaboratory. Students can               
              store sound stimuli in digitized form within the computer and                  
              then analyze or manipulate the sounds. They can conduct auditory               
              discrimination experiments as well as a variety of other                       
              cognitive experiments. The equipment is being used in a number of              
              courses, but predominantly in the sensation and perception                     
              course, the experimental methodology course, and independent                   
              undergraduate research. Demonstrations and auditory experiments                
              resulting from this project will have a large pedagogical impact               
              on other institutions which lack sophisticated audition                        
              laboratories. The college will contribute an amount equal to the               
              award.
