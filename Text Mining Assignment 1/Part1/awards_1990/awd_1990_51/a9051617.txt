Abstract    :
              An instructional laboratory for the teaching of intermediate and               
              project-oriented courses in Computer Science (CPS) and Industrial              
              and Engineering Technology (IET) has been established.  As a result            
              CPS students are able to get a concrete feeling for abstract                   
              concepts introduced in the Data Structures and AI and Machine                  
              Learning courses through the medium of programming robotic                     
              effectors.  These effectors can be used to move chess pieces on a              
              board for example.  Students are able to better grasp abstract                 
              concepts through the generalization of their experiences in the                
              laboratory.  Similarly, IET students are afforded the opportunity              
              to acquire knowledge of how to apply AI techniques in solving                  
              factory scheduling and other related problems.  Moreover, the                  
              affected courses fosters greater interaction among CPS and IET                 
              students and their departmental faculty.  This interaction is                  
              crucial to successful teaching and student research.  It is also               
              a positive inducement towards the attraction of new majors from                
              within the university community.  The award is being matched by an             
              equal amount from the principal investigator's institution.
