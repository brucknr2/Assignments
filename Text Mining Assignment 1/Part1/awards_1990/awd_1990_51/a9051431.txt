Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Through this project, the Department of Chemistry and the                      
              Environmental Science Program acquired equipment to upgrade three              
              undergraduate laboratories which are critical components of the                
              chemistry and environmental science majors programs.  The item                 
              acquired included a modern fused silica, open tubular column gas               
              chromatograph equipped with a mass selective detector and                      
              appropriate computer hardware and software, three Andersen Air                 
              Samplers, and one ion conductivity detector (which are used with               
              the department's high performance liquid chromatograph).  The                  
              justification for the request was to add mass spectrometry to                  
              already strong undergraduate chemistry and environmental science               
              curriculums, to modernize the undergraduate gas chromatography                 
              instrumentation, and to add air quality analysis to an                         
              environmental science curriculum which was weak in this respect.               
              The GC-MS system is used in two undergraduate chemistry                        
              laboratories as well as for individual undergraduate research                  
              projects.  The Andersen Air Samplers and the ion conductivity                  
              detector are used in the Intermediate Environmental Laboratory as              
              well as for individual undergraduate research projects.                        
                                                                                             
              The institution contributed to this project in an amount equal to              
              the NSF funds.
