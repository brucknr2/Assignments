Abstract    :
              The department is purchasing an oligonucleotide synthesizer, a spin-           
              dryer, a spectrophotometer, a gel dryer-vacuum pump, and an automated          
              polymerase chain reaction apparatus for undergraduate instruction in a         
              junior year course in cell and molecular biology and for senior                
              research projects. This equipment enhances the development of the              
              laboratory course by introducing the theory and practise of site-              
              specific mutagenesis using deoxynucleotides, enhances the ability to           
              screen large numbers of clones and carry out DNA sequence analysis of          
              mutant genes, allows the preparation of large amounts of rare genes for        
              sequencing work and the preparation of probes, and provides a sensitive        
              and precise sepctrophotometer. The equipment impacts on all upper level        
              courses in the curriculum and enables the college to provide a modern          
              program in cell, molecular and developmental biology. The college will         
              contribute an amount equal to the award.
