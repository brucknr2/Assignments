              tion of cellular and small phenomena is important. The pivotal                 
              f such instruction is a universal research microscope, clinical                
              ry microscopes, and a stereo microscope which allows                           
              duate students, both in the classroom and in research settings,                
              ve themselves directly in the major challenges of modern
