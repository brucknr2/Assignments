Abstract    :
              The aim of this project is to improve instruction in four different            
              courses that utilize the Materials Testing Laboratory.  The equipment          
              includes an Automatic Testing System, and Electro-Mechanical Testing           
              System, troptometers, strain gauge, and various fixtures.  The                 
              microprocessor-based Automatic Testing System upgrades the existing            
              200,000 lb. Universal Tester to state of the art as found by                   
              graduates in high tech industries in the area.  The Electro-                   
              Mechanical Testing System extends the capability of the laboratory             
              into polymers, ceramics and composite testing in keeping with the              
              growing importance of these to surrounding industries and research             
              centers.  Experiments taking advantage of these new capabilities are           
              incorporated the curriculum of several different degree programs. The          
              award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal                   
              investigator's institution.
