Abstract    :
              Wellesley College is developing an intermediate level undergraduate            
              course on the interpretation and analysis of archaeological data with a        
              special emphasis on computer graphics processing of visual records of          
              archaeological data. Students are introduced to applications such as           
              the computer generation of maps and line drawings of material culture          
              remains from video images. Students learn how archaeologists present           
              and manipulate visual depictions of the archaeological record in order         
              to reconstruct the past and how to present one's works to an                   
              archaeological audience. The school is purchasing a MacIntosh IIx              
              computer, video camera, color videographics board, software, and               
              peripherial equipment which allow for the prcessing of visual images           
              that will form the basis of student projects in the course. The course         
              functions to channel interested students into already available                
              advanced archaeological seminars, and is intended to increase the              
              number of students pursuing graduate study in anthropological                  
              archaeology. The college will contribute an amount equal to the award.
