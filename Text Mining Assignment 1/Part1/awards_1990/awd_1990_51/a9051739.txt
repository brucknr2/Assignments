Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Through this project, the institution was able to acquire a gas                
              chromatograph/mass spectrometer and laboratory instrumentation                 
              interfaces with computers.  The utilization of the GC/MS                       
              begins in the sophomore organic course which has been converted                
              to microscale.  The GC/MS is used extensively in molecular weight              
              determination for unknowns in organic qualitative analysis.                    
              Students in instrumental analysis use the instrumentation for                  
              analyzing prepared acetylacetone complexes.  Students doing                    
              undergraduate research continue to use the GC/MS for such                      
              problems as rate comparison of nucleophilic displacements which                
              are phase transfer catalyzed versus the same reaction conducted                
              with ultrasound.  The acquisition of the GC/MS and interfacing                 
              instrumentation has greatly enhanced the chemistry program at the              
              institution.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              The institution contributed to the project in an amount equal to               
              the NSF funds.
