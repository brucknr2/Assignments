Abstract    :
              This proposal seeks funds to purchase three Gamma ray spectrometers            
              to be used in the teaching of nuclear spectroscopy in the upper                
              level undergraduate physics laboratory courses.  The spectrometers             
              have a variety of detectors which will permit student to understand            
              the significance of energy and timing characteristics of different             
              detectors and methods of optimizing the equipment.  Overall, these             
              meters will improve the quality of the upper level physics courses.
