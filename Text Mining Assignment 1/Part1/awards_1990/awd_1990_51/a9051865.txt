Abstract    :
              Students who do not plan to major in computer science or                       
              mathematics are benefitting from an updated laboratory equipped                
              with IBM PS/2 computers in "Introduction to Mathematical Reasoning             
              and Computer Programming".  Students are gaining hands-on                      
              experience in computer programming and in realistic problem solving            
              that require understanding of mathematical concepts and reasoning.             
              The institution will contribute an amount equal to the award.//
