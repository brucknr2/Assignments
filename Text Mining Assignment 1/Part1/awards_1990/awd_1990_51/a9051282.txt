Abstract    :
                   This project will support the purchase of equipment to                    
              improve the delivery of course content and to enhance student                  
              discovery of mathematical concepts in courses in linear algebra                
              and numerical analysis.  It is being funded under the                          
              Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement (ILI) Program, which                
              has the goal of supporting projects to develop new or improved                 
              instrument-based undergraduate laboratory courses in science,                  
              mathematics, or engineering.  The Instrumentation and Laboratory               
              Improvement Program provides matching support for the                          
              instrumentation necessary to implement undergraduate                           
              instructional improvements at U.S. colleges and universities.                  
                   In particular, the main objectives of this project are (1)                
              to make computer-assisted delivery of course content an integral               
              part of the teaching mode, (2) to promote the discovery of                     
              mathematical concepts by students through hands-on computer                    
              laboratory experiments and to reinforce basic concepts through                 
              courseware, and (3) to assign individualized projects to each                  
              student in the student's major field in order to enhance the                   
              symbiotic relationship between mathematics and its applications.               
              The initial focus of this effort will be in courses in numerical               
              analysis and linear algebra, with more advanced courses to be                  
              affected later.
