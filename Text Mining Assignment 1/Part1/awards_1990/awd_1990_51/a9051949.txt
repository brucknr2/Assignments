Abstract    :
              The Biology Department is introducing more hands-on cellular and               
              molecular biology into laboratory classes, and adding a new course in          
              Advanced Methods in Cell Biology. Experiments include isolation of             
              organelles, bioassays for enzymes and nucleic acids, restriction enzyme        
              analysis of plasmid DNA, growth of microorganisms under controlled             
              conditions, and fluorescence labelling of subcellular components in            
              embryos and cultured cells. To undertake these experiments, the college        
              is purchasing a refrigerated high speed centrifuge, ultrasonic cell            
              disrupter, UV spectrophotometer, analytical balance, pH meter, shaking         
              water bath, laminar flow hoods, and inverted phase and fluorescence            
              microscopes. Students are exposed to new exciting laboratory work in           
              classes in cell biology, microbiology, developmental biology, and              
              medical microbiology, in addition to the new course. More                      
              opportunities are also available for student research projects                 
              utilizing modern molecular and microscopic methods. The university will        
              contribute an amount equal to the award.
