Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to the Department of Zoology at Arizona              
              State University to purchase equipment which will help give                    
              freshman/sophomore-level, non-major students a laboratory                      
              experience involving scientific inquiry, critical thinking and                 
              evaluation skills, and student discovery using non-invasive human              
              physiology experiments as a vehicle.  The laboratory will use                  
              research-grade analogue recording equipment and transducers as well            
              as computer-matched data acquisition equipment, and computer-based             
              statistical and graphic data analysis software.  The analogue                  
              equipment will be used for student-designed experiments while the              
              computer-based transducers will be used for more organized                     
              laboratory exercises.  Throughout the laboratory, emphasis will be             
              placed on development of critical analysis of data, and an increase            
              in general and specific scientific literacy rather than the                    
              "canned" experiment-memorization driven laboratory experiences                 
              typical of human physiology courses.  In addition, the laboratory              
              experience will be designed to give a specific introduction to                 
              human body function to include areas of current interest and of                
              current misconception among college-age students.
