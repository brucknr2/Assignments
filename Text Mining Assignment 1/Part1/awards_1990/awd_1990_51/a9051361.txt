Abstract    :
              New technology is being brought into the teaching lab for pharmacology         
              to allow students to measure drug and electrolyte concentrations               
              accurately, safely, and easily with minimal hazardous waste. It adds an        
              experimental component to the teaching of pharmacokinetic concepts.            
              Bench-top analyzers with multiple analytical capabilities permit               
              chemical testing of blood components in a capillary tube with no plasma        
              separtaion required. The system can be calibrated and sample                   
              concentrations are determined photometrically by a microprocessor-             
              controlled program. The TDX system utilizes fluorescence plarization to        
              perform chemical analyses at body temperature. The Kodak DT system is a        
              dry-chemistry desk top analyzer with modules employing electrolyte and         
              colorimetric tests to provide precise levels of exogenous and                  
              endogenous substances. Each system provides a print-out of sample              
              results. These instruments are becoming more prevalent in clinics and          
              hospitals, but can also be used creatively in teaching. The university         
              will contribute an amount equal to the award.
