Abstract    :
              The electron microscopy laboratory  at ASU has both a scanning and             
              a transmission electron microscope. A course in EM, focusing on the            
              pursuit of a research project, has been offered for many years. The            
              research experience that students receive is being significantly               
              improved by offering a second course in Applications of Optical                
              Instrumentation to Student Research. This course allows selected               
              students to continue a project defined and initiated during the                
              earlier course. The purchase of an ultramicrotome, a vacuum                    
              evaporator and a research grade light microscope  allows the EM                
              laboratory to acquire items that any EM laboratory should have for             
              routine work and to respond to emerging technologies. The                      
              university is contributing an amount equal to the award.
