Abstract    :
              The Physics Department at San Jose State University is starting a              
              new laboratory course in computational physics.  The structure of              
              the course parallels that of experimental labs in which students               
              do one or two major projects in the semester.  The available                   
              projects span all fields of physics, and the course should be                  
              attractive to all majors (and perhaps some applied math and CS                 
              majors.)  The grant is adding a fast 386 clone, Mac IIx computer               
              and some supporting hardware and software to equipment already on              
              hand.  This upgrade allows the department to run a lab with 15-20              
              undergraduates, and the more powerful machines enable the students             
              to run fairly sophisticated projects.                                          
                                                                                             
              The university will match the award with an equal amount of funds.
