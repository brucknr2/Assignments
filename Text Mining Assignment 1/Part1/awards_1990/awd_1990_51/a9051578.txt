Abstract    :
              The computer controlled coordinate measuring machine (CMM) represents          
              a final phase in the development of a computer integrated                      
              manufacturing (CIM) system.  It is an addition to the current                  
              facilities that includes a 30 station PC based computer aided design           
              drafting laboratory using AutoCad software; a Harris mini computer             
              using CAD/CAM software; an 18 station PC manufacturing management              
              laboratory featuring manufacturing resource planning and simulation            
              software, and a three machine computer numerical control (CNC)                 
              laboratory scheduled for upgrade.  All are integrated via Novel                
              software and an IBM Token-Ring computing network.                              
                                                                                             
              The CIM has become a part of the CIM network and, using the CMM                
              software, is able to inspect parts from projects developed in the              
              CAD and CAM Laboratories.  The CMM is used primarily by the Materials          
              Testing and Measurements Class, but has impact on Statistical Quality          
              Control and other courses using the CAD and CAM facilities.  The               
              award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal                   
              investigator's institution.
