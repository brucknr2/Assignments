Abstract    :
              This project integrates the use of real-time meteorological data               
              into the undergraduate studies in five departments: Biology,                   
              Chemistry, Geography and Planning, Physics and Astronomy, and                  
              Technology.  Three automatic recording weather stations provide data           
              in a rugged, mountainous area of North Carolina.  The data from                
              these stations is available on a university-wide broad-band network            
              and is available in computer and science laboratories in each of the           
              five departments.  The grantee provides funds for this project that            
              are an equal match for the NSF award.
