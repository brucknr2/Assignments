Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectroscopy has become a vital tool for               
              the analysis of environmental samples and of drugs of abuse.  The              
              demand for chemists with experience in GC/MS is growing rapidly                
              and will continue to grow as the technique is incorporated into                
              more technology laboratories.  The GC/MS in this project is being              
              introduced at the freshman level through observation of                        
              demonstrations.  In the sophomore year, the students in organic                
              chemistry have hands-on experience through interpretation of                   
              spectra and the identification of unknowns.  In the analytical                 
              chemistry course students get their first introduction to the                  
              design of the instrumentation and its quantitative applications.               
              As an experimental tool, the GC/MS will be used in the realm of                
              advanced preparation.                                                          
                                                                                             
              The school has contributed to this project an amount 11% greater               
              than the NSF funds.
