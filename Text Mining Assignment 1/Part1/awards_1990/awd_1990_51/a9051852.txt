Abstract    :
              An integrated photosynthesis system, which includes a self-contained           
              infra-red analyzing  set-up, a lap-top computer, and a plant growth            
              chamber, is being used in the freshman course, General Biology, to             
              demonstrate how the rate of photosynthesis is easured prcisely. In the         
              sophomore-level General Ecology course it is used to conduct a primary         
              productivity study in an ecosystem on campus, and in the junior and            
              senior level Plant Structure and Function course it is used by students        
              to measure accurately and precisely rates of photosynthesis and                
              respiration under different conditions. Each Plant Structure and               
              Function student  is required to design and conduct an experiment in           
              which the system is used to measure photosynthesis. The university will        
              contribute an amount equal to the award.
