Abstract    :
              The institution incorporated several laser experiments into its                
              physical chemistry laboratory.  A continuous wave Helium-Cadmium               
              laser and a small double monochromator are used to construct a                 
              low-resolution Raman spectrometer which also functions as a                    
              fluorimeter.  Both forms of the instrument use a versatile                     
              computer interface to allow control of scanning, the acquisition               
              and manipulation of data, and the subsequent plotting of results.              
              The department also acquired a low-cost pulsed nitrogen/dye laser              
              and associated electronic for use in short time-scale (10-100ns)               
              measurements of luminescent lifetimes.  These measurement are                  
              used to analyze the collision-induced energy transfer between                  
              excited metal complexes and organic quenchers.  The laser-based                
              experiments not only expose majors to modern optics and computer-              
              based data acquisition techniques, but also emphasize a                        
              flexible, building-block (as opposed to "black-box") approach to               
              experimental design and computer software.  This project                       
              emphasizes a low-cost approach toward the introduction of current              
              spectroscopic techniques to undergraduate laboratories.                        
              Implementation of the experiments should be of interest to other               
              institutions seeking to sustain student interest in physical                   
              chemistry                                                                      
                                                                                             
              The institution contributed to this project in an amount equal to              
              the NSF funds.
