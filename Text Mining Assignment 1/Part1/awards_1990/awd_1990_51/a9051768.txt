Abstract    :
              This project creates a laboratory for signal processing and                    
              instrument interfacing.  The two workstation laboratory demonstrates           
              state-of-the-art signal processing using simple object oriented                
              programming of familiar computers.  The laboratory is multi-                   
              disciplinary with applications in Computer Science, Mathematics,               
              Physics, Biology, Chemistry, Communication, and Music.  Topics                 
              covered include digital and analog signal production, signal                   
              transmission through practical media, signal reception, and                    
              processing.  Specific topics include modems, signal synthesis,                 
              harmonic analysis, programming signal processors, computer-                    
              instrument interfacing, and computer networks.  The laboratory                 
              enhances the student's understanding of the technical and economic             
              limits of computers and communication.  Students interface sensors             
              with computers and evaluate their limitations.  The students also              
              write and test signal processing software and use signal processing            
              software to evaluate the technical limits of various real-world                
              systems.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              The award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal               
              investigator's institution.
