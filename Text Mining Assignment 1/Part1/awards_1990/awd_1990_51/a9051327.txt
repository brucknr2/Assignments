Abstract    :
              In a physiology course covering both animals and plants, laboratory            
              methods for collecting and recording data are being greatly improved. A        
              series of experiments are being developed to give students the                 
              opportunity to collect and analyze data with state-of-the-art                  
              transducers and instrumentation, and a computerized data acquisition           
              system. In addition, computer simulations of other physiological events        
              are being used, allowing for practical lab experience, realistic               
              experimental design, and data analysis in a short period of time and at        
              low cost. These experiences will better prepare students for advanced          
              individual research projects, internships, further education, and              
              jobs. The course is unique in that it combines fundamental principles          
              of cell, animal, and plant physiology. The college will contribute an          
              amount equal to the award.
