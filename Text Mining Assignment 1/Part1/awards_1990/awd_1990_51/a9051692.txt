Abstract    :
              This project establishes electronically instrumented laboratories as           
              part of a plan to more closely integrate laboratory demonstrations and         
              experiments with the classroom instruction of engineering mechanics.           
              New and interesting experiments and demonstrations are incorporated            
              into the curriculum so as to create an engaging laboratory environment         
              and encourage student interest in engineering mechanics. Courses are           
              affected in the sophomore, junior and senior years.  The equipment             
              purchased is a computer controlled data acquisition system.  This              
              system enables progressive instruction in methods of modern data               
              acquisition and culminates in a senior laboratory project in which the         
              students must plan and implement an electronically instrumented test of        
              a non-traditional construction material.  The award is being matched by        
              an equal amount from the principal investigator's institution.
