Abstract    :
              This project establishes a microcomputer based teaching facility for           
              non computer science majors who need to know how to use the computer as        
              a problem solving tool.  The facility consists of thirty workstations          
              connected to the instructor's console by a device that will enable him         
              to see and interact with each student's computer from the console.             
              Also connected to the console is a projection system to facilitate             
              group instruction.  The system will allow the instructor to take over          
              any workstation, interact with it, and project it onto the screen for          
              class discussion.                                                              
                                                                                             
              This facility greatly enhances the lecture/recitation instruction              
              format and the teaching of high level computer skills to non-majors in         
              an effective way.  Personalized "hands-on" instruction is provided to          
              many students simultaneously.                                                  
                                                                                             
              The award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal               
              investigator's institution.
