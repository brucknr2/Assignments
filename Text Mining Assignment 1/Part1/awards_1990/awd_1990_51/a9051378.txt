Abstract    :
                   The focus of this project is the development of an                        
              undergraduate software engineering laboratory which utilizes                   
              the most advanced techniques available.  This includes CASE                    
              tools, automated project management, object-oriented                           
              programming, distributed project development and others.  The                  
              purpose of the laboratory is to provide hands-on experience                    
              for undergraduate students.  Potential applications areas for                  
              students to investigate include embedded real time systems.                    
              A cluster of SUN Microsystems SPARC workstations and                           
              Interactive Development Environments' Software through                         
              Pictures are to be acquired.                                                   
                   This project establishes a state-of-the-art laboratory                    
              for software engineering which is badly needed at the                          
              undergraduate level.  Such laboratories will address the                       
              national need for well trained software developers.
