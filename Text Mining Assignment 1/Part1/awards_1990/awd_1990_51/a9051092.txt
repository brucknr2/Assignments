Abstract    :
              This project upgrades the required Electrical Engineering courses              
              in Digital Electronics, Introduction to Microprocessors, and Senior            
              Design.  Key instruments include development systems composed of               
              Z80 Emulator/Analyzers, Z80 Emulator/Analyzer User Interfaces and              
              Software, along with 386 based Personal Computers.  The use of the             
              Z80 emulation capability of the development systems permits                    
              students to debug software efficiently, thus allowing more complex             
              and realistic laboratory projects to be performed.  In addition,               
              the logic analysis capability of the development systems coupled               
              with the acquisition of a printed circuit board router system                  
              permits the efficient construction and testing of digital                      
              circuitry.  Thus a complete design/development environment for                 
              microprocessor based systems is available to students in the                   
              targeted courses for projects appropriate for modern applications.             
              The award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal               
              investigator's institution.
