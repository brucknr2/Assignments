Abstract    :
              Colgate University is teaching a "hands-on" laboratory in the                  
              course in geophysics which focuses on the shallow subsurface                   
              environment.  Such investigations are becoming more crucial as                 
              groundwater shortages and groundwater pollution become more common.            
              The course is a modification of the senior-level geophysics course             
              which is being changed so that the lab focuses on those techniques             
              which are most applicable to the shallow subsurface:  gravity,                 
              seismology, and earth resistivity.  The labs are structured in 3               
              modules, each dealing with with one of the techniques.  The first              
              week of each segment is devoted to measurement techniques and data             
              reduction.  The following 2 weeks are devoted to data collection               
              within a segment of the Chenango River Valley, a glacially buried              
              valley  containing approximately 500 feet of sand and gravel.  The             
              final week of each segment is devoted to modelling the subsurface              
              using two-dimensional techniques and personal computers.  Each                 
              year, the course will investigate a segment of the valley using all            
              three techniques.  Over the years, a larger picture of the valley              
              will be acquired as one group of students merges their results with            
              those of years past.  Students are also encouraged to utilize the              
              equipment in senior research projects.                                         
                                                                                             
              The university is matching the award with an equal amount of funds.
