Abstract    :
              Modern instruments are powerful tools of analysis and their use is             
              emphasized in the beginning organic chemistry laboratory, where the            
              students learn of gas and high performance liquid chromatographs               
              (GC, HPLC), and infrared, nuclear magnetic resonance, ultraviolet,             
              and mass spectrometers.  These instruments, especially  the IR and             
              GC, are used extensively not only for simple analysis of products              
              from reactions and distillations but for the separation of complex             
              mixtures to test mechanistic hypotheses (carbocation                           
              rearrangements).  Undergraduate research is receiving increased                
              emphasis at the institution.  In a small college all instruments               
              serve not only the beginning and upper class labs but the research             
              students as well, so these instruments must produce quality data               
              under demanding conditions and must be flexible enough to meet                 
              unanticipated new demands.  Through this project, the institution              
              upgraded its organic chemistry instrumentation.  They acquired an              
              easy-to-teach Fourier-transform IR and a capillary column GC.  The             
              new instruments provided significantly better data, allowed several            
              new experiments to be performed, and enabled the faculty to teach              
              new technologies.  The institution contributed to this project in              
              an amount equal to the NSF funds.
