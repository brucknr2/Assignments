Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to the Rochester Center for Economic                 
              Reearch at the University of Rochester the help purchase equipment             
              which will be used to teach quantitative social sciences,                      
              specifically economics and political science.  Students currently              
              get little exposure to the quantitative aspects of economics and               
              political science because of the lack of a centralized facility for            
              this purpose.  As a result, many do not have a very good idea of               
              the nature of quantitative research in the social sciences.  The               
              funds from this award will allow the development of laboratory-                
              based undergraduate education in this setting.  Innovative                     
              classroom applications such as market experiments and model                    
              simulation, as well as the expansion of traditional applications               
              in statistics and econometrics will be developed.  This facility               
              should serve as a model for similar facilities at other                        
              institutions.  In addition, students will gain a better                        
              understanding of the nature of quantitative research in the social             
              sciences, and will therefore be able to make more informed                     
              decisions about choosing careers in research and/or teaching.  The             
              grantee is matching this award with non-Federal sources.
