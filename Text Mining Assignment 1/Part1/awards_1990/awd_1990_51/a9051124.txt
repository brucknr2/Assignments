Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Through the purchase of and development of related courses and                 
              experiments, Knox College has expanded and modernized its                      
              chemistry curriculum  The acquisition of a gas chromatograph/mass              
              spectrometer has allowed the creation of an innovative and                     
              comprehensive laboratory to accompany the new Environmental                    
              Chemistry lecture course.  Ion chromatographic equipment,                      
              atmospheric sampling devices, and alternate gas chromatographic                
              detectors were also acquired and implemented within the                        
              laboratory portion of the environmental course.  The flexibility               
              of the GC/MS is permitting its usage to fortify several other                  
              laboratory offerings.  A new Inorganic Chemistry course and a                  
              revised Organic Chemistry feature spectral characterization of                 
              synthetic products using the GC/MS and existing spectroscopic                  
              instruments.  The Instrumental  Analysis laboratory has been                   
              updated by adding contemporary GC/MS experiments while trimming                
              usage of several out-of-date instruments.  Undergraduate research              
              is employing the GC/MS and its spectral library on a routine                   
              basis for structural identification and verification.                          
                                                                                             
              The institution contributed an amount equal to the NSF funds to                
              the project.//
