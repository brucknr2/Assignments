Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to improve the quality of the                      
              undergraduate curriculum by changing an existing undergraduate                 
              core course, signals and systems laboratory, into a computer-                  
              controlled instrument base laboratory course.  This project will               
              enable us to ensure that all of our graduates will have                        
              encountered modern CAD/CAM type equipment before their entry into              
              the workplace.  The contributions of the project are threefold:                
              to provide state-of-the-art computer controlled instrumentation                
              for each station within the laboratory: to increase the exposure               
              of the individual student to such instrumentation by increasing                
              the number of functioning stations, thereby limiting the number                
              of students per bench (maximum of two); and to create expanded                 
              flexibility and capabilities via PC-based laboratory stations for              
              utilization of CAD software for analysis and design.  Major                    
              equipment purchases include equipping ten complete student                     
              stations with personal computers and compatible programmable                   
              instrumentation including digital oscilloscopes, waveform                      
              generators, power supplies, and pen plotters.
