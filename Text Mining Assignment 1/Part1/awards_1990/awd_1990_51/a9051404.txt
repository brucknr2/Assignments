Abstract    :
              Most chemical engineers have no required exposure to non-                      
              traditional areas.  However, there is a growing need for                       
              biochemical engineers and many graduates will find themselves                  
              working on bioprocess related problems.  The addition of new                   
              equipment will provide for bio-related experiments in the                      
              required chemical engineering laboratory and the process control               
              course insuring that all students have minimal exposure to                     
              bioprocessing.  Further, the same equipment can be used to                     
              supplement elective courses in biochemical engineering such as                 
              bio process engineering and controlled cultivation of cells                    
                                                                                             
              Bioprocess engineering is an emerging filed for which no suitable              
              educational infrastructure currently exists.  This equipment will              
              develop a model, which if successful, will be emulated by many                 
              other chemical engineering departments.
