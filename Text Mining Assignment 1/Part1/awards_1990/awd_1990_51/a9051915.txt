Abstract    :
              The Earth Science curriculum at Pacific Lutheran University is being           
              enhanced by the development of an upper division course in geophysics          
              and the expansion and modification of the content of several other             
              existing courses. For students to experience the practical aspects of          
              geophysics, the department is acquiring a state-of-the-art seismograph,        
              an proton magnetometer, a laptop computer, an 8-color pen plotter, a           
              digitizer, and software packages to store, manipulate, process, and            
              model geophysical data. In addition, computer applications of                  
              geophysics projects and related courses are being stressed in order to         
              better prepare students for future geological careers. The university          
              will contribute an amount equal to the award.
