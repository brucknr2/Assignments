Abstract    :
              The acquisition of equipment to conduct seismic surveying and the              
              computing equipment to archive, refine, and interpret geophysical data         
              are significantly improving undergraduate laboratory experiences in            
              geophysics courses. Using a sledge hammer as an energy source, the             
              seismograph records the arrival of seismic waves that have been                
              reflected and refracted by rock layers. The laptop computer archives           
              the raw data collected in the field and transfers this data to the more        
              powerful desktop computer. Undergraduates manipulate the data, which           
              provide important information on subsurface geologic structure. Apart          
              from heavy use in geophysics courses, the equipment is used for                
              demonstration and laboratory exercises in both upper and lower                 
              division courses. Additionally the seismograph and computing equipment         
              are used extensively by undergraduates for research projects for               
              independent studies or senior theses. The research projects consist            
              largely of multi-disciplinary studies of pre-Cambrian rocks in                 
              Michigan's western upper peninsula; because of the paucity of rock             
              expsure in this area and highly irregular bedrock topography beneath           
              glacial drift, seismic and other geophysical techniques are employed.          
              The university is contributing an amount equal to 151% of the award.
