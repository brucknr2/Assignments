Abstract    :
              The Analog Circuits Laboratory Project aims at major curricular                
              revisions in the Electronic Engineering Technology program.                    
              Specifically, the analog circuits sequence is changed from an emphasis         
              on circuits as closed systems to signal processing building blocks used        
              to implement larger systems.  This change results in an increase in            
              systems-level and frequency-domain analyses.  Computer-based tools and         
              circuit simulation techniques are integrated into existing courses.            
              The Tektronix 2630 Personal Fourier Analyzer and system controller are         
              the major instruments purchased and are accompanied by Microsim PSPICE         
              Circuit Simulation software.  The students maximize their performance          
              through computer-based analysis and simulation tools.  Following the           
              design, the circuits and subsystems are built and tested for                   
              verification of performance in both the time and frequency domains.            
              The project responds to the shift in engineering practices in industry         
              and targets curricular revisions which parallel the changes in the work        
              place.                                                                         
              The award is being matched with a greater amount, 104%, by the                 
              principal investigator's institution.
