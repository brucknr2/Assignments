Abstract    :
              The aim of this project is to enhance the educational opportunities            
              available to students and to increase the instructional efficiency             
              of the courses. A video microscopy system is being used to                     
              demonstrate microscopic specimens and to teach microscopy                      
              techniques. The macroscopic capabilities of the system are used to             
              identify anatomical structures and illustrate dissection                       
              techniques. An environmental chamber enables students to examine               
              effects of environmental factors on biological processes. Ecology              
              study chambers allow students to observe intractions between                   
              organisms in an controlled environment and to perform pollution                
              studies. Spectrophotometers are used for hemoglobin determination,             
              enzyme kinetics, and water quality testing. Computers are used with            
              the video microscopy system to allow students to observe structures            
              and techniques at their own pace, to quiz themselves at their own              
              pace, and to design an interactive audiovisual presentation with               
              video discs. This equipment allows students to engage in a wide                
              variety of laboratory exercises and enhances the efficiency of                 
              laboratory instruction. The college is contributing an amount equal            
              to the award.
