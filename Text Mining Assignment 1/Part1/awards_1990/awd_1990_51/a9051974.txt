Abstract    :
                   The instrumentation of the Rutgers Physics Learning Center                
              will be enhanced through the acquisition of several computer-                  
              interfaced mechanics experiments, creation of novel mechanics                  
              experiments using videotaping techniques, acquisition of                       
              several electricity and magnetism, optics and modern physics                   
              apparatus, and computer-interfaced instruments for introducing                 
              medical applications of physics.  These experiments will be                    
              used in existing novel programs for the non-calculus based                     
              introductory physics course, calculus based general physics                    
              course, freshmen engineering physics course and a gateway                      
              physics course.  These experiments will also greatly enhance                   
              the scope of the Physics Learning Center.  Since the center                    
              provides instructional services for over 4,000 students each                   
              semester, this equipment will receive continual and heavy use.
