Abstract    :
              An important goal of undergraduate laboratory instruction in                   
              chemistry is to familiarize students with applications and                     
              techniques widely used by practicing chemists and other scientists             
              in industry and research.  The acquisition of a Fourier Transform              
              Infrared Spectrophotometer with an interfaced computer and                     
              supporting software has allowed undergraduate students in chemistry            
              to collect and store spectral data.  They are then able to use the             
              FTIR software on departmental computers for comparison of spectra,             
              spectral library searches, baseline subtractions, and other                    
              manipulations or calculations.  The combination of FTIR data                   
              collection with off line computer data management gives the                    
              students experience with practices now used in industrial and                  
              research laboratories for the analysis of infrared, ultraviolet,               
              nmr and mass spectral data.  The institution contributed to this               
              project in an amount equal to the NSF funds.
