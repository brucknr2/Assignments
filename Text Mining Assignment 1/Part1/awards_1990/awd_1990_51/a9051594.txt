Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The acquisition of the FT-IR spectrophotometer allowed the                     
              introduction and development of microscale laboratory experiments              
              at all levels of the chemistry curriculum.  Continued conversion               
              to and an increase in the variability of microscale experiments                
              occurred in the organic laboratory sequence.  The instrumentation              
              strengthened the development of the organic laboratory projects                
              which have greatly stimulated the students' interests in chemical              
              and biological research.  New experiments were introduced and                  
              modified for the physical and integrated laboratories.  The                    
              interest in polymers and surface analysis was further stimulated               
              by observing spectral properties of materials using the FT-IR                  
              reflectance accessory.  Greater student-faculty interaction in                 
              the area of research (polymer films, molybdenum complexes,                     
              products resulting from mechanistic studies) were fostered by the              
              acquisition of the FT-IR spectrophotometer.  Construction and use              
              of the spectral libraries gave the students opportunities to gain              
              skills in chemical analysis used in the environmental analysis                 
              sector.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              The institution contributed to this project in an amount equal to              
              the NSF funds.
