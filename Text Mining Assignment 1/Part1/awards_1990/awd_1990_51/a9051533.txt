Abstract    :
              The undergraduate program in aquatic biology is being strengthened by          
              expanding the scope of treatment to include microbial ecology. The             
              innovation, which involves the acquisition of a liquid scintillation           
              counter, autoanalyzer, fluorescence microscope, and lab balance, makes         
              use of experimental ecology as an educational vehicle to teach students        
              about 1. important ecological processes mediated by microorganisms; 2.         
              the microbial groups involved with specific processes; and 3.                  
              techniques for the assessment of microbial numbers, biomass, and               
              nutrient cycling. A variety of experimental exercises employing the            
              equipment are being integrated into the upper division courses of              
              aquatic biology, ecology, and limnology. The exercises are designed to         
              provide students with a broad coverage of microbial ecology. The               
              university is contributing 122% of the award.
