Abstract    :
              Equipment is being purchased to support a course in archaeological             
              field research methods. In this class, students participate in                 
              excavations to recover information from an eroding prehistoric campsite        
              located on Armand Bayou in Houston TX. Student completing the course           
              demonstrate much improved understanding of scientific research                 
              procedures and an enhanced understanding of prehistoric societies and          
              ecology. The equipment greatly improves the resources for teaching             
              essential archaeological techniques including 1. surveying equipment           
              for teaching site mapping, 2. soil flotation equipment for teaching            
              the recovery of information about floral, faunal, and other dietary or         
              environmental remains, 3. a camera and accessories for teaching                
              artifact documentation and production of publishable records of                
              artifacts, and 4. computer equipment for teaching data management and          
              quantitative analytical techniques. The university will contribute an          
              amount equal to the award.
