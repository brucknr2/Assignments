Abstract    :
                   A new laboratory course, Discovering Physics, will be                     
              enhanced by the purchase of equipment for student measurements                 
              of wave phenomena in different contexts and for measurements                   
              of electrical and magnetic phenomena.  These topics have been                  
              chosen for their accessibility and interest to non-science                     
              majors and their importance in physics.  The course is taught                  
              using a discovery approach with a minimum of lectures and an                   
              emphasis on a guided approach to student discovery of                          
              important physical principles.  Funds will be used to purchase                 
              sufficient equipment for additional students and for more                      
              sophisticated equipment that will yield more precise                           
              quantitative results and reduce one layer of student                           
              confusion.  The course is oriented especially toward students                  
              planning to become elementary school teachers, uses much of                    
              the same equipment and philosophy that most education experts                  
              claim should be used in the elementary school classroom, and                   
              has a fifty percent enrollment of female students.  Since                      
              there are no available textbooks for a course of this type, a                  
              university-level modular Discovery Workbook will be produced                   
              that can be made available to students as they learn.
