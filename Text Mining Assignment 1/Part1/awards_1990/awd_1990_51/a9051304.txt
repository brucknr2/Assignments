Abstract    :
              The department of Biological Sciences attempts to provide maximum              
              training in laboratories using hands-on experience with instruments.           
              Since data analysis in biology is based largely on the collection of           
              images (i.e. images produced from molecular analysis of vital                  
              molecules from cells and those seen in various types of microscopes)           
              the acquisition of equipment for image analysis and quantitation               
              remedies a major deficiency in the department. With this instrument the        
              department can train students in the collection, storage, and                  
              interpretation of data acquired from morphological studies of cells and        
              their structural components. Another application involves analysis of          
              fossil remains. Such training makes the students more computer literate        
              and experienced with regard to state-of-the-art image analysis. The            
              university will contribute an amount equal to the award.
