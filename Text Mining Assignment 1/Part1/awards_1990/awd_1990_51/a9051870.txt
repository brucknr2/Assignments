Abstract    :
              Characterization of materials and measurement of semiconductor                 
              device parameters are an important part of undergraduate                       
              microelectronics laboratory.  This project enhances the analytic               
              facilities of the laboratory through the addition of a                         
              semiconductor parameter analyzer.  This system enables the students            
              to characterize the electronic properties of the materials, and                
              also to test and measure their fabricated devices parameters.  The             
              unit is used in five undergraduate courses in Electrical                       
              Engineering.  The award is being matched by an equal amount from               
              the principal investigator's institution.
