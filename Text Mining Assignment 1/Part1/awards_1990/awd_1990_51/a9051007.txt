Abstract    :
              Introductory Zoology is taken by many non-science majors and is                
              the only laboratory course they will probably ever experience. This            
              course is being upgraded to include experimental laboratories in               
              which data are gathered and analyzed, so that students can better              
              understand and appreciate the scientific method. Modern data                   
              analyzing systems that are easily operated can help motivate                   
              students, including minorities, to follow an interest in science.              
              The enrichment of the laboratory experience by the addition of the             
              new equipment allows the curriculum to be upgraded to include                  
              experiments in evolution, biometry, biomechanics (form and                     
              functional complexes in locomotion and feeding), and ecological                
              relationships among organisms. The new laboratory exercises will               
              be incorporated into the laboratory manual. The university will                
              contribute an amount equal to the award.
