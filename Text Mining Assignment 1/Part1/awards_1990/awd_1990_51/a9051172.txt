Abstract    :
              Seminole Community College is developing a laboratory course in DNA            
              science, in which lower division nonscience and science majors perform         
              exciting experiments in modern molecular biology. Using gel                    
              electrophoresis equipment, microcentrifuges and a shaking water bath,          
              students make and analyze recombinant DNA molecules and transform E.           
              coli cells with recombinant plasmids.  Students verify transformations         
              by replicate plating and by isolating, purifying, and analyzing the            
              plasmid DNA in the transformed cells. Using a white light/camera               
              system, students can accurately visualize and record their results. In         
              this course students  learn the basics of an exciting new technology           
              while mastering the scientific method. During the semester length              
              course, there is enough time to grasp theoretical concepts, perform            
              basic molecular biology experiments, analyze data, critically evaluate         
              the experimental design, and discuss the potential risks of such               
              techniques. The college will contribute 106% of the NSF award.
