Abstract    :
              Baruch College is developing experiments in wave phenomena, with               
              emphasis on the acoustics of speech signals.  The rapid                        
              development, low cost and ease of operating data acquisition                   
              equipment makes it feasible for students to use this technology at             
              the introductory level.  The instrumentation consists of personal              
              computers, data acquisition boards, microphones and signal                     
              processing software.  The versatility of the human vocal tract as              
              a broad band generator of complex acoustic wave is the focus of                
              most of these experiments.  Students who take the courses in which             
              these experiments are done are mostly business majors or majors in             
              other areas.  The college will match the award with an equal amount            
              of funds.//
