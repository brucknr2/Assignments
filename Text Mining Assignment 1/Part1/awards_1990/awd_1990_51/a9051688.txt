Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Distinct and diverse laboratory experiences for undergraduate                  
              chemistry and biology students, as well as advanced high school                
              students, are involving the capabilities of an integrated gas                  
              chromatograph/mass spectrometer system.  The system features                   
              ChemStation computer software to coordinate analyses of compounds              
              in the benchtop Hewlett-Packard HP5890A GC/Hewlett Packard                     
              HP5917A Mass Selective Detector system.  Classes for both majors               
              and non-majors are using the instrumentation.  The following                   
              areas have been greatly impacted by the new instrumentation:  (1)              
              organic chemistry courses for biology and chemistry majors, (2)                
              the analytical instrumental chemistry course for chemistry majors              
              and minors, (3) chemistry courses for non-science majors with                  
              emphases in either forensic science or environmental science, and              
              (4) the Forensic Science Project for talented high school                      
              students, a two-week residential experience.                                   
                                                                                             
              The institution has contributed to the project in an amount equal              
              to the NSF funds.
