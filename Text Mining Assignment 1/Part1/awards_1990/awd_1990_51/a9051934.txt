Abstract    :
              Inter American University - Ponce, responding to increasing                    
              concerns for the environmental quality and health in Puerto Rico,              
              has developed an Environmental Science program. The final component            
              of this program is equipping the Environmental Science laboratory,             
              which will be utilized throughout the science program, be used in              
              many undergraduate science courses, and by students involved in                
              independent research projects. Other students, working with                    
              faculty, will be allowed to work with local industries in                      
              identifying potential waste problems and suggesting corrective                 
              measures. A variety of pieces of equpment will be used, including              
              an Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer to analyze metallic ions,               
              an Ultraviolet Spectrophotometer to identify organic compounds,                
              and a High Pressure Liquid Chromatography system to identify                   
              organic contaminants. The university is contributing 140% of the               
              NSF contribution.
