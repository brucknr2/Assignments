Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project extended computer interfacing, i.e., computer                     
              control over external devices, to undergraduate women science                  
              majors.  A logical building block approach is used in the                      
              fundamental course, Computer-Assisted Experimentation, wherein                 
              student gain experience with microcontroller-based systems, AST                
              computer with digital and analog I/O boards, and communications                
              systems.  These will include an introduction to robotics and                   
              remote monitoring.                                                             
                                                                                             
              The expertise gained in the fundamental course is applied in the               
              automation of data acquisition and data treatment in many                      
              experiments in the upper-level laboratory program.  Women                      
              students, in particular, need to actually carry out automation in              
              order to be confident, creative and productive in today's                      
              research labs.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              The acquisition of multiple sets of equipment and software                     
              permitted a number of students to gain crucial hands-on                        
              experience in both the fundament course and the applications in                
              the overall lab program.                                                       
                                                                                             
              The institution contributed to this project in an amount equal to              
              the NSF funds.
