Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This undergraduate facility will provide a modern approach to x-               
              ray physics for students in the physical sciences and                          
              engineering, and will provide them with a basic understanding of               
              research and analytical techniques they will encounter in                      
              graduate school or in industry.  Laboratory exercises will                     
              include modern x-ray physics, traditional x-ray diffraction, x-                
              ray spectroscopy and x-ray optics.  Equipment to be used includes              
              x-ray sources and detectors, elements of a Bragg spectrometer,                 
              NIM electronics and a control/data acquisition computer.
