Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to enhance selected courses in                
              the engineering technology, engineering transfer, and technology               
              curriculum by utilizing materials inspection and analysis and                  
              testing equipment that directly interfaces with computer-assisted              
              data acquisition hardware and software.  Data obtained through                 
              traditional materials testing and electronic image analysis is used            
              to identify correlations present, and draw conclusions based on the            
              comparison of electronic graphic characteristics and physical and              
              mechanical properties of selected materials.                                   
                                                                                             
              The award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal               
              investigator's institution.
