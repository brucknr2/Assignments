Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The institution acquired an Infowindow System to expand and                    
              improve its learning Center.  This enabled the college to promote              
              an appreciation and understanding of chemistry in the community                
              as well as strengthen the undergraduate chemistry curriculum.                  
                                                                                             
              The developed for the system are used for chemical technicians                 
              employed in area industry, for middle and high school students in              
              the area, and for curriculum students at the college.                          
                                                                                             
              This project extended the educational opportunities to chemists                
              working in the industries, allowed middle school and high school               
              students to come in contact with more elaborate and sophisticated              
              applications in chemistry, and allowed more interesting and                    
              challenging laboratory experiences for the college's curriculums               
              students.  This project also resulted in the development of new                
              video programs in chemistry, reduced health hazards, allowed new               
              experiences for students, and permitted students with                          
              disabilities to perform some labs that otherwise they would not                
              have been able to accomplish.                                                  
                                                                                             
              The institution contributed to the project in an amount equal to               
              the NSF funds.
