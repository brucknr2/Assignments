Abstract    :
              A new computer lab will help students develop abilities to understand          
              mathematical concepts, apply statistical reasoning, and process and            
              interpret data through the use of computers. The equipment includes 17         
              microcomputers networked together plus software packages for specific          
              classroom exercises. Courses that utilize the computers include                
              Genetics, Microbial Ecology, General Ecology, Biometry, Population             
              Genetics, Population Ecology, Honors Botany, and the University Honors         
              Seminar. Computer-assisted exercises are being developed for each of           
              these courses that will improve understanding of fundamental biological        
              principles, improve understanding of the scientific method in general,         
              or improve specific quantitative skills of particular importance to            
              biologists. The university will contribute an amount equal to the              
              award.
