Abstract    :
              The college is modernizing, upgrading, and revitalizing biological             
              instruction directed primarily toward freshman biology courses.                
              Instrument purchases provide opportunities for students to develop             
              skills and knowledge about computer interfaced spectrophotometers, pH          
              meters, and physiological recording apparati. While the previous course        
              was largely descriptive, the new courses use an inquiry/problem solving        
              approach to biological study, thereby enhancing the development of             
              critical thinking, data analysis, application of technology, and               
              scientific reporting. Students initially use the instrumentation in            
              pre-designed experiments and then use them to answer experimental              
              questions that they have initiated. In addition, the instrumentation is        
              shared with upper division courses in physiology, cell biology, and            
              biochemistry to enhance their laboratory experience. The college will          
              contribute an amount equal to the award.
