Abstract    :
              California State University at Chico is acquiring instrumentation              
              which improves the quality of undergraduate research and updates               
              the laboratory portion of water pollution analysis courses. The                
              instrument being purchased is a gas chromatograph with an electron             
              capture detector capable of analyzing water samples for pesticides,            
              polychlorinated biphenyls, and halogenated hydrocarbons. The                   
              project enable students to participate in all phases of research               
              from project design to presentation of results at a symposium or               
              in a journal. Their study of monitoring groundwater pollution is               
              being done in cooperation with the California Department of Water              
              Resources. The new equipment allows the students to use the best               
              available technology in their study of contemporary water pollution            
              problems. The university will contribute an amount equal to the                
              award.
