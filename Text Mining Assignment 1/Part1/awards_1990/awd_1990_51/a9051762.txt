Abstract    :
                   This project will support the expansion and upgrading of the              
              current undergraduate computer laboratory, so that each student                
              in the lab will be able to use a modern symbolic-numerical-                    
              graphical system, and directly connect to the University computer              
              system or the Pittsburgh Supercomputer Center.  It is being                    
              funded under the Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement (ILI)              
              Program, which has the goal of supporting projects to develop new              
              or improved instrument-based undergraduate laboratory courses in               
              science, mathematics, or engineering.  The Instrumentation and                 
              Laboratory Improvement Program provides matching support for the               
              instrumentation necessary to implement undergraduate                           
              instructional improvements at U.S. colleges and universities.                  
                   In particular, the main objective of this project is to                   
              increase the scope, relevance and applicability of the                         
              mathematical modelling course by adding a laboratory component in              
              which the students learn to use the most modern computer                       
              techniques available to them for application to assigned projects              
              and problems. The laboratory work will consist of independent                  
              work on tutorials with the help of a laboratory assistant, and                 
              students will be encouraged to do simple motivating experiments                
              in the lab before the mathematical analysis techniques are                     
              presented in class.
