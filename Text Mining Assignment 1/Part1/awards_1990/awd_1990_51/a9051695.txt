Abstract    :
              The Physics Department at St. Lawrence University is offering                  
              modern physics laboratory experiments in a physics course for non-             
              science majors.  The course--"Light and Matter, Waves and                      
              Particles"--focuses on the wave-particle duality.  The equipment               
              complements existing laboratory capabilities and allows for                    
              experiments demonstrating microwave optics, the photoelectric                  
              effect, and the wave and particle nature of the electron.  In this             
              way the department is making it possible for liberal arts students             
              to develop an understanding of some of the fundamental questions               
              raised by twentieth-century physics.  The university will match the            
              award with an equal amount of funds.//
