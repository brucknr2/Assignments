Abstract    :
              This project upgrades undergraduate instruction in experimental and            
              theoretical aspects of modern marine geology. The courses affected             
              range from introductory to advanced levels, and involve seismic and            
              magnetic investigation of seafloor morphology and subbottom structure,         
              and geochemical sampling of the water column and seafloor. Data and            
              samples collected are processed and interpreted using computers in the         
              laboratory. Students  write reports from the data sets collected during        
              cruises. Some of the data sets are utilized also in related courses            
              such as geophysics or geochemistry. These experiences will better              
              prepare students for industrial employment or for graduate study               
              leading to professional careers involving marine geology. The                  
              university will contribute an amount equal to the award.
