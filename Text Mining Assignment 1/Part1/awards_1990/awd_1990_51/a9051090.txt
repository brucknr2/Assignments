Abstract    :
              This project improves the Control Instrumentation, Control Systems and         
              Robotics laboratory which plays a fundamental role in the new                  
              engineering technology program.  New courses are impacted and novel            
              experiments are being developed, involving transducing techniques, data        
              acquisition, various controller structures and responses for processes         
              and systems, as well as robot arm programming and robot applications in        
              a simulated factory environment.  The experiments and software are             
              being produced in workbooks, reports and laboratory manuals.                   
                                                                                             
              An innovative new format is being given to the procedures for                  
              assigning experimental projects as the experiments are based on                
              practical problems solicited from industry.  The problems are assigned         
              and progress monitored in such a way as to emulate the conditions              
              encountered by engineering technologists in the industrial workplace.          
                                                                                             
              The award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal               
              investigator's institution.
