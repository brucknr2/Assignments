Abstract    :
              Mathematics majors are benefiting from a newly instituted capstone             
              experience that includes real-world modeling projects in actuarial             
              science, dynamical systems, and statistics.  This experience is                
              enhanced by the use of a laboratory equipped with Macintosh computers          
              running Mathematica, Fortran, and other appropriate software.                  
                                                                                             
              The institution will contribute an amount equal to the award.
