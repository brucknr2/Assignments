Abstract    :
              This project provides an interactive setting for calculus and computer         
              science students.  The laboratory equipment includes 12 microcomputers         
              linked by a LAN to a minicomputer.  This provides a broad range of             
              problem solving and graphing capabilities with sufficient                      
              computational power and graphics resolution to enhance the learning            
              process.  The grantee provides funds for this project that are an              
              equal match for the NSF award.//
