Abstract    :
              This proposal seeks funds for three goals:  (1) to give all science            
              graduates an opportunity to gain knowledge of lasers and modern                
              optics in a laboratory setting; (2) to give all physics majors an              
              advanced laboratory experience in modern optics; (3) to give                   
              Engineering-Physics graduates a two-semester course and laboratory             
              sequence in modern optics.  It is planned to achieve the above-                
              listed goals with five major pieces of equipment:  (1) a fiber                 
              optics kit; (2) a pulsed nitrogen dye laser for spectroscopy; (3)              
              a complete optics kit for interference and Fourier optics study;               
              (4) a holography kit for holographic and speckle study and; (5) a              
              laser properties package to study the properties of lasers.
