Abstract    :
              The Materials Science and Engineering Laboratory:  This                        
              laboratory is used as an engineering core laboratory to                        
              mechanical and civil engineering students to provide a basic                   
              understanding of material properties.  Additional laboratories in              
              these departments provide added study in the strength and                      
              properties of materials.  Through a sequence of laboratory                     
              exercises students are introduced to material property                         
              determination and stress analysis using both experimental and                  
              theoretical models.  However, there is a need to improve the                   
              laboratory facilities which experimentally reinforce the                       
              principles learned in the lectures courses.  The objective of                  
              this project is the acquisition of undergraduate laboratory                    
              equipment in the materials and properties analyses area to                     
              develop a more complete undergraduate introduction to material                 
              properties and stress analysis.  The improved laboratory                       
              facilities will enable students to become more knowledgeable in                
              the various methods of materials and structural analysis.
