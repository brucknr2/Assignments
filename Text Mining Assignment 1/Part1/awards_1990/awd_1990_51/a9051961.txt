Abstract    :
              The curriculum in biology is being enhanced through the acquisition of         
              an ultracentrifuge and kinetic microplate reader. The equipment is             
              being used in the Genetics, Immunology and Microbiology courses to             
              introduce new exercises which employ modern techniques and principles          
              of critical thinking. The equipment increases the variety of projects          
              students may undertake in the Methods in Research course and in                
              undergraduate student research projects. The ultracentrifuge enables           
              students to purify plasmic DNA for restriction endonuclease double             
              digestion mapping and gene cloning, and to purify prokaryotic and              
              eukaryotic genomic DNA and RNA for Southern and Northern blot analyses         
              with non-radioactive labeled probes. The kinetic microplate reader is          
              used by students for performing the ELISA immunoassay, for cell                
              proliferation studies using the MTT assay, for monoclonal antibody             
              analyses, for the Lowry protein assay and for the screning of sera and         
              cultured supernatants for the presence of antibody following                   
              immunological in vivo or in vitro stimulation procedures, respectively.        
              The equipment improves the biology program being offered to students           
              majoring in biology or allied health, many of whom are women. The              
              college will contribute an amount equal to the award.
