Abstract    :
              This project is restoring capabilities for mineralogic and                     
              crystallographic analysis of earth materials by the use of x-ray               
              diffraction. The equipment is being used in a number of courses                
              and in student research in the departments of Geology,                         
              Environmental Sciences, Chemistry, and Physics. Laboratories that              
              had been abandoned due to malfunctioning equipment are being                   
              restored, and additional laboratories in Structural Geology and                
              Sedimentary Petrology are being developed. The renovation of an x-             
              ray diffractomenter, together with previous improvements in atomic             
              absorption and x-ray fluorescence spectrophotometers, will restore             
              a variety of options for independent student research projects in              
              the affected departments as well. The college will contribute an               
              amount equal to the award.
