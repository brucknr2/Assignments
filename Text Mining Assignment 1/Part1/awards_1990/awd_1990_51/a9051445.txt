Abstract    :
              This project supports an undergraduate laboratory for information              
              visualization.  It equips the laboratory with 6 workstations and               
              high-speed high-resolution graphics subsystems as a part of a larger           
              undertaking.  It also provides for the development of courseware for           
              a new course in static and dynamic information visualization                   
              techniques under an integrated multi-media format.  Static                     
              information visualization is devoted to topics on color discourse,             
              texture-, lightening-, shading-, volume-, and shape-visualization.             
              Dynamic information is devoted to the time/space relationship of               
              processes such as algorithm visualization, event simulation, study             
              of motion, and process animation.  Media integration addresses the             
              integration of computer graphics, imagery graphics, and the                    
              video/compact disc media.  Also addressed are applications of                  
              computer aided visual technology, visual communication, visual                 
              ergonomics, animation, and scene production.                                   
                                                                                             
              The award is being matched with a greater amount (216 percent) by              
              the principal investigator's institution.
