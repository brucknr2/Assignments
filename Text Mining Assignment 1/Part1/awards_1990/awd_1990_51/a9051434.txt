Abstract    :
              The Department of Physics and Astronomy at Hunter College is                   
              undertaking a major upgrade of its three freshman laboratories.                
              Over one thousand students a year enroll in the Calculus=based and             
              the Algebra-based freshman physics courses and in a one-semester               
              Basic Concepts of Physics course.  The fifteen new laboratory                  
              experiences include a group of three kinematic experiments, tow                
              acoustic wave and four optics experiments.  The remaining five                 
              cover areas from gravitation, thermodynamics, electricity,                     
              magnetism and radioactivity.  The laboratory experiences include               
              repetition of classic experiments as well as opportunity to allow              
              a close-up touch-and-feel of basic phenomena.  A majority of the               
              laboratory experiments include computer assisted data collection.              
              Microcomputer based data analysis and graphing are provided                    
              throughout the year-long laboratory course.  The college is                    
              providing more than twice the amount of the grant in support of the            
              project.//
