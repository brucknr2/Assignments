Abstract    :
              This project involves the acquisition of a laser beam machine tool             
              to expand the capability of the existing welding and manufacturing             
              process facility.  The machine tool's laser is a coherent beam of              
              light that can be focused to a high energy density spot for the                
              welding, cutting, drilling, heat-treatment or marking of                       
              engineering materials.  Although applied mostly to metals, the                 
              laser beam can also be used to machine non-metals such as plastics             
              or composite materials.  These versatile machine tools are being               
              routinely used by industry to reduce costs and improve the quality             
              of manufactured products that require welding, cutting, drilling,              
              surface treatment, or marking and will be similarly used in this               
              laboratory.  The award is being matched with a greater amount                  
              (103%) by the principal investigator's institution.
