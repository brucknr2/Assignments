Abstract    :
              Two problems have cause the American manufacturing industries to               
              weaken.  First, manufacturing enterprises are not operated as                  
              integrated systems.  Second, manufacturing operations are still                
              short of scientific approaches.  Issues of the science and the                 
              integration of manufacturing systems must be carefully reviewed in             
              manufacturing education.  The study of "Computer Integrated                    
              Manufacturing" is intended to address the problems.                            
                                                                                             
              This project utilizes computing and networking equipment and                   
              software to refine the existing Computer Integrated Manufacturing              
              (CIM) Laboratory.   Operation with Local Area Networks permits                 
              connection to mainframe, mini and micro computers.  Activities in              
              this lab include CAD/CAM/CAE.  This enables the manufacturing                  
              students to see how their previous courses interact with each                  
              other.  This lab introduces the picture of a continuous network                
              within a CIM system.  Problems of integration, methodologies of                
              implementation, and standardization in manufacturing are                       
              demonstrated.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              The award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal               
              investigator's institution.
