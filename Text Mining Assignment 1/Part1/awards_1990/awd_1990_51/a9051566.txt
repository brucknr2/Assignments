Abstract    :
              The purpose of the project is to establish the groundwork for a                
              working computer integrated manufacturing (CIM) cell around the                
              currently available CNC machines.  The immediate (not fully automated)         
              cell will consist of a CNC lathe, CNC mill, a SCARA robot for servicing        
              the lathe, a table top jointed arm robot for servicing the mill, a             
              programmable logic controller for overall system coordination, and a           
              personal computer for on/off line programming and system operation.            
              The award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal               
              investigator's institution.
