Abstract    :
              Developing force by applying pressure to a closed container is a               
              simple enough concept; controlling the pressure and flow so that               
              the point of application of the force is constrained to move                   
              exactly as desired requires a comprehensive knowledge of fluid                 
              mechanics and automatic control theory.  The study of fluid-power              
              has become an essential part of the training of agricultural,                  
              aerospace, industrial and mechanical engineers.  Fluid-power                   
              devices may be found in equipment ranging from a garden tractor                
              to a flight simulator.  A sequence of fluid-power experiments                  
              starting with basic fluid properties and culminating in the                    
              control of linear and rotary actuators is provided to the                      
              student.  Some fluid-power controls are capable of very rapid                  
              response and instrumentation must tract this response.  The new                
              instrumentation will be capable of measuring flows, pressure, and              
              displacements at intervals of 1/1000 or less.  The fluid power                 
              industry routinely uses microcomputer based instrumentation and                
              it is essential that an engineering student should appreciate the              
              capability of such instrumentation.
