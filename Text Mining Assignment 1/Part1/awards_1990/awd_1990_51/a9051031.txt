Abstract    :
              The Physics Department is improving and upgrading the laboratories             
              associated with modern physics and optics courses.  The students               
              are performing experiments using modern methods of intensity and               
              wavelength measurements in the visible and infrared parts of the               
              electromagnetic spectrum.  The project involves the use of a                   
              monochromator, sources of optical radiation, light chopper, lock-              
              in amplifier and pyroelectric detector as major instruments.  This             
              instrumentation is being used to perform a set of experiments                  
              dealing with nature of light and light matter interaction.  The                
              experience gained with this instrumentation enables students to use            
              light as a probe in experimental investigations and sharpen their              
              experimental skills.                                                           
                                                                                             
              The university is matching the award with an equal amount of funds.
