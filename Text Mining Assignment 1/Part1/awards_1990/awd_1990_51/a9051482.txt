Abstract    :
              A Computer-Integrated Process Engineering Laboratory is                        
              established that uniquely incorporates computer integrated                     
              engineering concepts into the undergraduate curriculum by                      
              providing 'hands on' experience with modern instrumentation and                
              control systems, databases statistical analysis methods and                    
              computer-aided engineering tools as they apply to the operation,               
              analysis and design of industrial processes.  A networked cluster              
              of engineering workstations and realtime database servers                      
              interfaced with on-campus utility systems serves as a generic                  
              platform for studying the application of computer integrated                   
              manufacturing concepts in the process industries.  The real-                   
              world, on-campus utility data base coupled with state-of-the-art               
              computer software/hardware tools is an effective environment for               
              studying approaches to defining and solving problems in product                
              quality and process productivity improvement.  Additional utility              
              and  relevance of the laboratory include: focusing attention on                
              problem areas of national technical and economic importance -                  
              energy and competitiveness; being readily reproducible - almost                
              all campuses have utility systems; and, potentially providing                  
              direct economic benefits to universities utility cost reductions.
