Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project addresses the problem of preparing students to deal               
              with a variety of equipment and uses in a one-semester course.                 
              The project permitted the institution to acquire computer                      
              hardware, software, and interfacing equipment.  The course is                  
              divided into two pedagogical segments, one involving computer                  
              hardware, the other data manipulation and modeling.  The                       
              connection between the two parts is important.  The first part                 
              gives the students the opportunity to learn to determine hardware              
              requirements necessary to solve a particular problem.  The                     
              interfacing segment provides a significant component of hands-on               
              hardware experience at the chip and board level.                               
                                                                                             
              The purpose of the modeling part of the course is to teach the                 
              students a)how computer technologies can be applied in modern                  
              chemistry, and b)the various common hardware and software that                 
              are available to the chemist today.  The students who                          
              successfully complete this course have attained some expertise in              
              molecular modeling and are sufficiently familiar with a range of               
              approaches to a broad spectrum of problems so that they have the               
              perspective necessary to configure a system for a particular                   
              application or adapt an existing system to a new application.                  
                                                                                             
              The institution contributed to this project in an amount equal to              
              the NSF funds.
