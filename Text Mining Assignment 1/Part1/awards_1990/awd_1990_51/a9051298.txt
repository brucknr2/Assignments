Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project involved the construction of a cryogenic high vacuum              
              apparatus for the use of undergraduate students enrolled in                    
              Physical Chemistry Laboratory, Individual Research Studies,                    
              and/or Physical Inorganic Laboratory.  The equipment consists of               
              a cryostat with its corresponding vacuum line, two deposition                  
              lines, a diode array spectrophotometer and appropriate lamp                    
              sources for photochemical experiments.  For the two laboratories,              
              the experiments include matrix investigation on the spectrum of                
              isolated HCl, thermal ozonolysis reactions, and photochemically                
              induced isomerizations (IR source).  In addition, several                      
              undergraduate research projects are being done in the areas of                 
              atmospheric chemistry, laser deposition of thin films, solid                   
              state chemistry and lanthanide chemistry.  These experiments                   
              provide undergraduates in the areas of chemistry, physics,                     
              chemical engineering and materials science with the opportunity                
              to gain hands-on experience with vacuum technology, cryogenics                 
              and spectroscopic techniques.                                                  
                                                                                             
              The institution is contributing to this project in an amount                   
              equal to the NSF funds.
