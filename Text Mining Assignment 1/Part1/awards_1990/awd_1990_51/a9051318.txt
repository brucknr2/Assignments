Abstract    :
              Students are seeing that mathematics is an active area of                      
              intellectual inquiry and are participating in the scientific process           
              of formulating and testing hypotheses.  These efforts are underway             
              in a laboratory equipped with IBM PS/2 Model 30 computers running              
              both locally developed and commercial software.  The institution will          
              contribute an amount equal to the award.
