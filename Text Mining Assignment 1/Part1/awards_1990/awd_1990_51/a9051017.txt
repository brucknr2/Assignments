Abstract    :
              The Physics Department at Kalamazoo College is upgrading the                   
              laboratory component of an upper-level majors course, Optics and               
              Wave Motion.  Optics experiments are being performed on optical                
              breadboards, using rugged and reliable components and hardware.                
              A Macintosh II computer is linked to experiments through a GPIB bus            
              so that it controls the apparatus, takes and analyzes the data, and            
              presents the results in a useful form.  In addition to handling                
              optical signals via a photodector, the computer system functions               
              with acoustical inputs through a high-speed digitizer.  Commercial             
              software permits students to present instructions to the computer              
              with a modest investment of time for programming, as this consists             
              largely of manipulating icons on the screen.  The laboratory offers            
              quantitative experience with wave concepts, from acoustics and                 
              optics, and including Fourier analysis, in such a way as to                    
              reinforce the lecture portion of the course.  At the same time it              
              provides skills that are used in modern research and introduce                 
              techniques that are rarely accessible in the undergraduate physics             
              curriculum.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              The college is matching the award with an equal amount of funds.
