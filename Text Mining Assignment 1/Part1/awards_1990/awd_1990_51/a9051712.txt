Abstract    :
              Aim: Reinforce learning between analytical, empirical and case                 
              study methods of architectural study.  Comparison of analytical                
              results (algorithm and/or computer simulation) to physical                     
              testing of scale models and field measurements of existing                     
              building.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              Major Instruments: Microcomputer with data acquisition interface,              
              data logging capability and interface to basic and spreadsheet                 
              software.  Computer output to VGA and composite video for VHS                  
              video tape documentation.  Computer will read and record                       
              environmental data from sensors attached to scale architectural                
              models under controlled conditions.  Remote data monitoring                    
              equipment will be used for case study measurements.  Software for              
              computer simulation, data translation and analysis as well as                  
              instrument control also employed.                                              
                                                                                             
              Application: Scale architectural models are suitable for                       
              schematic design level study of daylighting, solar access, cross               
              ventilation, acoustical and other technical areas influenced by                
              the architect's design decisions.
