Abstract    :
              EL Paso Community College, with an enrollment of 16,500 students of            
              whom 71% are Hispanic, is developing a Social Science Student Survey           
              Research Center. This center is providing research experiences in              
              community surveys for students enrolled in four advanced social science        
              courses: Principles of Economics, Statistics and Research Design in            
              Psychology, Social Psychology, and Research Methods in the Social              
              Sciences. Course syllabi are being revised to incorporate data                 
              gathering and analysis utilizing computers and software. These changes         
              in curriculum, accompanying the purchase of equipment, will improve            
              students' understanding of research methodology and enhance their              
              success in pursuing further education or employment. The college will          
              contribute an amount equal to the award.
