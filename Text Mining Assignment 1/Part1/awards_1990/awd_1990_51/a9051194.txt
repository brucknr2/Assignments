Abstract    :
              A new laboratory equipped with Macintosh II computers running                  
              Mathematica and LOGO is benefiting calculus students, prospective K-6          
              teachers, and students in differential equations and modeling courses.         
              Instructional modules are being tested that emphasize experimentation,         
              interpreting and organizing information, problem solving, and drawing          
              logical conclusions.                                                           
                                                                                             
              The institution will contribute an amount equal to the award.
