Abstract    :
              This project's main goal is to enhance the preparation of                      
              undergraduate science majors by incorporating the use of 60-MH NMR             
              into organic, physical, analytical and research course                         
              laboratories.  The new instrument has allowed a guided systematic              
              introduction of new experiments that illustrate the principles of              
              NMR theory.  Students are provided with the theory and "hands-on"              
              experience to enable them to solve problems related to molecular               
              structure.  Undergraduate science majors have been given experience            
              in manipulation of chemical substances, have been introduced to                
              advanced, sophisticated techniques in synthesis and analysis, and              
              have been able to expand their intellectual ability to deal with               
              modern instrumental problems.                                                  
                                                                                             
              The institution contributed to this project in an amount equal to              
              the NSF funds.
