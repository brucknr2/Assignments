Abstract    :
              This award to Dr. James E. Strum, Department of Chemistry,                     
              Lehigh University, is for enhancement of the physical chemistry                
              laboratory course offered for students majoring in chemistry,                  
              biochemistry, and chemical engineering.  The project involves                  
              both curriculum development and Instrumentation for Laboratory                 
              Improvement and is supported by the Chemistry Division.  The                   
              physical chemistry laboratory curriculum would be modified to                  
              emphasize "aggregated systems", which are characterized by                     
              collective behavior of molecules or ions.  Such systems range                  
              from complex ions to macroscopic crystals and include micelles,                
              vesicles, colloids, particle suspensions, liquid crystals, and                 
              membranes. Studies of such systems have increased considerably                 
              in the past decade and inclusion of these experiments will                     
              update this course and, by extension, laboratories in physical                 
              chemistry at other universities.                                               
                                                                                             
              Five new experiments will be developed: X-ray diffraction by                   
              molecular crystals, phase transitions in liquid crystals,                      
              surface area determination, pulse photolysis, and helix-coil                   
              transition.  The instrument acquisitions supported by this                     
              award are a differential scanning calorimeter, a surface area                  
              adsorption instrument, and a pulse photolysis apparatus.
