Abstract    :
              This project supports the use of programmable logic devices in an              
              electrical engineering curriculum.  These programmable logic devices           
              (PLD) provide a low cost effective mechanism for the introduction of           
              the concepts of I.C. fabrication and design into the curriculum                
              beginning at the sophomore level.  The PLD bridges the gap between             
              discrete logic devices and the microprocessor.  As the student moves           
              through the educational program, projects of increasing complexity lead        
              to the final industry-sponsored senior project.  All are made more             
              meaningful through the use of PLD.                                             
                                                                                             
              The award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal               
              investigator's institution.
