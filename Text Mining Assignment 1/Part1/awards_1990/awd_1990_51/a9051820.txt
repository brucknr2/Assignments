Abstract    :
              This project is modernizing and expanding the laboratory component             
              of an introductory course, Physics of Light and Color.  This course            
              is designed to provide both a quantitative and qualitative                     
              understanding of light, color and visual phenomena to students whose           
              chosen professions make extensive use of these concepts and                    
              techniques.  Such professions as graphic arts, fine art, photography,          
              science education and others increasingly require knowledge of                 
              diverse optical processes and phenomena as computer generated                  
              additive color mixing and holography.  This project permits                    
              acquisition of modern spectrophotometers with reflectance                      
              accessories.  Two color graphics processors are being used for                 
              generating up to 256 colors.  Five holography kits allow creation              
              and examination of holographic images.  Using such equipment students          
              obtain hands-on experience and develop a deeper understanding of the           
              scientific and technological aspects of color processes and                    
              holography.  This understanding and appreciation are enhanced by the           
              use of up-to-date, easy to use, reliable instrumentation.  The                 
              University is matching the award with an equal amount of funds.
