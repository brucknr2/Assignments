Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry will purchase a HE Ne laser for use                
              in the undergraduate laboratory.  A laboratory course in laser                 
              spectroscopy for undergraduate junior and senior science majors                
              will be developed.  The goal of this course is to give students                
              the opportunity to study a special topic in more detail than is                
              possible in their science courses and, at the same time, to                    
              provide an enjoyable laboratory experience.  The course is                     
              divided into three sections.  The first section will involve                   
              the use of a He Ne laser with a collection of optical                          
              components to study the properties of laser light.  Also, the                  
              chemical processes of lasing action will be explained.  In the                 
              second section, students will explore the uses of two types of                 
              laser spectrometers, a continuous-wave system using an argon                   
              ion laser source and a pulsed system using a nitrogen-pumped                   
              dye laser.  In the last section, students, in small groups,                    
              will be given one or two projects which will make use of the                   
              above laser systems.  The projects will involve solving a                      
              stated problem rather than following a cookbook procedure.  The                
              object of this approach is to encourage students to think                      
              creatively and to interact with other students in solving                      
              problems.
