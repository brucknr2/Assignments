Abstract    :
              This project is intended to provide a laboratory facility for                  
              undergraduate students to use existing commercial Geographical                 
              Information Systems (GIS) image processing software and to                     
              develop new methods and techniques for managing geographic data                
              and information.  The undergraduate curriculum in surveying                    
              engineering is designed to provide a broad foundation in all of                
              the major sub disciplines of surveying.  The overall theme which               
              ties the discrete threads together throughout the curriculum is                
              the collection, management, analysis, and dissemination of                     
              spatial information.  The work performed in the laboratory                     
              facility is central to this theme.
