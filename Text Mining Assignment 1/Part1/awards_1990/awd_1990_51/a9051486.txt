Abstract    :
              The emergence of optical fabrication as a viable process to produce            
              3-dimensional models and parts rapidly and economically will have              
              significant impact in several industrially important areas.                    
              Computer-designed parts can be converted overnight to plastic                  
              models which can be used to make precision tooling, verify design              
              suitability and many other functions.  Students are able to create             
              models from their CAD/CAM programs, creating the opportunity for               
              numerous laboratory projects and experiments.  This technology is              
              being introduced immediately into the undergraduate curriculum in              
              mechanical engineering, manufacturing, industrial engineering,                 
              architectural engineering and physics.  The award is being matched             
              by an equal amount from the principal investigator's institution.
