Abstract    :
              The sophomore level course in Cellular and Molecular Biology focuses on        
              the elucidation of biological concepts, the practise of general                
              investigative skills, and the development of technical skills specific         
              to this area. These objectives are enhanced by exposing the students to        
              a greater variety of investigative techniques through hands-on                 
              experience emphasizing inquiry and experimentation. Through the                
              purchase of centrfuges, liquid chromatography and gel electrophoresis          
              systems, spectrophotometers, and fluorescence/phase microscopes with           
              video components, students can isolate, purify, and characterize               
              cellular organelles and their constituent proteins and nucleic acids.          
              This should greatly enhance the interest of the students in further            
              study in this curricular area. The college will contribute an amount           
              equal to the award.
