Abstract    :
                   This project implements a laboratory for use in two courses,              
              Electro-Optical Engineering" and "Fiber Optic Devices and                      
              Applications."  Students perform eight required experiments in                 
              each course.  Experiments involving helium neon lasers,                        
              diffraction, polarization and modulation of light, and holography              
              and spatial filtering are performed in Electro-Optical Engi-                   
              neering.  Experiments in Fiber Optic Devices and Applications                  
              focus on components, such as optical fibers, diode lasers and                  
              photo detectors, and their applications in optical communication               
              systems and sensors.  Optical benches, lasers, fiber optic kits                
              and basic measuring equipment such as power meters and an optical              
              time domain reflectometer provide senior level undergraduates                  
              with "hands-on" experience in Optical Engineering and Design.                  
                                                                                             
                   The award is being matched with a greater amount (102                     
              percent) by the principal investigator's institution.
