Abstract    :
              Equipment is acquired to introduce computer aided data                         
              acquisition into undergraduate electrical engineering                          
              laboratories.  Computer aided data acquisition will be introduced              
              in a way that students are not "distanced" form the hands-on                   
              laboratory experience.  That is, existing laboratory equipment                 
              will be used to set up experiments and observe initial results;                
              the computer aided data acquisition will be introduced as the                  
              last step to replace manual point-by-point data collection or                  
              copying oscilloscope traces.  This approach has several                        
              advantages:  students are better exposed to current engineering                
              practice; data is acquired in a form suitable for analysis and                 
              presentation using computer tools; and laboratory efficiency is                
              increased.  The choice of laptop computers and constructed data                
              acquisition modules is based on the following criteria:  1) The                
              data acquisition units are easily transportable - thus a few                   
              units may serve several laboratories.  2) Cost effectiveness,                  
              because few unites can serve several laboratories.  3) The small               
              footprint conserves bench space and 4) The capabilities of the                 
              constructed data acquisition modules can be matched to the                     
              demands of undergraduate laboratories.
