Abstract    :
              This project improves an existing geotechnical laboratory by adding            
              soil characterization instrumentation having computer interfaced data          
              acquisition.  These instruments are used to measure permeability,              
              compressibility and shear strength.  The equipment acquired includes           
              triaxial testing units with pore pressure and volume change measuring          
              apparatus, consolidometers, permeameters, and data acquisition                 
              computers and software.                                                        
                                                                                             
              This project permits the addition of a required laboratory to improve          
              the teaching of geotechnical engineering.  The laboratory introduces           
              recent development in theory, practice, and methods of testing.  The           
              addition of this apparatus permits a unified approach to theory and            
              practice while promoting the understanding of basic concepts and               
              enhancing the utility and creativity of graduates.                             
                                                                                             
              The award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal               
              investigator's institution.
