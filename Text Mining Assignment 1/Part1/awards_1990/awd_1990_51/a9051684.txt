Abstract    :
              The acquisition, setup, and incorporation of a computer-                       
              controlled viscometer system and a laboratory filter press system              
              into ceramic engineering curriculum is supported.  This equipment              
              represents a significant modernization of available                            
              instrumentation to support the teaching of ceramic processing of               
              fine particle systems.                                                         
                                                                                             
              Most ceramic manufacturing deals with the processing of powder                 
              raw materials.  The ability to control these processed depends                 
              upon the engineer's understanding of the governing cause-and-                  
              effect relationships.  Although such processes have been in use                
              for many year, many details of these relationships are only just               
              becoming clear as computers and computer modelling techniques are              
              applied to these processing phenomena.                                         
                                                                                             
              The implementation of this equipment will allow the effects of                 
              particle size distribution and surface chemistry on the viscous                
              properties of ceramic ware, to taught, graphically demonstrated,               
              and studied in depth.  These principles form the very basis for                
              the successful processing of all ceramic -- traditional ceramics               
              such as porcelains, electronic ceramics including the new                      
              superconducting oxides, and structural ceramics.
