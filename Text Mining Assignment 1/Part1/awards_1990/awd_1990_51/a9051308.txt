Abstract    :
              Fundamental to all linguistic analysis is the actual phonetic data of          
              the spoken language. With the advent of the sound spectrograph and             
              "visible speech", "ear phonetics" has become a thing of the past; the          
              quantification of pitch, timbre, amplitude, and their variation over           
              time is made possible by a variety of devices, some of which can also          
              be employed to synthesize a speech signal. Undergraduates in                   
              linguistics need to acquire a facility with such devices, beginning            
              with their earliest attempts to collect and interpret linguistic data.         
              Core courses in which use of a speech analyzer will be heavy include           
              elementary and acoustic phonetics, sociolinguistics, phonology, and            
              linguistic field methods. In addition, the P.I. will be working with           
              students on research in the analysis of how speakers of various                
              languages encode sarcasm through intonational and other sub-phonemic           
              means; the relative accessability and intrinsic interest of the project        
              provide a unique and nearly ideal entry for the investigation of some          
              fundamental issues, where relative novices can be expected to make             
              original contributions to knowledge. The college will contribute an            
              amount equal to the award.
