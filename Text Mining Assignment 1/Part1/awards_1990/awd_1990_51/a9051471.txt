Abstract    :
              Data measuring and collection techniques presently used in the                 
              Materials Science Teaching Laboratory are replaced by a modern                 
              microcomputer driven system.  The nucleus of the system consists               
              of three microcomputers which will collect, handle and display                 
              experimental date on-line.  Labview software will be purchased.                
              This software permits the configuration of an unlimited variety                
              of "virtual instruments" which can be configured to measure,                   
              record, indicate, graph or control any desired experimental                    
              parameters.  Many of the current experiments will require modest               
              equipment modifications in order to generate digital rather than               
              analog output.  The computers will allow many groups to work                   
              simultaneously.  In addition to computerizing the collection of                
              traditional mechanical property data it is proposed to do the                  
              same for much of the microstructural data which is also a vital                
              part of materials science.  This modernization will more                       
              accurately reflect the challenging and dynamic nature of                       
              materials science today.
