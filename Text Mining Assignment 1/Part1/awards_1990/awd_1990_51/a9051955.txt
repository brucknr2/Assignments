Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Through this project, the chemistry department provided its                    
              students with an FT-NMR to augment and revamp the laboratories in              
              biochemistry, inorganic, organic, and Integrated Laboratory.  A                
              cobalt-complex-synthesis laboratory for freshmen includes use of               
              the FT-NMR.  Applications include the use of multinuclear spectra              
              (C-13, P-31, and N-15 and H-1), variable temperature (kinetics                 
              and thermodynamics measurements), proton decoupling (heterocyclic              
              compounds) and two-dimensional NMR (organic and inorganic as well              
              as student research project in biochemistry).  The four full-time              
              and two part-time faculty had all had experience with one or more              
              of the capabilities mentioned and provided hands-on usage for                  
              their students in laboratory and directed research.  The net                   
              effect of the acquisition of the instrumentation has been an                   
              enhanced laboratory experience and an opportunity for faculty to               
              be renewed through new laboratory experiments and techniques, as               
              a whole group, thus forging new links among the faculty and                    
              strengthening mutual support and curricular planning.                          
                                                                                             
              The institution contributed to the project in an amount equal to               
              the NSF funds.
