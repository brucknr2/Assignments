Abstract    :
              New IBM PS/2 computers are being acquired to be used primarily in              
              three undergraduate courses. The first course is an introductory               
              course in atmospheric science and includes a three hour laboratory each        
              week. It draws large numbers of non-technical students. The other two          
              courses are advanced courses in climatology and meteorology, each              
              requiring mathematical skills at the calculus level. The computers             
              execute the PC-McIDAS software that has been developed under the               
              Unidata program and sponsored by NSF. The software takes in a wide             
              variety of real-time weather data, including satellite images, radar           
              information, conventional meteorological data and forecast information.        
              The PC-McIDAS is used extensively in the introductory course's                 
              laboratory sessions to exemplify a broad class of weather phenomena,           
              and is also available for student special projects. In addition, other         
              software will be adapted and written for the introductory and the              
              advanced courses that will assist students in 1. developing                    
              mathematical skills, 2. understanding scientific notation, and 3.              
              understanding a variety of physical problems by using simple models on         
              the computers. The university will contribute an amount equal to the           
              award.
