Abstract    :
              Laboratory experiments in physiology are being integrated into several         
              courses for biology majors and two introductory courses for non-majors.        
              The equipment includes physiology work stations with Mac Lab data              
              acquisition systems and Macintosh computers. This equipment allows             
              students to perform a wide range of active, hands-on, experiments using        
              living tissues and the human body. The exercises improve the quality of        
              instruction and student experiences in the affected courses, leading to        
              overall advancement of the Biology curriculum and core curriculum of           
              the institution. The students who benefit from this experience include         
              majors who plan to teach biology at the secondary school level, those          
              going on to graduate or professional school, and non-majors taking             
              entry level biology courses. The university will contribute an amount          
              equal to the award.
