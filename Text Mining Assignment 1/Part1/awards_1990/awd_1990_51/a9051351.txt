Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This laboratory course is offered in conjunction with the Applied              
              Polymer Science program in the Department of Food Science and                  
              Textile, Design and Consumer Economics.  The course is designed                
              to provide a basic polymer knowledge for undergraduate students                
              in chemistry, textile science, food science, packaging science                 
              and technology, art and textile conservation, polymer composite                
              studies, and engineering.  It will also satisfy the needs of                   
              continuing education students.  Examples of laboratory                         
              experiences include spectroscopic identification, branching and                
              cross-linking, rheology, transport properties, strength                        
              properties,polymer molecular weight, crystallinity, thermal                    
              properties, polyelectrolytes and electrostatics.
