Abstract    :
              A laboratory of Next workstations is shared by mathematics and                 
              computer science students for their comprehensive projects in                  
              differential equations and in computer science.  The computer is               
              an essential research tool in differential equations and enables               
              significant research experiences by undergraduates.  The networked             
              multitasking workstation environment provides both the tools and               
              a laboratory for significant computer science projects.  The                   
              grantee provides funds for this project that are an equal match                
              for the NSF award.
