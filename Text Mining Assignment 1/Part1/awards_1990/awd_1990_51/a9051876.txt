Abstract    :
              The Cell Physiology course is being upgraded through the acquisition of        
              increased centrifuge capability. The centrifuge is also being used to          
              improve the Genetics and Biochemistry courses. A Sorvall Superspeed            
              centrifuge and an additional rotor for the college's current IEC               
              centrifuge are enabling students in the Cell Physiology laboratory to          
              perform experiments requiring cell fractions,  to perform more                 
              effectively experiments which used to be done poorly, and to be more           
              efficient in the use of time in the laboratory. New laboratory projects        
              are being introduced requiring the high speed centrifuge. These                
              included experiments involving separation of mitochondria, study of            
              mitrochondrial enzymes, and analysis of enzymes in the post-                   
              mitochondrial fraction. The college will contribute an amount equal to         
              the award.
