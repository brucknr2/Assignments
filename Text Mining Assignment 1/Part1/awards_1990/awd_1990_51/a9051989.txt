Abstract    :
              A revitalized calculus curriculum is being implemented in a                    
              laboratory equipped with IBM PS/2 computers running MicroCalc.  The            
              graphing and numerical capabilities enable students to experiment              
              and to improve their intuition and understanding of concepts.  The             
              institution will contribute an amount equal to the award.//
