Abstract    :
              The Biology and Sports Medicine deaprtments are purchasing a                   
              Prospector Physiologic Analyzer in order to upgrade the respiratory and        
              cardiac physiology laboratories in Exercise Physiology, Animal                 
              Physiology, and Human Anatomy and Physiology. Laboratories in which            
              oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production will be measured have         
              been designed. Students in Exercise Physiology measure their metabolic         
              responses to different levels of exercise, including maximum aerobic           
              capacity, respiratory quotient, and onset of blood lactate                     
              accumulation. In the physiology course students can measure breath gas         
              exchange and end tidal pO2 and pCO2. This equipment will also be               
              available for senior research projects. This equipment gives students a        
              greater level of sophistication, the opportunity to conduct                    
              physiological research projects, and to utilize computer interfacing           
              and data analysis. The college will contribute an amount equal to the          
              award.
