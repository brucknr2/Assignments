Abstract    :
              The Computer Graphics course is a recent addition to the curriculum            
              of the Mathematics and Computer Science Department.  Together with             
              Compiler Construction and Artificial Intelligence courses, these               
              three provide upper division electives in the field of computer                
              science for undergraduate majors. The primary purpose of this                  
              project is to augment this new Computer Graphics course by                     
              providing majors with the necessary graphics capability to                     
              adequately study the topic and work with state-of-the-art                      
              equipment.  In addition, the enhancements to the Microcomputer                 
              Laboratory will benefit other areas within the university.  In                 
              particular the mathematics program will add educational software               
              for its upper division courses in Complex Variables and                        
              Optimization Theory; and, the aviation program, which serves 350               
              students, will be able to take advantage of appropriate CAD/CAM                
              software. The award is being matched by an equal amount from the               
              principal investigator's institution.
