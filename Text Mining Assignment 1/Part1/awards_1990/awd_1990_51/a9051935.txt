Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to the Department of Biological Sciences             
              at Florida State University to help purchase equipment for the                 
              establishment of a computer laboratory which will teach                        
              undergraduates quantitative analyses and computer literacy skills.             
              The integration of quantitative exercises using these computers in             
              undergraduate courses is a major goal of this project.  Three                  
              preliminary computer exercises have been developed that integrate              
              quantitative analyses with biological phenomena.  These exercises              
              focus on the global problem of biodiversity and then use the                   
              quantitative skills from that exercise to examine problems in                  
              relative growth and the size and shape of animals.  These exercises            
              will be expanded and additional exercises will be developed.  The              
              new laboratory will serve more than 1000 undergraduate biology                 
              majors as well as the more than 100 students in the new                        
              interdisciplinary major in Secondary/Science/Mathematics teaching.             
              Faculty in the department believe that computers should be a tool              
              used for the acquisition of basic knowledge in undergraduate                   
              biology in the same way that they are used to acquire new knowledge            
              in research.  The new laboratory and exercises will move toward                
              this goal.  The department will provide complete maintenance                   
              thorough its two electrical engineers, and supervision and                     
              installation will be provided by a full-time computer specialist               
              assigned to this laboratory.  The grantee is matching this award               
              with non-Federal sources.
