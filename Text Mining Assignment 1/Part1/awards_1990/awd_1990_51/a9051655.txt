Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Funds are requested to develop an improved instrument-based               
              undergraduate field course in Oceanography.  This is the final                 
              course taken by Oceanography undergraduates and is designed to                 
              complement their formal classroom training with an exposure to                 
              state-of-the-art methods for sample collection, analysis, and                  
              data interpretation.                                                           
                                                                                             
                   Oceanography 460 is an undergraduate field course designed                
              to develop skills in oceanography research.  Course activities                 
              include the establishment of objectives and the planning of a                  
              scientific field experiment, preparation of necessary equipment,               
              collection of data from an oceanographic research vessel, and                  
              data analysis and interpretation techniques.  Scientific results               
              are presented both orally and in written form.                                 
                                                                                             
                   Over the past five years, the numbers of students in our                  
              undergraduate program have increased by more than 25% thus                     
              increasing the requirements for equipment, instructional                       
              personnel, and ship time.  The course is also interdisciplinary,               
              demanding modern equipment for concurrent projects in biological,              
              chemical, geological and physical aspects of oceanography in                   
              which students interact and execute a cooperative field program.               
                                                                                             
                   State-of-the-art sampling equipment and analytical                        
              instrumentation are critically necessary to make OCEAN 460 a                   
              rewarding educational experience for our undergraduate students.               
              This enclosed request for equipment would greatly enhance and                  
              improve this expanding course and provide more opportunities for               
              upper division student research.
