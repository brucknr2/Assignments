Abstract    :
              Equipment, including electrophoresis equipment, ultracentrifuge rotor,         
              incubator, shaker, microfuges, micropipettors, and a vacuum centrifuge,        
              has been purchased to support a new course in molecular biology for 16         
              students. The course is based on a problem-solving original research           
              approach that is intended to motivate students and develop their               
              research skills within molecular biology. The equipment is essential           
              for student learning and faculty-student mentoring to take place. The          
              equipment also permits development of new lab exercises to be added to         
              Genetics, Cell Biology, Microbiology, Biochemistry, and senior research        
              courses. The university will contribute an amount equal to the award.
