Abstract    :
              This project establishes a computer information analysis                       
              laboratory in support of upper-division courses in software                    
              engineering, information analysis, and decision support systems -              
                                                                                             
              expert systems.  Students are exposed to automated analysis tools              
                                                                                             
              and learn project management by working in teams on real - world               
                                                                                             
              assignments.  The CASE technology provides a workbench for the                 
              planning and design of systems through the use of structured                   
              techniques.  This permits the student to develop systems complete              
                                                                                             
              with totally machine-readable documentation that are integrated and            
                                                                                             
              can be easily modified.  The award is being matched by an equal                
                                                                                             
              amount from the principal investigator's institution.
