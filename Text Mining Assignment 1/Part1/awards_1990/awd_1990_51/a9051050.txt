Abstract    :
                   This project will introduce the use of digital storage                    
              oscilloscopes in undergraduate laboratories, for the                           
              recording, storing, and processing of data.  The new equipment                 
              can be used with a variety of experiments.  Its use will help                  
              train students in new techniques, and allow the introduction                   
              of new experiments.  NSF support is recommended.
