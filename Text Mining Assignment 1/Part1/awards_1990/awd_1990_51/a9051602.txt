Abstract    :
                   This project establishes a Computer-Integrated Electronics                
              laboratory for undergraduate instruction.  The laboratory is                   
              composed of ten workstations, each containing an IEEE-488                      
              networked digital oscilloscope, arbitrary waveform generator,                  
              digital multimeter, and a 386-based PC equipped with math co-                  
              processor, VGA graphics, 80 MB hard disk hardware and SPICE                    
              simulation, scientific graphing, schematic and printed circuit                 
              layout design, data management and wordprocessor software.                     
                                                                                             
                   This laboratory provides the medium for the integration of                
              computers and computer technology into the instruction of                      
              Electronics.  The measurement equipment, computers, and software               
              constitute a complete workstation environment allowing computer                
              controlled automatic testing and measurement of electronic                     
              circuits and systems, data/signal acquisition, data/signal                     
              processing, circuit design, schematics drawing, printed circuit                
              design and layout, and electronic circuit simulation.  This                    
              laboratory simultaneously meets the needs of introductory and                  
              advanced electronics courses, exposes the student to modern                    
              computer interfaced instrumentation and computer aided circuit                 
              design, and provides on-site simulation and data/signal                        
              processing tools.  It also provides an integrated environment                  
              for undergraduate research and design projects.                                
                                                                                             
                   The award is being matched with a greater, 158%, amount by                
              the principal investigator's institution.
