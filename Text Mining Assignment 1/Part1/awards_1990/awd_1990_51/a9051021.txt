Abstract    :
              This project enables undergraduate computer engineering and                    
              electrical engineering students to perform far more realistically              
              scaled digital control systems experiments.  Using TMS-320 Digital             
              Signal Processing (DSP) workstations makes it possible to practice             
              the design of digital control of very wide bandwidth dc servo                  
              systems utilizing high sampling rates.  This is crucial to the                 
              experimental study of sophisticated control systems.  The TMS-320              
              hardware will be utilized for control system implementation as well            
              as for senior projects.                                                        
                                                                                             
              The award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal               
              investigator's institution.
