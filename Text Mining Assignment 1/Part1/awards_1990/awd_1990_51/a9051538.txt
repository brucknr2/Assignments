Abstract    :
              A modern approach to laboratory instruction in physiology is being             
              implemented using computers to interface with scientific                       
              instrumentation. The new laboratory consists of five computer                  
              workstations serving as the primary laboratory tool for groups of              
              3-5 students. The computer at each station is equipped with a                  
              complete data acquisition center by interfacing either with                    
              mechanical devices such as strain gauges for muscle contraction,               
              nerve chambers for nervous impulse monitoring, or transducers for              
              monitoring EKG, oxygen, temperature, and pH. The computer also                 
              controls a spectrophotometer for monitoring colorimetric reactions             
              for hemoglobin and enzyme analysis. These workstations supersede               
              polygraphs and oscilloscopes which needed upgrading. The                       
              workstations should thoroughly familiarize students with computer              
              technology while allowing the use of state-of-the-art                          
              instrumentation and computerized data acquisition and analysis.                
              They are utilized by several different physiology classes, and                 
              provide instrumentation for students pursuing independent study                
              projects. The university is contributing an amount equal to the                
              award.
