Abstract    :
              This project aims to give the students a well-grounded education               
              in the rapidly-changing field of neurobiology. By carrying out                 
              laboratory exercises that illustrate techniques involved in                    
              measurement of electrical potentials from excitable cells the ideas            
              learned in lecture can be reinforced and developed further. Hands-             
              on experience makes understanding of the difficult biophysical                 
              concepts and principles underlying neural function more accessible.            
              Each of the 6 set-ups that are being purchased consists of a                   
              MacIntosh SE computer with ancillary MacLab hardware (allowing the             
              computer to be used as an oscilloscope or chart recorder), a                   
              voltage follower, preamplifier, two micromanipulators, and a                   
              stereomicroscope on a boom stand. In addition, highly interactive              
              saftware reproducing intracellular recordings of voltage and                   
              current are used to challenge students' understanding of action                
              potentials. The project expands and strengthens the curriculum, and            
              prepares the students for further study of neurobiology. The                   
              college will contribute an amount equal to the award.
