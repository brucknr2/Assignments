Abstract    :
              This two-year college emphasizes laboratory based learning and use of          
              high technology equipment. This project upgrades their ability to              
              expose students to the principles of biology and the use of laboratory         
              data to explore these principles. Through the acquisition of a                 
              fluorescent microscope with phase contrast options, a high resolution          
              video camera, a video pointer, two TV monitors and a VCR, they can             
              produce edited videotapes of specimens and ongoing processes that could        
              otherwise be seen by a limited number of students. The equipment allows        
              increased use of fluorescent antibody procedures and increased viewing         
              of microscopic events by students. They can also use the videotapes in         
              a number of additional courses, and make them available to other               
              campuses. The institution is contributing 102% of the NSF award.
