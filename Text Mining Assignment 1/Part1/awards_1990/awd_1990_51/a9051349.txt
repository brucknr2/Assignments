Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project has been designed to significantly improve the                    
              chemistry curriculum at Snow College in both the classroom and                 
              the laboratory.  The project provides students with hands-on                   
              experience with a state-of-the-art Fourier transform infrared                  
              spectrometer.  The FTIR instrumentation and associated software                
              also provide students with an introduction to computer-assisted                
              data collection and manipulation and spectral database searching.              
              The spectral database is also used in the classroom to better                  
              teach the relationship between structure and spectral                          
              characteristics.  This instrumentation allows Organic Chemistry                
              students to identify unknowns, follow reaction progress, identify              
              products, and help establish purity of synthesized compounds.                  
              Freshman Chemistry students use the instrument to identify                     
              functional groups and common polymers in their laboratory                      
              introduction to Organic Chemistry.  The instrument and associated              
              software are also used to develop scientific interest and                      
              curiosity in Introductory Chemistry students and outstanding high              
              school students and teachers in the area.                                      
                                                                                             
              The institution contributed to the project in an amount equal to               
              the NSF funds.
