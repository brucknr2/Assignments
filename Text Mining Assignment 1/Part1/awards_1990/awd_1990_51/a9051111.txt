Abstract    :
                   This project establishes a network of laboratories that                   
              give undergraduate students a state-of-the art environment                     
              with many languages and development tools for practice in                      
              solving real world problems.  The goal is to give students                     
              the broad education they will need in intelligent systems                      
              design and development.  The laboratory provides modern                        
              workstations that meet the needs of students in courses that                   
              involve expert systems and AI programming.  Software                           
              products, NEXPERT Object, Goldworks II, and LEVEL5 are to be                   
              installed to support in-class exercises and prototyping                        
              projects.  Students will study theoretical models of                           
              knowledge representation, practice capturing knowledge from                    
              experts, design and implement expert systems, and analyze                      
              alternative development tools.                                                 
                   This laboratory will provide undergraduates with a                        
              hands-on research experience in a state-of-the-art artificial                  
              intelligence environment.  It is significant because it will                   
              provide students with a broad education in the rapidly                         
              developing area of intelligent systems design.
