Abstract    :
              This project utilizes eight, four channel, wide bandwidth, digital             
              oscilloscopes to strengthen the digital and microprocessor                     
              laboratories.  This equipment allows students to perform new                   
              experiments with greater ease and accuracy.                                    
                                                                                             
              Freshman students gain an appreciation for the automatic setup                 
              measurement mode aa well as the digital readout of significant                 
              quantities without the need for manual calibrations and                        
              calculations.   This enhances motivation, retention, and learning.             
              Other students are able to perform experiments and demonstrate                 
              important principles that could not previously be accomplished.                
                                                                                             
              The award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal               
              investigator's institution.
