Abstract    :
              Computing technology offers the science disciplines the opportunity to         
              extend laboratory experiences to all areas of their curriculum. In             
              economics, one or two courses in econometrics, set apart from the              
              theory courses, serve this purpose. Students are presented with                
              statistical theory and are then asked to reinforce the theory by               
              practising statistical and computing techniques. They are so involved          
              with connecting the statistical theory to the techniques that they             
              seldom make the further connection to the economic theory presented in         
              other classes. An economics computing laboratory is being set up at            
              Macalester College to unite the practise and theory of econometrics,           
              and serve as a model for other economic theory courses. This facility,         
              equipped with a network of Macintosh computers, enables students to            
              focus on the interpretation of the econometric study. Instead of               
              concentrating on computing skills and statistical techniques, students         
              can participate in research projects using facilities in the lab as            
              well as through the campus network. The college will contribute an             
              amount equal to the award.
