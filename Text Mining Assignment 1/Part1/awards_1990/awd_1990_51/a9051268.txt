Abstract    :
              The touchstone of a Manufacturing Systems Engineering curriculum is the        
              synergistic integration of materials design, mechanical design, and            
              manufacturing processing system design.  The function of this project          
              is to support the development of a Design for Manufacturability and            
              Assemblability Studio (DFMA) for the practicum sessions in the course,         
              Design for Manufacture.  The DFMA Studio achieves 3 functions:  (1)            
              Design for Manufacture and Assembly Analysis;  (2) Evaluation of               
              Handling and Orientation, and (3) Assembly/Disassembly Evaluation.  Six        
              Zenith ZSF-285-25 personal computer stations equipped with Boothroyd           
              Dewhurst Design for Assembly Toolkit software and Design for                   
              Manufacture Toolkit software comprises the DFMA Analysis Studio.  Four         
              POSI-I mechanically programmable vibratory bowl feeders with                   
              Programmable Silhouette Recognizer evaluate the orientability and              
              feedability of a part as a function of component form.  American               
              Company System R Modular Workstations with hand tools and pneumatic            
              tools constitute a facility for assembly/disassembly evaluation.  This         
              DFMA Studio provides the undergraduate engineering student with the            
              practical evaluation of product design for manufacture.                        
                                                                                             
              The award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal               
              investigator's institution.
