Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This laboratory program for advanced undergraduates is designed                
              to provide students with a sound understanding of basic concepts               
              of modern physics and to teach them to use new techniques                      
              complementing the physics they learn. Experiments include thin                 
              film growth and characterization, surface science, electronic and              
              magnetic properties of metals and semiconductors, and nanometer                
              scale measurements.  Proficiency in one of these areas resulting               
              in publishable results is encouraged.
