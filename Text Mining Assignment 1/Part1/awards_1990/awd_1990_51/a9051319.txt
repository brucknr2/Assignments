Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Advanced undergraduate student training in astronomy will be                   
              carried out by providing students with real research experience                
              using a large modern observatory equipped with research-quality                
              instrumentation.  A laboratory and analysis environment will be                
              provided for specific astronomy undergraduate course offerings at              
              the University of Washington.  This environment will allow students            
              to acquire scientific data and will provide them with the tools to             
              evaluate this data using current astronomical techniques.  The                 
              goals of this program are to attract undergraduate students to                 
              astronomy and space science fields and to encourage them in                    
              developing their investigative talents.                                        
                                                                                             
              The program intends to create this environment and efficiently                 
              achieve these goals by taking advantage of many standards from                 
              industry as well as implementing standard astronomical data                    
              acquisition and analysis tools.  Many of these standards exist as              
              the successful products of past and continuing programs supported              
              by the National Science Foundation.                                            
                                                                                             
              The staff and observatory facilities of the University of                      
              Washington, which has a broad coverage in scientific, instructional            
              and engineering support, form an ideal platform upon which to base             
              the program.
