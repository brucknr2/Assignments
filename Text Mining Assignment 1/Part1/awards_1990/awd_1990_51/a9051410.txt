Abstract    :
              This computer numerical control curriculum development project is              
              centered around the qualitative improvement and expansion of a                 
              comprehensive undergraduate curriculum through the integration of              
              classroom and laboratory instruction.  Essential to this                       
              undertaking are state-of-the-art computer numerical control                    
              workstations that are used in conjunction with previously existing             
              lathe and milling machines.  This equipment permits students to                
              experience the practical application of theories presented in the              
              classroom.  Principles of numerical control are now taken from                 
              concept to final product while exploring the mathematical                      
              foundations underlying the control and machining processes.  In                
              this way principles and technological applications are combined to             
              strengthen the students understanding of automated machining for               
              improved production methods, parts quality and safety.                         
                                                                                             
              The award is being matched with a greater amount (132 percent) by              
              the principal investigator's institution.
