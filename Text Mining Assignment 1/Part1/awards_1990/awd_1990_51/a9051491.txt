Abstract    :
              Wesleyan will initiate a new undergraduate program, Neuroscience               
              & Behavior in 1990/91.  Two of the three new courses for the                   
              program are the focus of this project.  The program is research                
              oriented and a key goal is to have virtually all of the 20-25                  
              senior majors involved in independent research projects.  As                   
              preparation, sophomores will take a laboratory course wither in                
              submammalian neurophysiology or in mammalian behavioral                        
              neurobiology.  We propose to obtain modern data acquisition,                   
              storage and analysis equipment for the behavioral neurobiology                 
              laboratory course.  The equipment will also provide demonstrations             
              in the introductory survey course, and make possible independent               
              research for advanced majors.  The equipment includes recording                
              modules, an electrical stimulator, a video system, a computer                  
              workstation for analyzing physiological and behavioral data, and               
              an optical disk system for mass storage.  Experiments with animals             
              will involve the chemical and electrical initiation of locomotion,             
              and single neuron activity associated with head movement, spatial              
              cognition, and memory.  Experiments with human subjects will                   
              involve the preparation for locomotion, the generation of eye                  
              movements, and EEG and cardiac changes during learning.  Each year             
              the project will directly improve the training of 20 students in               
              the laboratory course and independent projects and benefit another             
              30 students through the demonstrations in the introductory course.
