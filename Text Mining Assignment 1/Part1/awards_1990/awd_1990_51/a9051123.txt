Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project concerns the incorporation of a high field, Fourier               
              Transform nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer for the                      
              improvement of undergraduate laboratory instruction and research.              
              The instrument is being used heavily in sophomore organic                      
              chemistry for acquiring spectra in conjunction with organic                    
              synthesis and product identification.  NMR spectroscopy is also                
              an important component of the following junior and senior level                
              laboratory courses:  physical chemistry, instrumental analysis,                
              advanced inorganic chemistry, biochemistry, and organic                        
              spectroscopy.  Advanced applications such as the inversion-                    
              recovery pulse sequence, variable temperature line-shape                       
              analysis, the nuclear Overhauser effect, and various 2-D                       
              spectroscopy techniques have been introduced.  The NMR is also                 
              being used in numerous faculty sponsored undergraduate research                
              projects.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              The institution has contributed to this project an amount                      
              exceeding the NSF funds by approximately 11%.
