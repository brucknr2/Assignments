Abstract    :
              The improvement of the computer-integrated manufacturing (CIM)                 
              laboratory facilities of the undergraduate engineering program at              
              the University of Missouri-Rolla is sought.  The primary goal is               
              to enrich the quality of CIM-related laboratory instruction by                 
              providing and environment to demonstrate the application of the                
              hierarchy of modeling tools used to design, analyze, and control               
              a CIM system capable of producing a wide range of complex parts                
              and assemblies.  A vision systems is secured and a 4-axis CNC                  
              milling machine with an automatic tool-changer is required.                    
              Matching university funds will be spent to acquire a workstation,              
              a programmable logic controller, and an industrial computer.                   
              These acquisitions will improve lab instruction in the areas of                
              part design and NC programming, part manufacture and process                   
              control, robotics and production management and will result in a               
              CIM lab facility which can serve as a model.  The systems                      
              enhancement will support new course offerings and enrich the                   
              content of several related undergraduate courses through the                   
              inclusion of a wide range of challenging laboratory experiments,               
              student projects and coursework assignments.
