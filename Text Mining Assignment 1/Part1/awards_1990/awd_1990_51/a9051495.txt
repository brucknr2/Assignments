Abstract    :
                   New experiments will be developed for the laboratory                      
              portion of the introductory sequence and into the junior                       
              laboratory course that are particularly relevant to students                   
              interested in physical oceanography.  These include,                           
              specifically, the use of ultrasonic waves in water to study                    
              wave properties such as refraction and diffraction and, in the                 
              junior laboratory, the study of nonlinear acoustic                             
              interactions that are important in sonar design.  These                        
              experiments will provide the students in this unique program a                 
              strong introduction to the world of physical oceanography.
