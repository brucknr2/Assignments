Abstract    :
              This project provides the equipment and software to complete the               
              Engineering Technology Senior Teaching Laboratory.  The equipment              
              acquired establishes a local-area-network of 386-based personal                
              computers with fabrication and testing hardware necessary for                  
              senior-level capstone projects in Computer and Electronics                     
              Engineering Technology.  The software features Unix operating                  
              systems (with DOS partitions), C development system, and a C-to-               
              microprocessor cross-translator in support of a microprocessor                 
              development environment for robotics and other digital control                 
              system applications.  An advanced communications facility for                  
              undergraduate research has also been established.                              
                                                                                             
              The award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal               
              investigator's institution.
