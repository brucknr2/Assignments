Abstract    :
              This project integrates microcomputers and spectrophotometers into             
              four introductory biology courses. The Spectronic 20D                          
              Spectrophotometer is utilized to construct a standard curve,                   
              determine concentrations of bacterial cultures, produce absorption             
              spectra of plant pigments, study the relationship between light                
              intensity and the rate of photosynthesis, and demonstrate enzyme               
              kinetics. The use of the computer enables the students to collect,             
              tabulate, manipulate, and graph data more accurately and                       
              effectively, leaving more time to interpret the data, perform                  
              statistical anaysies and draw conclusions. Computer-based tutorials            
              which supplement the laboratory material enable the students to                
              study laboratory techniques such as pipetting, plating                         
              microorganisms, sterile technique, weighing samples, calculating               
              Rf values, using the spectrophotometer, constructing standard                  
              curves, and calculating dilution series. Software, such as that                
              developed by Thornton and bioQUEST for problem-solving, data                   
              collection and data analysis, is being used in combination with                
              hands-on experiences. The college is contributing an amount equal              
              to the award.
