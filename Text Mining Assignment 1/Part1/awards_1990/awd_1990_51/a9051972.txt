Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to the Department of Biological Sciences             
              at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee to purchase equipment to              
              interface state-of-the-art physiological modules with computers to             
              permit interactive, multidimensional analysis of basic                         
              physiological principles in undergraduate anatomy and physiology               
              courses.  Instrumentation to be purchased includes four computer               
              interfacing units (SPI) that will interface with the physiology                
              module packages (four) containing dual-trace oscilloscopes;                    
              respiration and blood pressure modules; EKG, EEG, and force-                   
              transducer modules; strain gauge preamplifiers etc.; four IBM                  
              compatible computers, printers and appropriate mobile workstation              
              units and commercially available software for use with the                     
              interfacing equipment.  This project will make physiological data              
              acquisition, storage, retrieval and interaction more dynamic and               
              interactive than ever before possible in teaching laboratories,                
              and the experience that every undergraduate needs to be exposed to             
              in an outstanding physiology curriculum.  The grantee is matching              
              this award with non-Federal sources.
