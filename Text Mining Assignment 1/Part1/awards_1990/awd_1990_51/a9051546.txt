Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Through this project, the institution purchased an NMR to improve              
              the students' understanding of molecular structure, particularly               
              of organic compounds.  The chemistry faculty revised existing                  
              experiments to take advantage of the equipment, and they added                 
              new experiments emphasizing principles of molecular structure                  
              such as applications of NMR to biochemical kinetics and cation                 
              hydration constants by proton NMR.  Facilities for undergraduate               
              research were greatly enhanced by the acquisition.  In addition,               
              the equipment was used for the institution's "Saturday Seminar"                
              program for high school teachers and students and for junior                   
              college faculty and students in the area.                                      
                                                                                             
              The institution contributed to the project in an amount equal to               
              the NSF funds.
