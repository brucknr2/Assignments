Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to update the molecular biology                      
              instructional program at the University of Southern Mississippi by             
              establishing an intensive "hands-on" laboratory in molecular                   
              biology/biotechnology.  The laboratory in molecular biology will               
              give the students practical experience in the fundamental                      
              techniques that form the foundation of experimental molecular                  
              biology.  The major instruments to be obtained include growth                  
              chambers, electrophoresis equipment, UV spectrometers and low                  
              temperature storage units.  The grantee is matching this award with            
              non-Federal sources.
