Abstract    :
              Undergraduates at Curry College can become more  involved in                   
              research through the purchase of equipment that allows                         
              integration of the IBM-compatible PC's with the existing                       
              scientific instrumentation system. The new instrumentation                     
              upgrades the existing system, and extends the speed, range, and                
              versatility of measurements that can be made. This improvement                 
              allows students to perform sophisticated scientific experiments                
              under computer control and to gain experience with sophisticated               
              statistical analysis programs. Students, many of whom have                     
              learning disabilities, are becoming involved in research on the                
              psychophysiology of brain function and the psychophysiology of                 
              stress. Students in Experimental Psychology are becoming involved              
              in semester-long projects that enrich their understanding of                   
              scientific research and improve the quality of their preparation               
              for advanced studies in psychology. The college will contribute                
              an amount equal to the award.
