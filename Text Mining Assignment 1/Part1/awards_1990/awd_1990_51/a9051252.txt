Abstract    :
                   The upper level physics courses at Miami University will                  
              be revised to take advantage of the impact of the newly-                       
              developed courses of the Introductory University Physics                       
              Project.  The equipment supplied here is needed to teach modern                
              optics and provide a quality laboratory experience, using high                 
              quality equipment, in atomic and molecular spectroscopy for                    
              advanced majors.  The current one-semester optics course will                  
              be expanded into a two-semester lecture/laboratory offering:                   
              Laser Physics and Modern Optics followed by Atomic and                         
              Molecular Spectroscopy (with emphasis on Laser Spectroscopy).
