Abstract    :
              The addition of a state-of-the-art scanning electron microscope to             
              the equipment available for students in biology, chemistry, and                
              geology enhances the laboratory experience of students in several              
              ways: 1) an interdisciplinary course in the use of the SEM is                  
              offered, 2) other courses have been enhanced by the use of present-            
              day SEM technology, 3) help attract majors into the sciences.  The             
              grantee provides funds for this project that are an equal match for            
              the NSF award.
