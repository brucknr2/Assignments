Abstract    :
              The college is developing an undergraduate astronomy laboratory.               
              Courses in astronomy have been part of Natural Science Division                
              curriculum for the past four years.  The laboratory course made                
              possible with the grant can be taken concurrently with either                  
              Planetary or Galactic Astronomy.  It is taught at an introductory              
              level.  The equipment will be used by students learning how to use             
              a telescope, plan an observation, use the stellar coordinate system,           
              photograph celestial events and develop their own images.                      
              Furthermore, students study planetary surfaces by means of laser               
              video disc images.  The college is matching the award with an equal            
              amount of funds.
