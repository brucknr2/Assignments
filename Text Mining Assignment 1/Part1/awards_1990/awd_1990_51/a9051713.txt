Abstract    :
              As a result of a program review, the Psychology Department is                  
              increasing its commitment to the research and laboratory                       
              components of its curriculum.  It is establishing a laboratory                 
              component in the Physiological Psychology course.  This                        
              laboratory permits students to learn laboratory methods, explore               
              the relationship between biology (physiological function) and                  
              behavior, and develop their own research projects.  This                       
              opportunity was virtually non-existent previously.  The project                
              furthermore, provides students with exposure to animals as                     
              research subjects.  Exposure to humanely-treated research animals              
              provides students with a broader perspective on animal rights                  
              issues.  The university is contributing an amount equal to the                 
              award.
