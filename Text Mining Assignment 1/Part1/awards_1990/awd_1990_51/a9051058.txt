Abstract    :
              Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are sophisticated computer                
              systems for analyzing, storing and displaying diverse spatial and              
              non-spatial data. They are ideally suited for analyzing complex                
              interrelationships among natural resources and for producing                   
              outputs, including maps, used in management. This two-year campus              
              is purchasing three complete GIS units for their Wildlife                      
              Technology program. These units enhance instruction and introduce              
              students to GIS as an integral part of natural resource                        
              management. The systems allow a greater variety of data to be                  
              collected, analyzed, and mapped. Management decisions can more                 
              easily be made and their impacts compared on a variety of biotic               
              and abiotic natural resources. As GIS systems are increasingly                 
              being used in resource management agencies, this instruction                   
              makes the graduates of the program more knowledgeable about such               
              systems and therefore more competitive when they graduate. The                 
              school will contribute an amount equal to the award.
