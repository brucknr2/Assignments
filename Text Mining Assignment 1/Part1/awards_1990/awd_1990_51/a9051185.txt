Abstract    :
              Students in precalculus and calculus are working in teams in a                 
              laboratory equipped with Macintosh IIcx computers running Mathematica.         
              Mathematical concepts are clarified and reinforced by visualization,           
              more realistic problems and models are considered, and writing skills          
              and understanding of concepts are improved by the requirement of formal        
              written reports.                                                               
                                                                                             
              The institution will contribute an amount equal to the award.
