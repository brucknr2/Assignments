Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to enhance students' understanding of              
              how the scientific method is applied to psychological phenomena                
              by giving them first-hand experience with principles and methods               
              of behavioral observation.  This project fits into a larger                    
              curriculum revision in the department aimed at expanding                       
              students' exposure to research methods.  High quality videotaping              
              and computerized event recorders make possible an integrative                  
              focus on observational methods in biological, developmental,                   
              comparative, and social psychology laboratory courses.  The                    
              equipment also enhances laboratory instruction in learning,                    
              personality, and abnormal psychology.  Students mastery of                     
              observational skills will facilitate planning and implementation               
              of senior thesis research.  Furthermore, students acquire                      
              confidence and expertise in modern methods and instrumentation,                
              which better prepares them for graduate study.  The college will               
              contribute an amount equal to the award.
