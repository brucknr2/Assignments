Abstract    :
              When computers are used as a tool in teaching, rather than as the              
              major object of instruction, their use should be driven by the                 
              specific pedagogical aims of the course, and should require very               
              little instructional overhead.  This is not the case for many of               
              the software systems available for use in introductory computer                
              science and mathematics courses.  "Principles of Computer Science,"            
              a course taught on a limited basis for the first time in the Fall              
              of 1989, is designed to teach some of the foundational ideas of                
              computer science at an introductory level.  It does not teach                  
              computer programming or computer literacy.  An important part of               
              this course is a series of microcomputer experiments that are                  
              designed to illustrate principles being taught in the course while             
              requiring no class time for instruction on the programs used in the            
              laboratory.  Twenty one IBM microcomputers are necessary for the               
              full implementation of this project.  Future efforts will expand               
              and refine the scope of the material coverage.  The award is being             
              matched by an equal amount from the principal investigator's                   
              institution.
