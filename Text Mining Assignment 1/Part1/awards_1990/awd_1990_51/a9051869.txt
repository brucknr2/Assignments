Abstract    :
              This community college is purchasing equipment to conduct studies              
              on water quality of a local lake as the major focus of an                      
              Environmental Biology course and as an integral part of the                    
              curriculum in other biology and chemistry courses at the                       
              institution.  The goal of the project is to spark interest in                  
              science while teaching basic scientific knowledge and research                 
              skills.  The lake was chosen as a research focus because of its                
              declining condition, which is a concern for students and the                   
              community as a whole.  Students are developing projects to be                  
              carried out with the requested equipment in:  1. water quality                 
              studies, 2. algae studies, 3. bacterial studies, 4. environmental              
              growth studies.  The equipment includes water testing kits and                 
              sampling equipment, a spectrophotometer, video microscope system,              
              culturing equipment, and computing equipment with interface and                
              sensors.  The college will contribute an amount equal to the award.
