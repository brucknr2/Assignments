Abstract    :
                   New device simulation and layout tools and a new device                   
              fabrication process are being developed for the Caltech                        
              freshman course in solid state devices and integrated                          
              circuits, a two-quarter sequence offered annually to                           
              approximately 90 majors and non-majors.  The unusual goal                      
              of this class is to excite interest among freshman in solid                    
              state electronics in particular, and engineering in general.                   
              Hence the underlying curricular strategy is to appropriately                   
              simplify device physics to the level of intuition and simple                   
              mathematics, and to simplify the fabrication process as much                   
              as possible so as to make the first undergraduate laboratory                   
              experience very positive.  To this end, design of a software                   
              toolbox for device simulation and layout enables freshmen to                   
              better understand device operation at an intuitive level and                   
              to avoid design mistakes in device and circuit layout.  A                      
              new fabrication process centered around the use of                             
              spin-dopants will allow use of both n-type and p-type dopants                  
              with greater ease, reliability and safety.                                     
                   Device simulation and layout tools and the use of both                    
              dopant types will enable the present curriculum to be                          
              expanded to the design and fabrication of bipolar and CMOS                     
              devices while retaining the simplicity crucial for the                         
              process.  This will be a significant advance in the                            
              teaching of undergraduate courses in the design and                            
              fabrication of microelectronic devices.
