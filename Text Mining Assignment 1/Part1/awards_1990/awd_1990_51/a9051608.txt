Abstract    :
              Recent developments in cognitive psychology, computer technology,              
              software (including authoring programs), optical disc technology,              
              and "hypermedia," have the potential for creating an instructional             
              environment that is qualitatively different from the traditional one,          
              and which provides ways of overcoming some of its curricular                   
              shortcomings. This project is developing a calculus-based                      
              introductory physics course utilizing interactive multimedia--a                
              combination of text, pictures, diagrams, animations, sounds, and               
              animated and/or live-action video.  The grant provides eight                   
              interactive multimedia workstations, each consisting of a Macintosh            
              SE/30 computer and a Pioneer LD 4200 Laserdisc player.  These are              
              managed by a Macintosh IICX computer which is a file server and also           
              keeps records of student performances for use in evaluation and                
              program development.  Simulations and animations are used to help              
              develop students' intuition and understanding of physical principles.          
              Interactivity is emphasized.  Mathematical models, including                   
              numerical methods, such as used in research and industry, are being            
              developed.  The college will match the award with an equal amount of           
              funds.
