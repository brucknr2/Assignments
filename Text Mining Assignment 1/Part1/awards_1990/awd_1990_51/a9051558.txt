Abstract    :
              Several new instruments for modern microscopy are being integrated into        
              a number of courses. Two high-quality compound microscopes equipped for        
              phase contrast, differential interference contrast, fluorescence, and          
              photomicroscopy, a microtome capable of cutting thick and semi-thin            
              sections in paraffin and plastic, and a glass knifebreaker for use with        
              the microtome are being purchased. These are essential tools for the           
              practise of modern biological microscopy, and  are being integrated            
              into a variety of courses throughout the curriculum, including the             
              introductory biology sequence, eight upper division courses, and the           
              student research program. The college will contribute an amount equal          
              to the award.
