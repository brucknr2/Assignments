Abstract    :
              A plan is currently under way to restructure the internal                      
              combustion engine curriculum for Mechanical Engineering at the                 
              University of Missouri-Rolla.  The goal of the project is to                   
              modernize the course by introducing both lecture topic and                     
              laboratory experiences pertaining to current innovations and                   
              motivating factors in the engine industry including modern air                 
              and fuel induction systems, emission  formation and emission                   
              testing and requirements.  A modern spark ignition engine test                 
              facility will be developed for a state-of-the-art engine donated               
              by industry.  The test facility will be sufficiently automated to              
              allow the students to focus on the data being taken during the                 
              testing and not on the control of the engine.  The needed                      
              equipment includes a dynamometer control system, a PC base data                
              acquisition system and some engine instrumentation.  The                       
              dynamometer control system will hold the engine torque and speed               
              set points without requiring continual adjustment and provide                  
              safe, rapid change of set points.  The students will collect                   
              engine information that is crucial to current designs including                
              engine load and speed, combustion chamber pressure profiles, fuel              
              injection characteristics and exhaust emissions using the high                 
              speed data acquisition system.  It is anticipated that this                    
              project will generate more student interest in the area of                     
              internal combustion engines and produce students that are better               
              able to serve the needs of industry.
