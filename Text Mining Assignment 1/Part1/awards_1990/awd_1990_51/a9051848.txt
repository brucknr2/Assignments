Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to integrate Fourier transform                
              infrared spectroscopy into the chemistry curriculum wherever                   
              students can use it to solve chemical problems.  With the                      
              acquisition of the computer-driven FT/IR, 250 students will use                
              this modern technique in eight different courses during a five-year            
              period.  They are identifying organic and inorganic structures,                
              searching spectral databases, measuring fundamental physical                   
              constants, determining the composition of complex mixtures, and                
              conducting undergraduate research projects.  They are developing               
              analytical skills that are preparing them for graduate school or               
              careers in chemistry and related disciplines.  The institution                 
              contributed to this project in an amount equal to the NSF funds.
