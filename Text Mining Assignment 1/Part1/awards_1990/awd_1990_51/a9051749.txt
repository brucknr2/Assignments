Abstract    :
              Fifteen microcomputers and related hardware are being used to effect           
              changes in the curriculum and scientific orientation of the Department         
              of Psychology. The department is in the process of improving its               
              laboratory facilities so that major and non-major students have greater        
              exposure to the empirical techniques used to examine behavior. To this         
              end, the computers are used to allow students to perform a wide range          
              of experiments in a laboratory setting. The first priority is                  
              development of a laboratory component for the introductory level               
              course. The experiments conducted in this laboratory replicate                 
              experiments that serve as the basis for the principles being discussed         
              in lecture. The emphases of these labs is the analysis of specific             
              phenomena, the use of systematic empiricism to acquire information, and        
              the means for analyzing and reporting the results of an experiment. The        
              laboratory is also used for advanced-level classes in which students           
              perform a series of experiments specific to that field. The computer           
              facility is also available to students conducting independent research         
              projects. The college will contribute an amount equal to the award.
