Abstract    :
              The goal in restructuring Bowdoin's Modern Physics laboratory is to            
              increase active and thoughtful participation of students in the                
              laboratory experience through involvement in the design,                       
              construction, and execution of lab experiments.  The new lab                   
              experiments are designed to achieve this goal for a broad range of             
              students with differing career goals, at the level appropriate to              
              each student. This constraint has led to the choice of a lab                   
              structure with three levels of experiments, varying their degree of            
              sophistication and instrumentation.  For more efficient use of                 
              resources these experiments have been created using some common                
              equipment where possible.  The major instruments used are PC-based             
              plug-in multichannel analyzers, scintillators and scintillation                
              counters, X-ray diffractometers, photomultipliers, time-to-amplitude           
              converters, as well as germanium, silicon, and sodium-iodide                   
              detectors.  These are being used in various experiments involving              
              nuclear decay machanisms, gamma-rays, X-rays, and other decay                  
              products such as positrons or muons.  This project is a necessary              
              step in achieving the goal of providing excellent preparation for              
              those considering further graduate study, as well as cultivating and           
              encouraging students to major in physics who may follow other career           
              paths.  The college is matching the award with an equal amount of              
              funds.
