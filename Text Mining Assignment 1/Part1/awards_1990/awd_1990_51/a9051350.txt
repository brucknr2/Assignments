Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project has allowed the institution to acquire a Varian 3400              
              Gas Chromatograph to enable the sophomore level Organic-                       
              Analytical Laboratory to incorporate a strong GC/mass                          
              spectroscopy segment into the laboratory.  The instrument is used              
              with the department's Varian 3300/Finnigan MAT system.  Students               
              are first instructed on these instruments in the fall term in                  
              order to characterize unknown components separated from mixtures.              
              Students make extensive use of the instrument with the GC/MS in                
              the second term to characterize and analyze products in multistep              
              syntheses.  The need for the instrumentation was heightened by an              
              increase in enrollment in chemistry, and the physical                          
              impracticality caused by both time constraints and caution in                  
              having every student search for suitable chromatographic                       
              conditions on equipment which was in hand.                                     
                                                                                             
              The institution has contributed to the project in an amount equal              
              to the NSF funds.
