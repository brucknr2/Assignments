Abstract    :
                   A new course whose purpose is to teach scientific problem                 
              solving with microcomputers will be developed.  This course would              
              be taken by undergraduates whose intended degrees are in                       
              nontechnical areas.  The goal is to teach nonscientists the                    
              principles involved in problem solving in scientific                           
              disciplines.  The use of computers will allow the students to                  
              attack a wide range of modern and topical problems, which                      
              would otherwise be inaccessible.
