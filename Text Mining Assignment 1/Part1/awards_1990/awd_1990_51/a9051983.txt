Abstract    :
              This project develops the mechanical engineering and technology                
              materials science and failure analysis laboratories.  These                    
              laboratories are intended to improve the understanding of the                  
              fundamentals of materials science and to promote the applications of           
              materials so as to minimize failure and maximize performance.                  
              Graduates of this program will meet industries' need for engineers who         
              can design and produce high quality goods more efficiently.  New               
              courses are being developed and laboratories integrated into these as          
              well as existing areas.  The acquired equipment permits the inclusion          
              of materials specifications, fatigue and fracture analysis.  The               
              addition of the Materials Testing System permits a major upgrade of the        
              current curriculum.  The acquisition of this state-of-the-art                  
              instrument allows students to become familiar with all essential tech-         
              niques needed to design and analyze ways to prevent failures in machine        
              parts.  The award is being matched by an equal amount from the                 
              principal investigator's institution.
