Abstract    :
              The laboratory in microbial physiology, previously mundane and                 
              emphasizing the memorization of metabolic pathways and structures of           
              the bacterial cell, is being revitalized with the purchase of two              
              calorimeters, an oxygen electrode, and a spectrophotometer. The                
              calorimeters are used for teaching thermodynamics, and the oxygen              
              electrode and spectrophotometer are used for teaching enzymology.              
              Students will see that thermodynamics and enzymology can be used to            
              solve research problems in microbiology. Faculty benefit because of the        
              increased breadth and the challenge of teaching the theory and                 
              techniques. The instruments are also to be used for undergraduate              
              research projects which are an integral part of the curriculum. The            
              university will contribute an amount equal to the award.
