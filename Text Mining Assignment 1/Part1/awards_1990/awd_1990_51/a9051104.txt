Abstract    :
              This proposal will provide laboratory experiences for physics                  
              students at a community college on the concepts of continuous or               
              variable changes that can occur during particle dynamics.  Both the            
              subject matter and the laboratory techniques are not usually                   
              presented at this level, and, hence, this proposal affords an                  
              interesting opportunity to study the ability of subjects to grasp              
              this subject matter.  The instructor (P.I.) is very qualified and              
              these experiences will enhance the understanding of these concepts             
              by these students.
