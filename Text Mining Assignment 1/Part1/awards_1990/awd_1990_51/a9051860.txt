Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry will require a nitrogen laser and                  
              computer-interfaced UV/VIS spectrophotometer to improve their                  
              undergraduate education in chemistry.  The first part of this                  
              project will bring computers into the physical chemistry                       
              laboratory to give students experience in using                                
              computer-interfaced instrumentation and to reduce the time                     
              required to analyze raw data.  It is hoped this will increase                  
              the appeal of this course to prospective chemistry majors and                  
              reduce a major barrier to their completing a B.S. major in                     
              chemistry.  The combination of computers with high-resolution                  
              plotters will also allow quantitative estimation of errors to                  
              be made much more quickly and more routinely. The computers                    
              will also be used with a molecular orbital program to interpret                
              the absorption spectra of dyes and aromatic compounds and to                   
              teach the BASIC programming language.                                          
                                                                                             
              The new instrumentation will allow the introduction of three                   
              new experiments into the physical chemistry laboratory course                  
              as well as significant upgrading of several existing                           
              experiments.  The nitrogen laser will allow for measurement of                 
              fluorescence decay times in the 1 nanosecond range. Other new                  
              experiments include "The Photochemistry of NO2" and "The                       
              Statistical Thermodynamics of Iodine Sublimation."
