Abstract    :
              This project enhances the junior and senior-level Mechanical                   
              Engineering laboratory facilities to better prepare students as                
              mechanical engineers in industry, government, and academia.  The               
              goal of this project is the development of a computer-networked                
              automated data acquisition and analysis system for undergraduate               
              students.  Personal computers are linked to measurement, data                  
              acquisition and data reduction instruments via an IEEE-488 bus as              
              well as the University of Texas Center for High Performance                    
              Computing.  This networked system's capabilities allows expanded               
              coverage of traditional topics and permits the introduction of                 
              appropriate advanced measurement and signal processing techniques.             
              The efficiencies inherent in the integrated computer system enable             
              students to more productively combine analysis with design.  This              
              facilitates the traditional, iterative design process thereby                  
              allowing incorporation of optimization techniques.                             
                                                                                             
              The award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal               
              investigator's institution.
