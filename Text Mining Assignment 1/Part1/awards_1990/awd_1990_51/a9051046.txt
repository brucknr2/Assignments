Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The aim of this project is the strengthening of the undergraduate              
              science students' experience in modern instrumentation.  The                   
              college has acquired the equipment necessary to expose students                
              particularly to spectroscopy (spectrometer, sensitive balance and              
              computers and related software).  Spectroscopy has become the                  
              standard technique for determining the structure of products                   
              formed in a chemical reaction;  the students are using the                     
              equipment in organic chemistry classes.                                        
                                                                                             
              Through the equipment, the students have gained an opportunity to              
              combine the theories of spectroscopy with experimental                         
              experience, learning its diverse and powerful applications first               
              hand.  This project is particularly significant because it goes                
              beyond simply modernizing a laboratory to increasing student                   
              awareness of growing critical issues in science such as pollution              
              generated by waste chemicals, and introducing them to a cost-                  
              effective means of dealing with such issues.  Further, the                     
              instrumentation is helping the college provide quality science                 
              education to a student body which consists predominantly of women              
              (66%), educationally and economically disadvantaged individuals                
              (72%), and members of ethnic minorities (80%).  This is not only               
              enhancing their science education, but is also helping to                      
              stimulate and motivate these students towards further                          
              participation in the scientific arena.                                         
                                                                                             
              The institution has contributed to this project in an amount                   
              equal to the NSF funds.
