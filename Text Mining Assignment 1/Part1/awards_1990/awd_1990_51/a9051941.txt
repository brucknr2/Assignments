Abstract    :
              The Salish Kootenai College, a tribally controlled two-year college on         
              the Flathead Indian Reservation, is improving chemistry and natural            
              resources courses. Improvements are being made in student preparation          
              for natural resource field courses and chemistry by utilizing                  
              interactive audiovisual manuals, hand-held field computers which allow         
              for some analysis of data in the field, and PC's in the chemistry lab          
              with data acquisition interfaces which display chemical and physical           
              changes graphically as the student performs the experiment. The program        
              is especially significant because it matches state-of-the-art                  
              technologies with the learning styles of Native American students. The         
              college will contribute an amount equal to the award.
