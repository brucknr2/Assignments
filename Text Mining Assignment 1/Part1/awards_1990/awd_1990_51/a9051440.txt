Abstract    :
              This project's aim is to establish an undergraduate instrumentation            
              laboratory utilizing process control systems specifically designed             
              for educational use.  Such systems provide the student with                    
              realistic situations likely to be encountered in industry, permit              
              the student to become familiar with a variety of industrial                    
              sensors, and enable the evaluation of data for accuracy and control            
              of industrial processes.  The equipment obtained under this grant              
              is a proven, integrated laboratory set-up including sensors for                
              parameters most commonly measured in industry and a controller for             
              a variety of experiments.  It provides the laboratory experience               
              necessary for the understanding of process control by computer.                
              This knowledge is useful in the many industries such as chemical               
              plants, refineries, power plants, food technology and                          
              pharmaceuticals where graduates frequently function as technical               
              and supervisory personnel.  An accompanying textbook is available.             
              The award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal               
              investigator's institution.
