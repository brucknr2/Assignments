Abstract    :
              This proposal seeks funds to purchase new and modern equipment for             
              their ten year old, largely home built equipment, laboratory.  Such            
              equipment will better prepare their majors in the use of modern                
              experimental technique for their senior research and for graduate              
              school and industry.
