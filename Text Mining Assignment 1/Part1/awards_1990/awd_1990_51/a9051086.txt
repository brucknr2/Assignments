Abstract    :
              Computer-based data acquisition and processing instruments are being           
              incorporated into several experiments in the undergraduate                     
              meteorological instrumentatin course, primarily for use with  wind             
              tunnel anemometer and vane calibration experiments  and solar radiation        
              spatial measurements. A remote meteorological measurement system is            
              being acquired for classrom lecture demonstrations, use in laboratory          
              courses and for field measurements in connection with senior thesis            
              research projects. The faculty is working with selected seniors to             
              develop new pedagogical tools based on the new instrumentation and             
              computer data processing systems. The university will contribute an            
              amount equal to the award.
