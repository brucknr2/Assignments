Abstract    :
              This project extends the capabilities of the engineering graphics              
              laboratory.  The equipment for the project consists of two computer            
              workstations equipped for solid modeling and one computer aided                
              modeling machine with software.  This equipment adds both rendering and        
              protype making capabilities to existing courses.  This enhances the            
              visualization process, provides "hands-on" experience, and illustrates         
              machine shop automation.  The project impacts a student body with a            
              large percentage of minority and a historically high drop out rate.            
              The award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal               
              investigator's institution.
