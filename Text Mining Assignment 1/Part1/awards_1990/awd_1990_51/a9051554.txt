Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Chemistry has identified principles which guide the choice of              
              laboratory experimentation.  These guidelines include the need to              
              incorporate work using smaller and more complex samples, the need              
              to incorporate real world chemistry, the opportunity to use                    
              state-of-the-art instrumentation, the necessity to increase the                
              laboratory efficiency so that more experimental work can be done,              
              and the need to increase understanding of chemical health and                  
              safety.  The gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer equipment is                  
              helping to include real world samples in the laboratory program,               
              to allow laboratory work to concentrate on small and complex                   
              samples, and to improve the efficiency of the laboratory program.              
              The three courses - Organic Chemistry, Advanced Instrumentation,               
              and Chemical Health and Safety - were selected to show how the                 
              GC/MS can strengthen the chemistry curriculum.                                 
                                                                                             
              The institution has contributed an amount equal to the NSF funds               
              to the project.
