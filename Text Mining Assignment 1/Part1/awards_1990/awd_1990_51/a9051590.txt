Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry will purchase seven novel mobile                   
              data acquisition chemistry workstations which will dramatically                
              enhance all levels of undergraduate education in Chemistry at                  
              Clark University.  One such mobile chemistry workstation has                   
              been built and fully tested in two courses in 1989.  The                       
              workstation was found to be exceptionally useful in                            
              "Introductory Chemistry" and "Instrumental Analysis".  Each of                 
              the workstations comprises state-of-the-art computerized                       
              instructional equipment capable of sampling, storing, analyzing                
              and sumulating data acquired at speeds ranging from pico                       
              seconds up to hundreds of seconds.  Early introduction and                     
              comprehensive incorporation of the workstations will expand the                
              breadth and depth of the science major, and additionally                       
              motivate non-science majors towards an understanding of                        
              comtemporary science and technology.  The wide range of speeds,                
              user friendliness, mobility, and the ability to interchange                    
              each of the workstations will allow utility in all of the                      
              undergraduate laboratories, and facilitate demonstrations and                  
              software presentation in lecture courses.  In the classroom,                   
              the workstations will demonstrate direct comparison of measured                
              and predicted principles, as exemplified by dynamic comparison                 
              of simulated weak acid equilibria with direct ion selective                    
              electrode measurements.  The workstations encourage highly                     
              interactive experimental procedures.  In the laboratory, mobile                
              units will be connected to a wide variety of equipment, ranging                
              in complexity depending on the particular course or                            
              undergraduate research project.
