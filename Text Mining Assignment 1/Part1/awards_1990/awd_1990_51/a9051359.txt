Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to help purchase equipment which will                
              enhance the ability of the Department of Sociology at the                      
              University of Maine to provide its undergraduates with practical               
              experience in modern methods of accessing and analyzing social                 
              science data.  The funds will be used to purchase a 9-track                    
              magnetic tape reader, 5 large microcomputers, software which will              
              network the computers, and a printer and plotter for output.  The              
              equipment will be used in two courses, Practicum in Sociological               
              Research, and Population and Society, both of which require                    
              students to complete projects which involve analyzing census and               
              survey data.  The project is significant in providing a bridge                 
              between traditional mainframe sources and the ease and flexibility             
              of microcomputers, and in the use of command files within                      
              statistical packages as templates in guiding students to                       
              independent use of social statistics.  The grantee is matching this            
              award with non-Federal sources.
