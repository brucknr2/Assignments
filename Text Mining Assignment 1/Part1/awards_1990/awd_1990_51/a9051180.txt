Abstract    :
              The Shannon Point Marine Center is developing innovative programs in           
              undergraduate teaching and student research in marine science, for             
              students at Western Washington but also students from local community          
              colleges. Revisions in the Marine Algae course emphasize ecological            
              physiology and experimental phycology by the application of modern             
              techniques to study the biology of marine plants. Radioisotopes and            
              fluorometry are being used as tools to study organic carbon, nutrient,         
              and energy cycles as well as algal biomass and growth. The Marine              
              Ecology course is applying radiotracers to study feeding and energy            
              transformation in invertebrates. Workshops are being run to train              
              community college faculty and students, WWU science majors and                 
              independent study students in the use of radioisotopes and fluorometry         
              as tools in scientific investigation of marine systems. The university         
              will contribute an amount equal to the award.
