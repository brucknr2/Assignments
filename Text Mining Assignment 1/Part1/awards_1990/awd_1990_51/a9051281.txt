Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to expose undergraduate civil                      
              engineering students to the wide variety of field test equipment               
              they will be encountering in geotechnical engineering practice.                
              This training has not traditionally been included as part of the               
              undergraduate curricula at most universities, yet field testing                
              has as the primary design tools for geotechnical engineering                   
              firms.  Current industry needs are therefore dictating a change                
              in the focus of undergraduate civil engineering education.  This               
              change includes a greater emphasis on interdisciplinary testing                
              techniques.  Engineers are relying on geological and geophysical               
              methods in conjunction with geotechnical field test to conduct                 
              engineering surveys and determine design parameters.  The                      
              equipment was selected in an effort to expose students to some                 
              other tools most widely used in current practice:  a nuclear                   
              density device, a dilatometer, and geophysical equipment                       
              (seismograph, resistivity meter and magnetometer).  Approximately              
              170 students per year will become acquainted with these new tools              
              through field exercises incorporated into three undergraduate                  
              civil engineering courses.
