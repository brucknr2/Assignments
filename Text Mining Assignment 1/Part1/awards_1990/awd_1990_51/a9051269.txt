Abstract    :
                   The focus of this project is the development of a                         
              laboratory for instruction in artificial intelligence.  The                    
              use of a standard hardware base and the development of                         
              educational versions of AI's foundational programs are key                     
              aspects of the work.  The goal is to fill the widening gap                     
              between introductory undergraduate courses and the more                        
              advanced material typically handled in graduate seminars.                      
                   This project is significant because it specifically                       
              addresses the gap between introductory AI courses and higher                   
              level courses.  This gap is widening and it must be addressed                  
              through enhanced laboratory instruction at the undergraduate                   
              level.
