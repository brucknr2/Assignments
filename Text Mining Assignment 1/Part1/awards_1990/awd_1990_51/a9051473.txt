Abstract    :
              Resources are made available to acquire computers, auxiliary                   
              equipment for computer support, and commercial software for                    
              equipping a hypermedia learning laboratory for use by                          
              undergraduate engineering students.  This laboratory will be used              
              for formal teaching of computer techniques to be utilized in                   
              freshman and sophomore courses.  In addition, it will be made                  
              available for students to use computer aided instructional (CAI)               
              material prepared as supplemental learning material for civil                  
              engineering courses.  This information will be prepared in a                   
              hypermedia format which may include text, sound, animation, video              
              sequences, photographs, example and practice problems, and                     
              assessment instruments.  CAI can supplement and enrich course                  
              material initially presented in the classroom.  Data bases                     
              listing design criteria, material properties and specifications,               
              cost, regulatory rules, etc. can be provided with equipment now                
              available in purchased for wordprocessing, spreadsheets,                       
              CAD,graphics development and programs for solving specific                     
              problems in the various topic area will be available for the                   
              students to use in their preparation of both oral and written                  
              class assignments.
