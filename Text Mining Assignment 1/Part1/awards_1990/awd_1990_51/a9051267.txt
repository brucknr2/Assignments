Abstract    :
              The department is purchasing a scanning electron microscope, a                 
              critical-point dryer and sputter-coater for SEM preparation, and a             
              research quality multi-functional light microscope equipped for                
              brightfield, phase-contrast, epi-fluorescence and DIC optics and for           
              photomicrography. This new equipment is being integrated with present          
              equipment to 1. develop and upgrade hands-on courses in light and              
              electron microscopy, 2. improve the existing laboratories in                   
              Developmental Biology, Cell Biology, Experimental Genetics, Recombinant        
              DNA, Histology, and Immunology courses, and 3. provide new equipment           
              for undergraduate research projects. It is expected that the                   
              experiences will enhance the students' ability to think critically,            
              give them opportunities to design experiments using the modern                 
              instruments, and can stimulate students to go on to careers in science.        
              The university will contribute an amount equal to the award.
