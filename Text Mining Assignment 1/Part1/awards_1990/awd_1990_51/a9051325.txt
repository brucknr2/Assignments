Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              NeXTLab, a computer laboratory in the department of Marine, Earth              
              and Atmospheric Sciences at North Carolina State University                    
              (NCSU), is designed to facilitate the teaching of fundamental                  
              scientific principles to undergraduate students.  NeXTLab                      
              (consisting of a network of 12 NeXT User workstations and 2                    
              NeXTLab Servers) will utilize the latest generation of                         
              workstation technology, one that combines remarkable computer                  
              power, affordability, and a user-friendly interface.                           
              Applications in which NeXTLab's technology excels include:i)                   
              Animation (high-resolution postscript display) to show the time                
              evolution of weather systems ozone depletion, pollution                        
              dispersion, beach erosion, etc; ii) Digital signal processing                  
              (dedicated chip) to teach turbulent time series analysis, and                  
              atmospheric remote sensing, etc; iii) Mass storage (660 MB hard                
              disk, 256 MB read/write optical disk) a prerequisite for                       
              animation and signal processing, as well as for applications that              
              rely on large data bases (eg., global warming, ozone depletion,                
              numerical model output).  NeXTLab's innovative programming                     
              environment allows software developers to create a graphical                   
              user-friendly interface for educational applications (generally                
              the most time-consuming part) without any programming|                         
              Educational applications will be made available nationally and                 
              publicized through journal articles to promote the innovative                  
              use of computer workstations in teaching science in undergraduate              
              classrooms and laboratory settings.  Support from UNIDATA ( a                  
              national NSF funded program to distribute "real time"                          
              meteorological data sets) and a new building facility at NCSU                  
              makes this an opportune time to proceed with development of                    
              NeXTLab.
