Abstract    :
              The equipment purchased for this undertaking is in support of the              
              required, year long senior electrical engineering design sequence of           
              three courses.  The sequence begins at the end of the junior year when         
              the students choose a project, a faculty advisor, and an industrial            
              sponsor.  During the first term of the senior year each student                
              completes a formal proposal and a paper design of the proposed                 
              apparatus.  Projects are completed in the second semester and require          
              construction and test or other suitable means of performance                   
              verification.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              The award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal               
              investigator's institution.
