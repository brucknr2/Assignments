Abstract    :
              The aim of the Science Communications Project is to have the                   
              undergraduate students experience how to approach a scientific problem         
              while learning how information is communicated in science. Students are        
              required to write a research proposal, design and perform an                   
              independent team project, write a research report, and conduct a poster        
              session at the end of the semester. Also required are peer reviews of          
              other teams' proposals and reports. The purchase of a dual-beam                
              spectrophotometer with a computer linkage is expanding the research            
              capabilities of the students and accelerating their progress. The              
              instrument is used primarily for enzyme activity assays and protein            
              determinations. This program is more akin to real biological science           
              than the standard cookbook laboratory experience in which the results          
              are known ahead of time. The college is contributing an amount equal           
              to the award.
