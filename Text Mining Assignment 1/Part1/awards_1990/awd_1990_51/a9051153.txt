Abstract    :
              The acquisition of a gas chromatograph and infrared                            
              spectrophotometer has provided both first and second-year                      
              chemistry students with new experiences in instrumental analysis.              
              Concepts that previously were addressed through computer                       
              laboratory simulation are now incorporated into specific                       
              laboratory experiments.  Students in organic chemistry are first               
              introduced to gas chromatography as they separate a mixture of 2-              
              propanol and cyclohexane mixture; subsequently they analyze a                  
              product mixture after halogenation of an alkylbenzene.  Finally                
              both of the instruments are used in the characterization of a                  
              product after its prior isolation, and in updating the                         
              qualitative organic analysis experience as instrumental methods                
              supplant or complement wet methods.                                            
                                                                                             
              A GC experiment involving the identification of the                            
              transesterified fatty acids derived from common cooking oils has               
              been added to the laboratory of the Principles of Chemistry -                  
              Organic & Biochemistry sequence to complement experiments that                 
              demonstrate three other major chromatographic techniques.  Highly              
              motivated students in the General Chemistry I-II sequence use the              
              instruments as they choose a special laboratory experiment to                  
              carry out as they complete their final semester of the sequence.               
                                                                                             
              The institution has contributed to the project an amount equal to              
              the NSF funds.
