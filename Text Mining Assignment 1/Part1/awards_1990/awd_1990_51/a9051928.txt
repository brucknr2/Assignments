Abstract    :
              A research computer laboratory is being developed in the Psychology            
              Department to facilitate the teaching of experimental methods via the          
              execution and analysis of original student research projects. The lab          
              thus facilitates an experiential approach to learning research                 
              methodology, including problem conceptualization, experimental design,         
              research methodology including problem conceptualization, experimental         
              design, research execution, data analysis, and report writing. A               
              standardized set of software tools, used throughout the four-course            
              research sequence, helps to provide continuity to the research                 
              curriculum. The computer lab also helps demonstrate the steps in               
              hypothesis testing, simulate classic experimental designs, and test            
              students' ability to critically evaluate specific experimental designs.        
              The computing laboratory, with a network of 11 PC computers and                
              associated peripherals, thus gives students an experiential                    
              understanding of empirical methods via an integrated, cumulative               
              research sequence. The university will contribute an amount equal to           
              the award.
