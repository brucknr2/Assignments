Abstract    :
              Students at all undergraduate levels are benefitting from a                    
              laboratory equipped with IBM compatible computers and a variety of             
              software.  They are addressing issues related to the advantages and            
              limitations of problem solving using computers, and doing                      
              simulations, experimentation, and testing of algorithms.  The                  
              institution will contribute an amount equal to the award.//
