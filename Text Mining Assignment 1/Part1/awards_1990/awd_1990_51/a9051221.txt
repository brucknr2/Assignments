Abstract    :
              With the advent of the special-purpose graphics processor, graphics            
              system design is feasible in a university undergraduate                        
              environment.  This project serves to strengthen the curriculum in              
              the areas of graphics, image processing, microprocessor-based                  
              design, and capstone design through the creation of a graphics                 
              system design laboratory facility and the creation of a new                    
              graphics design course.  The facility and the new course are based             
              on the TMS34010 graphics processor.  The equipment required                    
              includes eight student stations where the design, testing,                     
              debugging and documentation of laboratory exercises take place.                
              The laboratory course consists of a series of structured exercises             
              culminating in a term project which integrates all of the preceding            
              exercises into a graphics system.  This provides for teaching                  
              state-of-the-art graphics system design, as well as fundamental                
              microprocessor-based design.  The award is being matched by an                 
              equal amount from the principal investigator's institution.
