Abstract    :
              Undergraduate psychology students' science education is being                  
              improved by providing computer controlled data collection                      
              stations, multiuser workstations for data analysis, and file                   
              service for students involved in original research.  Students                  
              join ongoing research teams organized around specific research                 
              problems, and make contributions to that area by conducting their              
              own original research experiments and continuing work of previous              
              students using the research team's data pool.  The college will                
              contribute an amount equal to the award.
