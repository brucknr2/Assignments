Abstract    :
              The Multi-Purpose General Science Laboratory allows majors and non             
              -majors opportunities to participate in scientific experiments in              
              several disciplines including: physics, chemistry, biology,                    
              environmental science, and general science.  The multi-purpose                 
              laboratory enables majors to explore the sciences more fully and               
              serves as a "hands-on" laboratory for non-majors completing the                
              general education requirement.  The grantee provides funds for this            
              project that are more than an equal match for the NSF award.
