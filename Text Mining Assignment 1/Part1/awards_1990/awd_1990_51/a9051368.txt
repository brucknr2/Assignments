Abstract    :
              The acquisition of a preparative ultracentrifuge and a liquid                  
              scintillation counter is facilitating the upgrading of the                     
              biochemistry laboratory. Students can now use contemporary methods for         
              the purification and analysis of biomolecules. These instruments allow         
              the conversion of the course into a multistep experimental format,             
              designed to illustrate the sequential nature of scientific inquiry. The        
              instruments also enhance the flexibility of experimental design, both          
              in the laboratory course and in undergraduate research projects. This          
              will result in better student understanding of scientific research and         
              increased familiarity with the uses and applications of modern                 
              biochemical methodologies. The university will contribute an amount            
              equal to the award.
