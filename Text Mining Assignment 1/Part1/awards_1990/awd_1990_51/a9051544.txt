Abstract    :
              This project is to increase the effectiveness of courses and                   
              undergraduate research in optical engineering.  Students study the             
              practical essentials of fiber optic design especially those aspects            
              that are verifiable in the laboratory.  Additionally there is                  
              opportunity for in-depth study and independent research.  Optical              
              systems are designed and tested under conditions similar to that of the        
              workplace.  Graduates are therefore better prepared for the kind of            
              practical work expected of them as optical engineers.  Students are            
              encouraged to engage in special topics in optical engineering under the        
              guidance of a mentor with the expectation that some will seek careers          
              in research who otherwise would go directly into industry.  In any case        
              the research experience widens students' horizons and allows then to           
              contribute to the knowledge base of this increasingly important area of        
              engineering.  The award is being matched by an equal amount from the           
              principal investigator's institution.
