Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This instrumentation for Thermogravimetric Analysis and                        
              Diffrential Scanning Calorimetry will equip undergraduate                      
              laboratories in analytical, physical, and polymer chemistry at                 
              the University of Florida.  It will be used to characterize and                
              quantify mixtures of inorganic materials in an instrumental                    
              analysis laboratory incorporating physical chemistry and physical              
              polymer students.
