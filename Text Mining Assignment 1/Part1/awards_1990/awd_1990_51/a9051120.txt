Abstract    :
              Understanding lighting and electrical power distribution is                    
              critical in today's high-tech, energy conscious, building                      
              environment.  The wide spread dependance on electronic media has               
              emphasized the need for quality, well designed lighting to                     
              increase visibility and productivity, as well as reliable                      
              electrical power distribution and communication systems.                       
                                                                                             
              The Lighting and Electrical Systems Classroom and Laboratory will              
              enhance the education of 500 students over the next five years in              
              the areas of lighting and electrical systems for buildings.  With              
              the numerous lighting systems, lighting controls data acquisition              
              and computing equipment of the facility.  Students will be able                
              to see lighting fundamental applied in state-of-the-art lighting               
              systems.  Students will be able to evaluate visually and with                  
              actual measurements and mathematical models of lighting.  To                   
              enhance the student's understanding of building electrical                     
              distribution, the present project includes actual components of                
              electrical distribution equipment, connected and installed                     
              identically to an actual application but not energized.                        
                                                                                             
              The electrical and lighting manufacturing industry is providing                
              strong support for the project.  They have provided letters of                 
              intent to donate almost $37,000 worth of lighting and electrical               
              distribution equipment.
