Abstract    :
                   New experiments in modern optics will be introduced, and                  
              the introductory teaching laboratory in waves and optics for                   
              non-science students as well as for physics majors will be                     
              modernized at the University of Chicago.  New instrumentation                  
              would allow experiments in fiber optics, image processing and                  
              Fourier optics, in addition to those in holography, diffraction                
              and interference, polarization, laser physics and photo-                       
              electric effect.  Today, students encounter applications of the                
              new optical technology in the outside world:  fiber optic                      
              communication, laser compact discs, bar code readers, laser                    
              surgery and holograms.  This contact and awareness of modern                   
              developments will be exploited by novel experiments in the                     
              undergraduate teaching laboratories.  New physical science                     
              courses for the non-science student have been developed                        
              recently at the University of Chicago and there is an urgent                   
              need to create new experimental protocols in modern optics.
