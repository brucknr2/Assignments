Abstract    :
              The Environmental Study program emphasizes "hands-on" experiential             
              science instruction and involves students in research projects in              
              the areas of biological science, meteorology, conservation, and                
              astronomy. Appropriate field equipment is being purchased to                   
              support this diverse program. Projects involve individual and class            
              research with the steps of selecting a problem, literature review,             
              research procedure, data compilation, discussion of results,                   
              summary and conclusion. Research papers will be written and                    
              reported. This program allows students to experience the scientific            
              method directly through field research. This fosters the students'             
              interest in science, and their development of an understanding of              
              environmental science which will allow for wise environmental and              
              natural resource decisions. The college will contribute an amount              
              equal to the award.
