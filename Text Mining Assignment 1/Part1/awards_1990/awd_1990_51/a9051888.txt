Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to the Department of Botany at Ohio State            
              University to help purchase equipment to be used in a new two-                 
              quarter course in modern plant biology.  The new course (BOT 102)              
              includes a completely new laboratory component.  Written by experts            
              in sub-specialties of plant science, most exercises use the new                
              rapid cycling Brassicas and all call for hands-on experimentation              
              and observation using current technology.  Equipment to be                     
              purchased with this grant will be used in three of the ten lab                 
              exercises:  1) For Cell Structure--video cameras, monitors, and                
              video recorders will allow the students to observe special cellular            
              structures and phenomena visible with fluorescent or oil immersion             
              microscopy...instruments which are prohibitively expensive for                 
              individual student use. 2)  For Development and Biotechnology--                
              sterile transfer hoods will support experiments with plant hormones            
              using tissue culture techniques.  3)  For Photosynthesis,                      
              Phototropism, and Phototaxis--the students will use                            
              spectrophotometers, chart recorders, quantum radiometers,                      
              centrifuges, balances, etc. to learn how plants absorb and utilize             
              light efficiently in food production.  The grantee is matching this            
              award with non-Federal sources.
