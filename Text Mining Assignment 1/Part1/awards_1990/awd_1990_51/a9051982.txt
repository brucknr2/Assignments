Abstract    :
                   New electronic and optical instrumentation will be                        
              acquired for two advanced laboratories.  This will include                     
              equipment for computer control, digital data acquisition, data                 
              storage, and data treatment in several different modern                        
              physics experiments involving chaos, the speed of light,                       
              superconductivity, atomic energy states, and optical                           
              interference and diffraction.  A whole new field of laser                      
              related physics experiments will be opened for students with                   
              the acquisition of the proposed pulsed YAG and the tunable CW                  
              diode laser systems.  New experiments in non-linear optics, Q                  
              switching, CW and pulsed laser operation, diode laser mode                     
              structure, molecular spectroscopy, coherence length and others                 
              will be introduced.  Fiber optics experiments involving single                 
              and multimode propagation, mode structure, and data                            
              transmission will be introduced.  The equipment is state of the                
              art and presents students with the opportunity to employ modern                
              measurement capabilities in studying important physical                        
              phenomena of current interest.
