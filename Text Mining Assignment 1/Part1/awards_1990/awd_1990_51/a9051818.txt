Abstract    :
                   Custom integrated circuit technology has played a signif-                 
              icant role in the development of digital systems.  It is impor-                
              tant that all electrical engineers become familiar with                        
              designing, testing, simulating, and verifying the digital systems              
              in a Computer Aided System.  Therefore, there is much interest in              
              introducing this technology into the undergraduate curriculum.                 
              The goal of this project is to develop the Advanced Digital                    
              Design and Interfacing course around ALTERA EPLDs (Erasable                    
              Programmable Logic Devices).  The equipment acquired is for the                
              design of digital circuits, interfacing circuits, peripherals,                 
              microcoded and hardwired controllers, and computer communication               
              devices.  This development system enhances the electrical                      
              engineering curriculum and improves the quality of the education               
              offered to students.                                                           
                                                                                             
                   The award is being matched by an equal amount from the                    
              principal investigator's institution.
