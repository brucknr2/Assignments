Abstract    :
              The laboratory components of the biology, marine biology, and                  
              oceanography courses are being revised to shift the emphasis away from         
              traditional laboratories to one which requires the students to be              
              active participants in an ongoing research project in local estuaries.         
              Pilot studies for this approach were done at a summer institute for            
              high school students. In order to involve students in this long-term           
              research project, sophisticated analytical equipment is being                  
              incorporated into the project in order to analyze water samples and            
              field biological data rapidly and accurately. This project will provide        
              the students with hands-on research experiences in collection and              
              analysis of data which will ultimately provide an ecological baseline          
              of the waters in the region. The college will contribute an amount             
              equal to the award.
