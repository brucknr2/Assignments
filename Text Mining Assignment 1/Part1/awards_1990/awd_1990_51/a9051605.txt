Abstract    :
              Students in all the calculus courses are using the calculus laboratory         
              equipped with HP28S calculators and IBM PS/2 computers running Derive.         
              These students are able to improve their intuition about the major             
              underlying concepts and are dealing with more realistic applications of        
              calculus.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              The institution will contribute an amount equal to the award.
