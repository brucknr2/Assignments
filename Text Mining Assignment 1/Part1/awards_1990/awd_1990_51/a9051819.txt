Abstract    :
              A new cell biology course is being instituted within the core biology          
              curriculum, which will integrate central biochemical principles into a         
              cellular setting, and, in the laboratory, exploit a broad range of             
              optical and biochemical approaches for probing cellular phenomena. New         
              equipment for this course, as well as for an upper division cell               
              biology course, includes sophisticated microscopes and image recording         
              systems for observation of processes in living cells, a new centrifuge         
              for cell fractionation experiments, and mini gel electrophoresis and           
              blotting equipment for analysis of membrane and cytoskeletal proteins.         
              The college will contribute an amount equal to the award.
