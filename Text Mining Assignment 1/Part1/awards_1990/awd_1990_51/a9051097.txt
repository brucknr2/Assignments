Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Department of Chemistry is in its sixth year of a strategic                
              plan to modernize its academic laboratory capabilities.  Recent                
              modernization includes conversion of the organic laboratories to               
              the microscale.  The most limiting deficiency in the program had               
              been the lack of NMR instrumentation with carbon 13 capabilities.              
              This project allowed for the acquisition of a NMR that has                     
              a) facilitated student hands-on experiences in the second-                     
              semester microscale organic chemistry,  b) allowed the creation                
              of an advanced-level microscale organic laboratory program,                    
              c) facilitated the development of new microscale organic                       
              chemistry experiments which are utilized in the program, and                   
              d) improved junior-level biochemistry and instrumental analysis                
              laboratory offerings.                                                          
                                                                                             
              The institution is contributing to this project in an amount                   
              equal to the NSF funds.
