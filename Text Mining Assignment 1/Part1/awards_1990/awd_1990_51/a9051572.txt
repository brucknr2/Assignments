Abstract    :
                   This project establishes a computer-aided engineering                     
              environment for students doing computer designs and                            
              implementations in their undergraduate computer architecture                   
              courses.  The environment includes tools for combinational                     
              and sequential network design and for automatic generation of                  
              netlist forms for validation using digital simulation.  The                    
              project will provide modern workstations that will ensure the                  
              feasibility of doing realistic designs.  These designs                         
              include microprogrammed microprocessor design in the                           
              introductory computer architecture course, and parallel                        
              processor designs in the advanced term.   The designs are                      
              validated using gate-level and functional simulation.                          
                   This project is significant in establishing a laboratory                  
              mode for computer architecture that allows large and complete                  
              computer designs within a reasonable amount of time.  The                      
              workstations provide a stimulating interactive environment                     
              for constructing and debugging computers.
