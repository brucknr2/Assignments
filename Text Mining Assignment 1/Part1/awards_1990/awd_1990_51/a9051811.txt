Abstract    :
              Bates College is purchasing a quantitative x-ray microanalysis                 
              system with image enhancement and processing capabilities, which               
              will enable students to be exposed to modern techniques in analysis            
              of geologic materials, improve the school's instructional                      
              capabilities, and strengthen their program of undergraduate                    
              research. The x-ray microanalysis system will be attached to a                 
              newly acquired scanning electron microscope. The addition of this              
              equipment to the geology curriculum allows for 1. the introduction             
              of a new course in quantitative microanalysis of geologic                      
              materials, 2. considerable improvement in laboratory exercises                 
              offered to upper level students, and 3. modernization and                      
              improvement of student thesis research, independent study, and                 
              faculty-sponsored research. The equipment should enhance student               
              interest in the geosciences, and provide students with state-of-               
              the-art, hands on experience in techniques used in graduate work               
              and industry. The college will contribute support equal to the                 
              award.
