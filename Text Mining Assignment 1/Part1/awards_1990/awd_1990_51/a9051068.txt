Abstract    :
              This project establishes an undergraduate Ada laboratory for upper             
              level computer science courses.  Central to this undertaking is the            
              acquisition of eight 80386 based IBM-compatible computers with Ada             
              software including an integrated programming environment.  These are           
              used for instruction in Data Structures, Operating Systems, and                
              Software Engineering.  Emphasis is placed on the use of both the               
              current and expanding literature in these areas. The award is being            
              matched by an equal amount from the principal investigator's                   
              institution.
