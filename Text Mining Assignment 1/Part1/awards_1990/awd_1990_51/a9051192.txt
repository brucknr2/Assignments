Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry will acquire an automatic sample                   
              changer, a variable temperature attachment and six                             
              microcomputers for use with an existing 300 MHz NMR                            
              spectrometer.  The sample changer will run during off hours and                
              greatly increase the number and sophistication of the NMR                      
              experiments the students can perform.  Also to be developed is                 
              a "flight simulator" program to run on personal computers to                   
              familiarize students with the menus and displays of the NMR                    
              spectrometer software so they can make efficient use of the                    
              instrument during their hands-on time.  The temperature control                
              accessory will enhance the usefulness of the instrument in the                 
              physical chemistry laboratory courses.
