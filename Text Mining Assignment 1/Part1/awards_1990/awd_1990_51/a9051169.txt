Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Through this project, the institution was able to purchase a gas               
              chromatograph/mass spectrometer.  A central theme is the                       
              improvement of students' understanding of reaction mechanisms and              
              stereochemistry.  In the first semester Organic Chemistry, GC/MS               
              helped to introduce the concept of carbocation stability.  In the              
              second semester, GC/MS was used to analyze the stereochemistry of              
              addition reactions that form threo- or erythro-bromo-                          
              deuteriobutane and the subsequent base-promoted elimination                    
              reactions of these stereoisomers.  Such difficult concepts are                 
              seldom addressed in conventional organic laboratory due to the                 
              lack of proper instrumentation.  In Physical Chemistry the GC/MS               
              is being used to determine kinetic isotope effects and                         
              stereochemistry for gas-phase syn-elimination of the previously                
              prepared deuterated bromobutanes.  The Instrumental Chemistry                  
              course is emphasizing technique, operation of the instrument, its              
              capabilities and interpretation of spectra.  In Environmental                  
              Chemistry GC/MS is helping demonstrate detection and                           
              quantification of organic contaminants in ground water.  Many                  
              students find the GC/MS vital to their undergraduate research                  
              projects.  Through more sophisticated experiments the GC/MS is                 
              improving instruction in Organic, Physical, Instrumental, and                  
              Environmental Chemistry courses.                                               
                                                                                             
              The institution contributed to this project in an amount equal to              
              the NSF funds.
