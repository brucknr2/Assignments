Abstract    :
              The school is purchasing a high-speed centrifuge and a high                    
              performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC), including computer interface          
              for efficient data analysis and storage, for use in a new undergraduate        
              biochemistry laboratory. This instrumentation supplements the                  
              university's commitment to the project. The laboratory is part of a new        
              biochemistry major, which provides students with hands-on experiences          
              with modern instrumentation. The laboratory gives the students practise        
              in a wide range of traditional techniques, as well as in depth exposure        
              to contemporary methods, including molecular separation and                    
              computerized data handling. The educational goals achieved by the              
              project will be important to the future careers of the students. The           
              university will contribute an amount equal to the award.
