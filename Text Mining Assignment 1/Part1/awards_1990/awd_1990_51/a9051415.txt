Abstract    :
              The psychology department computer lab is designed to provide modern           
              instruction through the use of personal computers. Students in a large         
              number of undergraduate courses, including introductory and advanced           
              courses, are learning to use computers as a teaching/learning tool and         
              are also acquiring relevant computer skills to help prepare them for           
              careers or graduate study in psychology. The department, which serves          
              large numbers of minority and women students, is purchasing twelve             
              Zenith PCs with color monitors, two laptops, a number of printers,             
              modems for mainframe connection of three omputers to permit their use          
              as terminals, and on hard disk drive file server to network the                
              system. This system is also available for use by independent study and         
              honors project students. The university will contribute an amount equal        
              to the award.
