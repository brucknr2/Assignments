Abstract    :
              Northland College, a liberal arts/environmental college in northern            
              Wisconsin, which has a significant population of Native Americans,             
              has made a considerable investment in improving computer facilities            
              for the Earth Science/Physics programs and is now enhancing its                
              offerings in environmental modeling classes. To accomplish this,               
              a satellite downlink (CONTEL) is being purchased to obtain real-               
              time meteorological data for model inputs.. Also, a LANDSAT data               
              processing system (ERDAS, Earth Resources Data Acquisition Systems)            
              is being purchased to improve the skills of students in                        
              environmental analysis and interpretation. In addition, a course               
              is planned for aiding Native Americans in resource classification,             
              management, and utilization. The college will contribute an amount             
              equal to the award.
