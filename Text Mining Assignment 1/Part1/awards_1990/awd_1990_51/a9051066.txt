Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Our Department of Marine, Earth, and Atmospheric Sciences                 
              proposes to initiate a new field course on Margarita Island,                   
              Venezuela for the benefit of undergraduates in all three of our                
              disciplines, including students form other campuses nationally.                
              This course would address the physical environment, unlike the                 
              many biologically-oriented field courses which are offered at                  
              tropical research stations.  Logistical support would come from a              
              marine institute, Fundacion La Salle de Ciencias Naturales, which              
              has 300 employees on Magarita Island.  This institute collects                 
              data in all three disciplines and presently supports five of our               
              graduate students.  Most of the field equipment needed for the                 
              proposed course already is available.  The remaining equipment                 
              would be provided under the terms of this proposal, e.g. grab                  
              samplers and peat corers, an S4 meter for marine currents, and                 
              several meteorological instruments.  Much of this course would be              
              devoted to interrelationships among marine, tectonic, and                      
              atmospheric processes.  To our knowledge, this inter-disciplinary              
              approach would be unique among tropical field courses.
