Abstract    :
              The increased demands upon industrial and transportation equipment             
              (power plants, airplanes, etc.), coupled with the continuing shortage          
              of engineers familiar with the potential (and shortcomings) associated         
              with Non-Destructive Testing (NDT), make it imperative that this be an         
              area of increased emphasis in the education of today's engineering             
              students.  This project expands and upgrades the Non-Destructive               
              Testing Laboratory by augmenting present A-scan capabilities with two          
              B-scan units.  These two instruments, with auxiliary computer                  
              equipment, provide the portability and versatility necessary for               
              demonstrating NDT techniques in a realistic environment.  The NDT              
              laboratory supports and provides practical applications to a variety           
              of disciplines.  The award is being matched by an equal amount from the        
              principal investigator's institution.
