Abstract    :
                   This supplementary award funds Rutgers University's Industry/             
              University Cooperative Research Center for Ceramics to perform                 
              collaborative research with Pennsylvania State University's                    
              Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Dielectrics on             
              a project "Effects of Particle and Grain Size on the Phase                     
              Transitions and Dielectric Properties of Barium Titanate."  Both               
              Centers' Industry Advisory Boards have recommended and cost shared             
              this two year project.                                                         
                   A woman undergraduate is also funded to augment the Center's              
              research studying the processing of submicron powders of complex               
              prevoskite materials and conventional ceramic processing.                      
                   Three years of supplementary funding is also provided to                  
              maintain the evaluation protocols for the Center.                              
                   The Program Manager recommends that Rutgers University be                 
              awarded $50,000 for two (2) years for a "TIE" project with                     
              Pennsylvania State University.  $24,000 for three (3) years is also            
              recommended for the evaluator costs.  Another $5,000 for one (1)               
              year is recommended for the woman undergraduate with funds from the            
              Women, Minority and Disabled Engineering Research Assistants                   
              Program.
