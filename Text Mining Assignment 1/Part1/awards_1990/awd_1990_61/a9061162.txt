Abstract    :
                   Numerical Grid-generation Algorithms are becoming more                    
              critical due to the need for detailed modeling of the geometry of              
              the physical domain and as part of solution-adaptive algorithms.               
              Current planar grid generation algorithms are not robust because               
              they frequently produce skewed or folded grids.  These problems                
              can be corrected by trial and error modifications (e.g., to the                
              source term of a Poisson equation), but the procedure is far from              
              automatic.                                                                     
                   Mathematical analysis will be used to clarify the                         
              limitations of current algorithms and to suggest new algorithms.               
              The best algorithms will be incorporated into user-friendly                    
              automatic grid-generation codes which will have: a common                      
              interface; namelist input; interactive graphics; a library of                  
              geometries; and test problems.  The codes will be designed to run              
              on parallel and vector computers.
