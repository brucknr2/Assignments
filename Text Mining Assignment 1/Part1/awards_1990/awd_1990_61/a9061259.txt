Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Researchers at the University of New Mexico have                               
              discovered a low density, anomalously low surface area,                        
              sol-gel derived alumina-silicate composition.  The                             
              development suggests application of this material                              
              as a hermetic coating in a range of applications that                          
              cannot tolerate the high temperatures required to densify                      
              conventional films.  The transport (i.e., hermetic)                            
              properties must be quantified for specific engineering                         
              applications.  The result will be an understanding of the                      
              process-microstructure-transport properties of this                            
              material.  An existing vacuum system will be modified for                      
              permeation studies.  Aluminasilicate films of various                          
              thicknesses will be cast by various techniques, thermally                      
              treated, and diffusion properties measured.                                    
              Microstructural characteristics of the coating will be                         
              correlated with diffusion properties.  Iterative studies of                    
              diffusion properties as a function of sol-gel processing                       
              conditions will be conducted.
