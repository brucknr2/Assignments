Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The electronics industry has shown considerable interest in                    
              semiconducting compounds with specially tailored electrical and                
              optical properties for fabrication of a variety of electro-optic               
              devices such as photodetectors and IR and visible lasers.  One                 
              method that is commonly used to tailor the properties of various               
              materials is adjusting the composition.  This method has been                  
              exploited very successfully in case of materials as HgxCd1-xTe                 
              and GaxAl1-xAs where the change in composition results in                      
              changing Bandgap.  This program will investigate a new material                
              based on the wide bandgap semiconducting system HgBr2-HgI2 which               
              form the ternary material, HgBrxI2-x, mercury bromoiodide.  The                
              bandgap of this ternary compound depends on the ratio of bromine               
              to iodine in the crystal lattice and can be tuned by changing                  
              this ratio.  The bandgap of HgBrxI2-x can be varied to cover                   
              almost the entire visible region of the electromagnetic                        
              spectrum.  Such a material can be used in a wide range of                      
              electro-optic applications.  The goal of this program is the                   
              method to prepare, purify and grow single crystals of HgBrxI2-x                
              and to characterize the optical and electronic properties of this              
              material and to investigate the variation in these properties                  
              with changing composition.
