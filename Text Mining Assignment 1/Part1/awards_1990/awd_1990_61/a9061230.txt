Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The objective of Phase I of this innovative materials research                 
              program is to develop a high quality, advanced semiconductor                   
              material, which is currently not available to the government or                
              the commercial marketplace, using a variation of the Liquid Phase              
              Electroepitaxy (LPEE) growth technique.  The specific goal is to               
              establish the advantages of the LPEE process for production of                 
              bulk single crystals of GaAs using a Ga1-xBix melt instead of a                
              Ga melt as a solvent.  It is strongly suspected that this                      
              research approach will lead to significantly enhanced                          
              semiconductor materials for government and commercial device                   
              manufacturers.  The successful completion of the Phase I and II                
              efforts will provide a revolutionary high quality material for a               
              wide range of government and commercial applications far into the              
              21st century.  This would directly provide technological and                   
              economic benefits to the nation.
