Abstract    :
              The proposal is to investigate an application-specific computer                
              architecture to solve a class of computer aided design simulation              
              computations based on the Laplace equation.  The goal is to solve              
              typical problems in the class at five times the speed and one                  
              hundredth the cost of current supercomputers.  The intent is to                
              provide 0 (109) floating point operations per second for the                   
              solution of 0(106) node 3-D elliptic problems.  Research being                 
              conducted is: (1) analyze and diagram the arithmetic operations and            
              memory accesses of the iterative Laplace solver; (2) design the                
              corresponding multi-FPU pipelined processor; (3) insure suitability            
              of an existing memory board design and determine the number of                 
              vector memory ports (boards) necessary to sustain the pipeline; (4)            
              program a simulator of the pipeline; and (5) plan wirewrap                     
              fabrication of the pipelined processor
