Abstract    :
              The proposal is to develop a methodology for testing VLSI CAD                  
              software tools, and validate it on a portion of the Berkeley VLSI              
              CAD tool set.  The validation approach is to adapt known software              
              testing techniques to testing of CAD tool software.  Comparison of             
              runs on the test cases is made to the results defined in the                   
              specifications.  Research being done is: (1) define the form of the            
              functional specifications; (2) develop test strategies based on the            
              specifications, but recognize that specs are not complete and use              
              some test strategies that are independent of input-output                      
              specifications; (3) determine test cases generated from the tool's             
              functional specifications and logical - structural properties; and             
              (4) prototype test the methodology.
