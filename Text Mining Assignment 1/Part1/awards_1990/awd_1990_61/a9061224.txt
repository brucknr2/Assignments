Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to determine the                              
              feasibility of increasing the efficiency of production of                      
              ozone by use of gas discharge type ozone generators.                           
              Current efficiencies limit the broader use of this                             
              powerful oxidant and disinfectant.  The Phase I objective                      
              involves approaches to increase the yield of ozone by                          
              modification of conditions used during its generation                          
              which, if successful are planned to be incorporated into                       
              design of a high-yield generator module during the next                        
              phase of this research.                                                        
                                                                                             
              This is a Phase I award made in accord with Program                            
              Solicitation NSF 90-31, Small Business Innovation Research                     
              (SBIR).  The project deals with an innovative concept for                      
              increasing the efficiency of producing ozone, a                                
              water/wastewater disinfectant.
