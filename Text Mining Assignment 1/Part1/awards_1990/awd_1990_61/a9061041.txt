Abstract    :
              This is a SBIR Phase I project in the topic area of biological                 
              instrumentation.  Aprend Technology will develop an optical force              
              trap micromanipulator using a semiconductor laser.  Such a device              
              is potentially useful as an attachment to high powered microscopes             
              used in cell biology research.  If the product becomes readily                 
              available at a reasonable cost, it is likely to be widely used by              
              the research community.
