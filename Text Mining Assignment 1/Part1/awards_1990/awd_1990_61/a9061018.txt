Abstract    :
                   This research will investigate a method for fabricating                   
              microchannel plates which will preserve the gain and                           
              efficiency of existing techniques while improving spatial                      
              resolution and response time at least tenfold.  This new                       
              method is based on accelerator bombardment and particle track                  
              etching.  Passage of a high energy particle through a sheet of                 
              base glass leaves a latent damage trail of broken bonds.  When                 
              submerged in an etching solution, material along the damage                    
              trail etches preferentially to form conical pits which grow                    
              toward each other.  Pairs of etch pits from opposite surfaces                  
              merge to form cylinders which may be shaped into microchannels                 
              controlled by etching conditions.  Phase I will determine                      
              whether the resulting surface in the channel has electrical,                   
              structural, and bulk material properties suitable for particle                 
              detection and signal amplification.
