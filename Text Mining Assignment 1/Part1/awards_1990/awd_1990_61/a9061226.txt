Abstract    :
              Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposed to demonstrate a novel              
              method of externally modulating light in a waveguide, utilizing the            
              surface plasmon polariton (SPP), a two-dimensional electromagnetic             
              wave confined to a metal-dielectric interface by coupling with                 
              quantized charge oscillations.  The proposed SPP modulator device is           
              in contact with a waveguide and consists of:  (1) a thin dielectric            
              buffer layer; (2) a thin metal film of a few hundred atomic layers;            
              (3) an electro-optic material with voltage-controllable refractive             
              index; and (4) the outer electrode.  A prototype modulator will be             
              fabricated on a single mode optical fiber by applying a thin-film              
              deposition of the layers.  When the refractive index of (3) is made            
              equal to that of the effective mode index, there is full coupling of           
              evanescent waves to SPPs and consequent complete loss of light from            
              the wavequide, so that modulation is achieved by changes in the                
              applied voltage.  Unlike conventional devices, an SPP device can be            
              rugged and low cost, operating at very high frequencies with low               
              insertion losses and no back reflections.  The high sensitivity of SPP         
              excitation means that such a modulator can operate at very low                 
              voltages.  The feasibility of two-dimensional switching and modulation         
              matrices will be studied.
