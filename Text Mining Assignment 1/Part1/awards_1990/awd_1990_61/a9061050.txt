Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Molybdenum silicide (MoSi2) based monolithic and composite                     
              materials have potential aircraft applications in the temperature              
              range 1000-1600oC.  MoSi2 based intermetallics have proven to be               
              rather formidable materials to process because of its extreme                  
              brittleness.  In order to successfully process and fabricate                   
              components based on MoSi2, it is necessary to enhance its low                  
              temperature ductility and toughness.  This research focusses on                
              preparation of fine grained MoSi2 via advanced rapid                           
              solidification and powder metallurgical processing to improve its              
              low temperature ductility and toughness.  The fine grain size                  
              will reduce the slip length, therefore, lower the stress                       
              concentration at the grain boundaries and thus enhance ductility.              
              Phase I research will also investigate the effect of TiB2 and HfC              
              dispersoids on grain refinement.  It is expected that these                    
              stable dispersoids will retain the fine microstructure as well as              
              voids around these incoherent particles, especially at high                    
              temperatures.  Phase II research will investigate in more detail               
              the dispersoid/grain boundary and dispersoid/dislocation                       
              interactions to define the processing-microstructure-mechanical                
              property relationships so that optimum mechanical properties                   
              will be attained at both room and elevated temperatures.
