Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to determine the                              
              feasibility of using a beam of high-energy electrons for                       
              reducing the emissions of volatile organic hydrocarbons                        
              that are contained in gases emitted during combustion                          
              processes.  Specific objectives of this initial phase                          
              includes determination of the characteristics of an                            
              electron-beam sustained-discharge that must operate in                         
              contaminated air mixtures, theoretical studies to identify                     
                                                                                             
              the primary chemical mechanisms that must be known for                         
              efficient operation of the process and design of the                           
              approach by which the commercial feasibility of this                           
              concept will be determined.                                                    
                                                                                             
              This is a Phase I award made in accord with Program                            
              Solicitation NSF 90-31, Small Business Innovation Research                     
                                                                                             
              (SBIR).  The project addresses a significant problem in                        
              dealing with treatment of combustion gases prior to their                      
              emission to the atmosphere to reduce emissions of air                          
              pollutants. It may find applicability to treatment of                          
              emissions from oil, gas and coal-fired power plants, trash                     
                                                                                             
              incinerators and from industrial processes for production                      
              of chemicals and application of coatings.                                      
                                                                                             
              Award of an SBIR Phase I is recommended as proposed.
