Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to determine the                              
              feasibility of using fish ventilatory behavior in a system                     
              designed to monitor quality of water.  Research during                         
              this initial phase involves determining the magnitude of                       
              the ventilatory response of fish to presence of toxic                          
              substances and improvement of instrumentation for                              
              determining the nature of the response and its magnitude.                      
                                                                                             
              This is a Phase I award made in accord with Program                            
              Solicitation NSF 90-31, Small Business Innovation Research                     
              (SBIR).  The project addresses a significant problem by                        
              proposing to develop instrumentation that can be used to                       
              detect the presence and significance of substances of                          
              environmental significance in water.  The system may also                      
              be applied to screening of new products to determine their                     
              potential effect on environmental quality during                               
              production and when released to environmental waters.
