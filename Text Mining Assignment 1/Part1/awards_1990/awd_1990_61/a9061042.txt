Abstract    :
              Energy density in proton-exchange-membrane unltracapacitors                    
              can be improved by increasing the dispersion of                                
              electrocatalytic particulates in the electrodes.                               
              Electrochemical ultracapacitors store energy by utilizing                      
              double-layer and surface redox processes.  The key objectives                  
              of this project is the preparation of highly dispersed                         
              ruthenium oxide on carbon.  This material will then be                         
              characterized and incorporated into a prototype ultracapacitor                 
              using a commercial ionomer membrane.                                           
                                                                                             
              Possible applications of high-energy-density electrochemical                   
              ultracapacitors include electric vehicles, pulse-power space                   
              applications, power conditioning, and computer memory backups.
