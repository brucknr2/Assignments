Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The objective of the proposed research is to develop epitaxial                 
              buffer layers grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) that will               
              provide both a diffusion/reaction barrier and a transition in                  
              crystal structure and lattice parameter between a low loss single              
              crystal substrate and an epitaxial, single crystal high                        
              temperature superconducting film.  Phase I will establish proof                
              of concept via homoepitaxy.  For example magnesium oxide films                 
              will be grown on sing crystal magnesium oxide substrates and                   
              lanthanum aluminum oxide films will be grown on single lanthanum               
              aluminum oxide substrates.  The films will be evaluated for                    
              crystal quality, surface smoothness and uniformity, and process                
              conditions will be adjusted to optimize film properties.  In                   
              Phase II the process will be extended to heteroepitaxy, with the               
              goal of providing epitaxial buffer layers for superconducting                  
              films on substrates such as single crystal aluminum oxide                      
              (sapphire) that are high desirable for microwave applications.
