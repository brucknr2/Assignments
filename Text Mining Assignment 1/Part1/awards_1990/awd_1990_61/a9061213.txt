Abstract    :
              X-ray lithography (XRL) requires a mask                                        
              membrane material which is strong, stable,                                     
              radiation resistant, and easy to use in XRL systems.                           
              In European and Japanese programs, silicon                                     
              carbide membranes and complete masks have been                                 
              prepared, tested, and shown to confirm the                                     
              performance expectations for this material.  No                                
              U.S. company has a capability to manufacture SiC                               
              XRL masks; the U.S. clearly lags behind Europe                                 
              and Japan in this technology.                                                  
              In Europe and Japan, ordinary chemical vapor                                   
              deposition at a high and low pressures (CVD and                                
              LPCVD) has been used but these processes are                                   
              neither as convenient nor as flexible as some others                           
              which may also be suitable.  The proposed project                              
              will produce Sic membranes by three different                                  
              methods: rf sputtering; plasma activated chemical                              
              vapor deposition (PACVD); and ion beam assisted                                
              deposition (IBAD).  Thickness, stress, strength, and                           
              preliminary radiation stability measurements will be                           
              made during Phase I.
