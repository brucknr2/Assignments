Abstract    :
              In the proposed research we will develop methodologies and                     
              products for mapping very large pieces of DNA by determining                   
              the overlapping relationships between clones derived from a                    
              partial digest of the DNA.  The method will create the                         
              possibility of ordering end-to-end a large number of partial-                  
              digest cosmid clones derived from segments of DNA as large as                  
              an entire human chromosome.  The proposed method involves                      
              crosshybridization of the inserts from a large number of                       
              cosmid clones to each other independently in all combinations                  
              by applying cloned DNA or probes generated from the clones to                  
              short pieces of thread.  These threads are subsequently woven                  
              in order into cloth.  The intersection points of the threads                   
              crossing each other in the cloth allows for discrete                           
              hybridization of all cloned DNAs separately and independently                  
              to all probes generated from the same set of clones and,                       
              therefore, allows for simultaneous determination of the                        
              overlap between all clones in the set.  The proposed method,                   
              if implemented, would be very powerful for its intended                        
              purpose and would reduce the clone ordering task into a                        
              simplified, standardized, and easily repeatable protocol.  In                  
              phase I work, we propose to try the method on the E.coli                       
              genome so that the procedure can be verified and optimized                     
              before attempting an entire human chromosome overlapping                       
              clone determination from a preexisting flow-sorted,                            
              chromosome-specific library.
