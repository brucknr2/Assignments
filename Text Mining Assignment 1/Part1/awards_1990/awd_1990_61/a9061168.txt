Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Liquid phase processing of ceramics, glass, semiconductors, and                
              oxide superconductors provides a route to producing useful forms               
              of these materials which is often blocked by reaction with                     
              containers.  This research explores a novel containerless                      
              processing method for these materials.  Heterogeneous nucleation               
              at container surfaces would be eliminated to enable synthesis of               
              amorphous materials and improve control of single crystal growth.              
              The containerless processing method uses relatively large                      
              aerodynamic forces and smaller acoustic positioning forces to                  
              achieve stable levitation of radiantly heated liquids.  Stable                 
              acoustic levitation of low density liquids such as water, as well              
              as aerodynamic levitation of dense solids, are well developed                  
              methods.  Application of the proposed hybrid technique to dense                
              solid materials has also been demonstrated in preliminary                      
              experiments under conditions for which aerodynamic levitation is               
              not, by itself, stable.  The proposed Phase I research develops                
              to maintain levitation stability during melting, demonstrates                  
              operation with selected ceramic materials (e.g., aluminum oxide,               
              oxide superconductors, fluoride glasses), and determines the                   
              designs and operating procedures for Phase II processing and                   
              materials property research.***//
