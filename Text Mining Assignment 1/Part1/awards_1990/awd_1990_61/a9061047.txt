Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  A new technique is being develop for minority isotope and                 
              trace element analysis on solid surfaces.  The apparatus is                    
              simple, reliable, and relatively inexpensive.  Direct recoiling                
              of surface atoms results in complete reduction to elemental ions.              
              Molecular isobaric interferences are eliminated yielding an                    
              uncomplicated mass spectrum.  Orders of magnitude improvement are              
              expected for the already demonstrated PPM sensitivity for U and                
              W.  We anticipate the simultaneously based on MSRI and secondary               
              ion mass spectrometry.
