Abstract    :
              Preliminary investigations indicate that acoustic radiation                    
              forces have the potential to give rise to new separation                       
              techniques.  Acoustic radiation and other acoustic forces                      
              generated at modest energy levels in the MHz frequency range                   
              are sufficiently strong to effectively move and concentrate                    
              suspended fine particles in aqueous systems.  In this proposed                 
              separation technique the forces causing the separation are                     
              only exerted upon the particle and not on the suspending                       
              medium, and separations can be achieved without the presence                   
              of apparatus in the fluid to be processed.  In                                 
              Phase I of the project the P.I. will determine particle and                    
              ultrasonic parameters necessary to achieve effective                           
              separation.  In Phase II, flow-through separators will be                      
              constructed and evaluated.  These separators will have                         
              application, for example, in the efficient removal of                          
              particulate contaminants in critical fluids used in                            
              semiconductor processing, and the manufacture of                               
              pharmaceuticals and thin-film adhesives.
