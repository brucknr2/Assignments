Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Exfluor Research Corporation has recently developed a                     
              technology for preparing mono- and di-basic perfluorocarboxylic                
              acids in very high yields.  The carboxylic acid functionality can              
              be converted to various other functionalities such as alcohols,                
              amines, halides, sulfonates, etc. which can then be used as                    
              fluorocarbon intermediates for the synthesis of high-performance               
              fluorelastomers.  This approach offers many advantages over the                
              more classical routes to fluorocarbon elastomers.  Namely,                     
              polymers made in this manner should be considerably less                       
              expensive.                                                                     
                   Efforts will be made to synthesize medium-molecular-weight                
              (800-5000) perfluoropolyether dibasic carboxylic acids using                   
              newly developed direct fluorination technology.  The research                  
              will focus on optimizing the fluorination conditions so that well              
              defined products can be obtained in high yields.  In order to                  
              accomplish this, side reactions leading to cross-linking, chain                
              degradation, and loss of acid functionality must be avoided.
