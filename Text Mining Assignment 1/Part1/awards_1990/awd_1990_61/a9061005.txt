Abstract    :
              There is a stated need for low-temperature processes                           
              for the deposition of semiconductor devices on top of                          
              insulators.  In particular, nonlinear devices are                              
              needed in the liquid crystal display industry in active                        
              matrix liquid crystal displays.  The maximum size of                           
              displays is limited in part by the difficulty in                               
              producing small, nonlinear devices over large area                             
              glass substrates.  This proposal addresses a possible                          
              solution to this problem:  the fabrication of                                  
              semiconductor devices through the use of a spin-                               
              coatable semiconducting polymer coating.  Previously,                          
              the insolubility of semiconducting polymer coating                             
              which is sufficiently soluble in organic solvents to                           
              produce spin-coated films of thicknesses from 0.1                              
              micron to 4 microns with a resistivity ranging from 10                         
              to 300 ohm cm.  The polymer is a substituted version                           
              of polyaniline.  We propose to determine the                                   
              feasibility of using Brewer Science's spin-coatable                            
              semiconducting polymer to make nonlinear electrical                            
              devices, such as diodes and thin film transistors, of                          
              the type that would be used in active matrix liquid                            
              crystal displays.  These devices could be used in other                        
              general applications as well.
