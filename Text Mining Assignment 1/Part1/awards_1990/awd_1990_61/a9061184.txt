Abstract    :
              Deep UV and I-line lithography will be used extensively throughout the         
              1990's to build submicron integrated circuits.  Recent studies with            
              commercial deep UV and I-line photoresists have shown that their               
              performance falls dramatically when printing over reflective                   
              substrates such as polysilicon and aluminum.  The formation of                 
              standing waves and stray reflections causes a severe loss of                   
              resolution and CD control.                                                     
                                                                                             
              The simplest approach for controlling reflectivity is to apply a light         
              absorbing polymer film, or antireflective coating (ARC), beneath the           
              resist.  ARCs have been used successfully for the past decade by chip          
              makers working at G-line.  The high absorptivity of the antireflective         
              coating is obtained by the addition of dyes to the polymer coating.            
                                                                                             
              To be compatible with submicron processing, antireflective coatings            
              for I-line and deep UV lithography must be extremely thin ( 0.1um) and         
              plasma etchable.  Obtaining adequate absorptivity with such thin films         
              is difficult using a conventional dye-filled polymer coating.  The             
              solution to this problem is to develop polymer coatings which are              
              intrinsically absorbing at the exposure wavelength.  This innovation           
              eliminates the need for dyes and allows the optical density of the ARC         
              to be increased.                                                               
                                                                                             
              During Phase I we will investigate the preparation of novel                    
              intrinsically absorbing polymers for I-line and deep UV ARC                    
              applications.  The polymer structures will be developed using results          
              from physical property determination and real life lithographic                
              testing.
