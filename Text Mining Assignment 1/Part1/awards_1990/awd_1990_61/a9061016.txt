Abstract    :
              A new device structure, a collinear asymmetrical directional coupler           
              using In2O3/InxSn1-xOy heterostructure thin film, is introduced which          
              will decrease the power consumption needed to obtain full intensity            
              modulation, is adaptable to any substrate, has a high multiplexing             
              capability, and will potentially give yield to a new line of both              
              electro-optic and all-optic devices.  Conventional coplanar                    
              directional couplers must have waveguides of exactly equal widths              
              which is extremely difficult to achieve.  We will eliminate the                
              stringent waveguide channel tolerance requirements through a variable          
              guided mode effective index technique.  Unlike the III-V and II-VI             
              compound semiconductor heterostructure, the In2O3/InxSn1-xOy film can          
              be grown on any surface.  Therefore, an active device can be built on          
              an array of substrate materials.  The In2O3/InxSn1-xOy has a                   
              transparent bandwidth from 400 nm to mid-infrared.  A large number of          
              optical wavelengths can also be multiplexed.                                   
                                                                                             
              Finally, the index modulation of In2O3/InxSn1-xSn1-xOy film is brought         
              about by carrier injection.  Consequently, both electro-optic and all          
              optical devices can be realized based on the novel concept.  The index         
              modulation with carrier injection is two orders of magnitude higher            
              than with the linear electro-optic effect.  The interaction length is          
              expected to be compatible with multi-quantum well devices.
