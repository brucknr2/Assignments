Abstract    :
              The development of a simple, efficient, nonchemistry-specific                  
              effluent treatment system would be of tremendous benefit to                    
              the semiconductor process industry.  The scrubber proposed in                  
              this SBIR project would remove reaction by-products from the                   
              process exhaust by condensation onto cryogenically cooled                      
              surfaces.  Once condensed as liquid or solid, the waste would                  
              be separated mechanically, nonhazardous material would be                      
              released, toxic material would be incinerated, and the ash                     
              collected for hazardous waste disposal.                                        
                                                                                             
              A secondary objective of the research is to examine the                        
              feasibility of using the (liquid) nitrogen as the working                      
              fluid of a heat engine, to extract waste heat as work from the                 
              gas stream.  The final goal of the research will be a                          
              commercial system which will liquefy air, separate out the                     
              oxygen from the nitrogen, condense and then incinerate the                     
              waste from industrial effluent, condense the waste from the                    
              incineration, and use the energy thus collected to liquefy                     
              more air.  Such a system may well be able to generate excess                   
              energy, as well as decrease toxic waste emissions.
