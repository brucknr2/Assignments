Abstract    :
              Infrared and ultraviolet image detection and processing requirements           
              have created an urgent need for high resolution and high gain                  
              frequency conversion mechanisms to shift wavelengths to the visible            
              regime.  Solid state imaging systems and optical processors for the            
              visible regime have approached the performance of the retina; in               
              contrast, their IR and UV counterparts suffer from high cost, poor             
              detectivity, and low resolution.  Optron Systems proposes to explore           
              the development of a Thin Film Optical Frequency Converter (TFOFC)             
              which can resolve, amplify, and convert infrared and ultraviolet               
              images to visible wavelengths for direct viewing, imaging, and optical         
              processing.  We intend to use a monolithic thin film sandwich                  
              structure that couples a visible-emitting electroluminescent film to a         
              photoconductive film with an optical gap tailored to the regime of             
              interest.  The principle of operation of the TFOFC involves using the          
              incident IR or UV radiation as a trigger and amplitude modulator for           
              the emission of visible light.  If successful, such a device could be          
              mass produced in large areas and at low cost and it would find                 
              immediate applications in, remote earth sensing, optical computing,            
              laser alignment, real-time image processing, machine vision,                   
              multispectral image fusion, edge detection, and astronomical imaging.
