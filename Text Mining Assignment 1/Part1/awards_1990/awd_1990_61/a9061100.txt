Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The objective in this project is to develop a method which                
              will permit the production of adherent, abrasion-resistant                     
              coating of Indium-Two Oxide (ITO) on plastic substrates.  It is                
              proposed that the desired goal be attained by use of a gradient                
              sublayer which gradually spans the gap in chemical and physical                
              properties between Indium-Two Oxide (ITO) and the organic                      
              substrate.  This gradient compositional sublayer will be                       
              deposited using radio frequency (RF) plasma polymerization and                 
              plasma sputtering techniques.  The proposed work is predicted on               
              the equipment availability and recent experiences with plasma                  
              polymerization studies in our laboratories as well as recent                   
              literature results demonstrating the surface metallization of                  
              plastic substrates using radio frequency (RF) plasma techniques.               
              The gradient sublayers employed will be ones which change                      
              gradually from 100% organic character to a metal oxide (e.g.,                  
              aluminum oxide A12O3) or non-metal oxide (e.g., silium dioxide                 
              SiO2) outer surface to which the Indium-Two Oxide (ITO) will be                
              bonded.  Preliminary studies in our laboratory using conventional              
              sublayer coating techniques are sufficiently promising to                      
              demonstrate the overall feasibility of the proposed research.                  
                   The development of a strongly adhesive, abrasion resistance               
              coating of Indium-Two Oxide (ITO) on plastic will open the door                
              to a variety of promising commercial possibilities.  Most                      
              important of these would be the production of all-plastic liquid-              
              crystal displays (LCDs) as well as new inexpensive plastics-based              
              keyboards.
