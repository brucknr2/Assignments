Abstract    :
              It is proposed a diagnostic method for the on-line, semi-                      
              continuous determination of the size and density of individual                 
              particles in the 5 nm to 100 nm size range.  This is                           
              accomplished through a double size spectrometry system.                        
              Particles are first sized by their Stokes diameter, and then                   
              sized by their aerodynamic diameter.  The Stokes diameter sizing               
              gives the geometric diameter of the particle for round particles.              
              The aerodynamic sizing is dependent on particle density as well                
              as Stokes diameter.  The result is a distribution of particle                  
              densities at each selected Stokes diameter.  The Stokes sizing                 
              is done by an electrical mobility separation, the aerodynamic                  
              sizing is done using a single-stage hypersonic impactor.                       
              Since particles are singly charged, the rate of particle                       
              capture in can be measured on-line using an electrometer.  The                 
              system is effective over the 5 to 100 nm diameter range.
