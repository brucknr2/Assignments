Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The utilization of phase shift between sensed output                      
              voltages from an approximately configured coil with a high                     
              permeability core is considered as the sensing element for a                   
              specific type of magnetometer.  Specifications are in terms of                 
              low cost, low power consumption, light weight and small size, and              
              sensitivity to low levels magnetic fields of .01 NT or less.  The              
              envisioned magnetometer would be utilized as a research tool in                
              various disciplines as well as having commercial applications in               
              navigational devices.
