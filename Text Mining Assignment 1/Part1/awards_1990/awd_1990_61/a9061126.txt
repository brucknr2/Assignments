Abstract    :
              Conventional refrigeration systems are limited in several                      
              respects:  neither vapor compression nor absorption coolers                    
              are efficient in small-scale units, and most vapor compression                 
              systems use freons (CFC's) that are harmful to the                             
              environment.  Thermoelectric cooler have been used in a small                  
              scale, applications, but also suffer from low efficiency.  A                   
              cooling device which offers higher efficiency in a small scale                 
              unit, and which avoids the use of CFC's, would be highly                       
              desirable.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              To meet these criteria, TDA plans to look at a novel cooling                   
              device using coupled electrochemical oxidation and reduction.                  
              After carrying out detailed thermodynamic calculations to                      
              define the system and the desired characteristics of the                       
              coupled reactions, they have identified a number of promising                  
              reaction sets.  However, detailed data on many of the                          
              desirable chemical systems are not available.  Accordingly,                    
              the objectives of the research are (1) to carry out                            
              measurements of the fundamental electrochemical parameters of                  
              redox couples that are potentially useful in such a process,                   
              and (2) to conduct a systems analysis to determine the                         
              performance of a device based on these reactions.                              
              Theoretically, the electrochemical cycle operates at the same                  
              Coefficient of Performance (COP) as a Carnot refrigerator;                     
              however, real equipment considerations will limit performance                  
              to about 40% of the Carnot limit.  The refrigerator has                        
              potential for several applications, including replacement of                   
              refrigerators with CFC's and small scale cooling such as a                     
              chiller for electronic components.  In Phase II they will                      
              construct and test a prototype cooling device using this                       
              approach.
