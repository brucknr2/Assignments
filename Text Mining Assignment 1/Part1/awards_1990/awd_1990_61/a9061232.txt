Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Routine bulk quantitative analysis of rocks and minerals                  
              presents unique problems.  Many of the analytical techniques                   
              currently used for this purpose require extensive sample                       
              preparation involving dissolution of the material in question.                 
              This is unsatisfactory since it potentially introduces errors                  
              resulting from additional sample handling and preferential                     
              dissolution of some analytes.  Glow discharge mass spectrometry                
              (GDMD) utilizing a direct current discharge source overcomes the               
              problem of sample preparation because it a direct solid sampling               
              technique.  There are however, no commercially available GDMS                  
              instruments which can analyze insulating samples such as                       
              geological materials without first mixing them with a conducting               
              binder.  This practice is undesirable since it reduces the                     
              sensitivity of the measurement, and introduces potential spectral              
              interferences.  Using a GDMS instrument employing an rf                        
              discharge source provides the analyst with the means to directly               
              analyze nonconducting samples with little or no sample                         
              preparation, and minimal matrix dependency.
