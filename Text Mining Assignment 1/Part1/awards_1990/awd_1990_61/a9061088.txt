Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The use of perovskites such as BaTiO3 as thin film ferroelectric               
              materials in microelectronics and photonics has been limited by                
              materials processing and compatibility problems.  High quality                 
              ferroelectric thin films have not been grown at temperatures                   
              compatible with stand Si or GaAs processing technology.                        
              Considering the superb electrical and optical properties of these              
              materials as well as their potential for use in the production of              
              low cost DRAMs and non-volatile memory devices, the development                
              of new thin film deposition techniques capable of producing high               
              quality ferroelectric thin films at low temperatures is                        
              especially important.  Utilizing techniques recently developed at              
              ATM for the deposition of high temperature superconductors by                  
              metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD), a novel plasma-                
              enhanced MOCVD process for the deposition of BaTiO3 at                         
              temperatures compatible with silicon processing is proposed.  The              
              specific goal of the Phase I program is to deposit a-axis                      
              oriented BaTi03 thin films on Si(100) at temperatures below 650oC              
              by plasma enhanced MOCVD.  Prototype random access memory devices              
              based on BaTiO3 ferroelectric capacitor storage cells will be                  
              fabricated and tested in Phase II.  Lifetimes in excess of 1012                
              write/read/invert accesses and power-off memory retention over                 
              one year, which represent a significant improvement over state-                
              of-the-art ferroelectric memory cells, are targeted.
