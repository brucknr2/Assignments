Abstract    :
              The objective of this program is to select low cost, light weight              
              materials transmitting in the infrared and then to design optical              
              components, and coatings that are required for infrared                        
              detection.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              The investigations will be directed towards the review of                      
              material technologies such as Ge-based chalcogenides and plastics              
              to achieve the selection goal of both low cost and light weight.               
              The experimental program will be directed towards gaining insight              
              into the evaluation of transmission properties, hardness factors,              
              humidity and chemical attack tolerance.  The eligible material                 
              will be coated, to obtain transparent or semi-transparent                      
              components.  Tests such as adhesion, humidity, salt spray,                     
              scratch, will be carried out in order to determine optical and                 
              mechanical quality of the coated components.                                   
                                                                                             
              The results obtained during this program can substantially reduce              
              the cost of the detection system assemblies over currently                     
              available ones that use expensive materials such as AnSe, AnS,                 
              Ge, GaAs.  considerable cost economies can be obtained by                      
              combining, for example, plastic optical elements with other                    
              stronger material.  Plastics and chalcogenides can offer high                  
              performance if they are used in the areas of their capabilities.               
              The commercialization of these inexpensive optics will benefit                 
              the entire optical community.
