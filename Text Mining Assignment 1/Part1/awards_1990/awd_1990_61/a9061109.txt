Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The objective of this SBIR Phase I program is to test the                      
              application of the Edge-defined, Film-fed, Growth process (EFG)                
              to growth of refractory oxide eutectic fibers.  Work is directed               
              to producing a range of microstructures in the grown fibers by                 
              variation of growth process parameters.  These results may be                  
              expected to indicate directions for process and fiber property                 
              optimization.  The eutectic fiber produced by this technique will              
              find application in both ceramic-and metal-matrix composite                    
              structures for high-temperature service.
