Abstract    :
              The large scale use of photovoltaic-generated electricity                      
              hinges on the cost if its production.  Thin film amorphous                     
              silicon is emerging as the next generation solar cell material                 
                                                                                             
              with commercial potential.  The progress in amorphous silicon                  
              technology has been rapid enough that it is presently at the                   
              manufacturing stage.  The commercial method for the production                 
                                                                                             
              of amorphous silicon is the glow discharge method, using                       
              silane as the feed-stock.  Photochemical methods are an                        
              alternate, potentially more cost efficient, method to prepare                  
              amorphous silicon.                                                             
                                                                                             
              This project is a systematic study of the photolysis of                        
              silanes in the condensed phase ("ice"), with a view to                         
              producing amorphous and polycrystalline silicon.  The emphasis                 
                                                                                             
              will be on adapting the condensed phase photolysis for the                     
              preparation of semiconductor grade amorphous and crystalline                   
              silicon, with the ultimate objective of scaling up the method                  
              to a manufacturing process for silicon solar cells.  The                       
              method has the advantage of easily incorporating any desired                   
              dopant by making the latter a co-condensate of the silane                      
              host.  It has the promise of gentler preparation conditions,                   
              compared to the glow-discharge method, thus producing a better                 
                                                                                             
              quality semiconductor.
