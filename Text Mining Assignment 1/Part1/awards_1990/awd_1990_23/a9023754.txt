Abstract    :
              This project will supply shipboard scientific equipment for the                
              research vessels MELVILLE, WASHINGTON, NEW HORIZON, and R. G.                  
              SPROUL, operated by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, and               
              dedicated to use in support of ocean science research.                         
                                                                                             
              The Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment Program provides funds              
              for ship equipment deemed essential to the proper and safe                     
              conduct of ocean science research. This Program provides support               
              for such items as deck equipment including winch systems for the               
              deployment and retrieval of scientific instruments, navigational               
              equipment such as radars, gyroscopes and earth satellite                       
              receivers to pin point the location of research sites,                         
              communication equipment including radio transceivers and                       
              satellite transceivers for voice and scientific data                           
              communications and other equipment such as motorized workboats                 
              for transporting scientists to and from data retrieval sites.                  
                                                                                             
              The Project Director, George G. Shor is fully qualified to direct              
              this project having had considerable experience in overseeing the              
              acquisition and installation of shipboard equipment.                           
                                                                                             
              This project will allow the institution to upgrade navigational                
              equipment on the WASHINGTON and SPROUL, add navigation computer                
              systems on the WASHINGTON and NEW HORIZON, improve communication               
              systems between the MELVILLE, the WASHINGTON and the base station              
              and acquire a weatherfax and safe air detector for the NEW                     
              HORIZON.
