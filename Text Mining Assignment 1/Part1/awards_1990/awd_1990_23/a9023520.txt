Abstract    :
                   The PI plans studies involving Roman analysis of gas mixtures,            
              applied studies on ore-deposit geology and collaborative work to               
              bridge the gap between analytical, experimental and theoretical                
              approaches to fluid-rock interactions, especially in the context               
              of how ore deposits form and alteration occurs.  Fluid inclusion               
              analysis of natural minerals and experimental analogs provide                  
              incite into the composition and specification of fluids derived                
              from igneous and metamorphic environments, as well as the                      
              mineralizing P-T conditions.  Experimental and theoretical studies             
              of fluid compositions at elevated T&P, designed to initiate natural            
              fluid evolution, provide model data and constraints to natural                 
              systems.  Field emphasis of this work will involve the rocks of the            
              Duluth Complex.
