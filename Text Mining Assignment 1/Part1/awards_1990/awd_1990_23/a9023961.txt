Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              The US Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (US JGOFS) seeks "to                      
              understand the processes governing the production and fate of                  
              biogenic material in the sea well enough to predict their                      
              influences on, and responses to global scale perturbations"                    
              (JGOFS, 1984                                                                   
              "identifying and quantifying the physical, chemical and                        
              biological processes controlling biogeochemical cycling in the                 
              ocean, and their interaction with the global atmosphere" (JGOFS,               
              1984,                                                                          
              achieving a predictive capability is that the processes and                    
              interactions quantified today respond linearly to global scale                 
              perturbations and that knowledge of the present biogeochemical                 
              system dynamics will, therefore, allow us to predict response to               
              global perturbations with accuracy.  This is a fundamental                     
              assumption and is the keystone of the JGOFS strategy for                       
              predictive capability.  The scientific justification for this                  
              assumption has never been stated.
