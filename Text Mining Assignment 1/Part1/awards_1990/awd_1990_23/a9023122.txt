Abstract    :
                   Robotics as a new technology has revolutionized many                      
              industries: robots build cars, assemble watches andcomputers, and              
              cooperate in large-scale construction work.  Soon, cars may                    
              actually be robots.  This industrial revolution has reawakened                 
              interest in many old philosophical issues about the nature of the              
              mental and its relation to the world -- as well as some new ones               
              about what kind of mental states of a robot, if any, can be said to            
              constitute knowledge of its world, and the extent to which such                
              knowledge must be legitimized by reference to the robot's                      
              interactions with human knowers.                                               
                   This workshop will bring together a number of people from                 
              Several disciplines (e.g., philosophy, psychology, computer science,           
              cognitive science) to address these issues in the light of recent              
              work on constructivist approaches to AI, multi-agent artifacts and             
              human-machine interaction.
