Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This project studies public support for democracy in Germany              
              as democratic institutions spread throughout the recently reuni-               
              ted country.  It constitutes the first nation-wide opinion survey              
              conducted after the December, 1990, all-German elections.   These              
              data will be combined with data from surveys in March, 1990, and               
              from the late 1940s to estimate and assess a model of deter-                   
              minants of pro-democratic attitudes.  Some factors whose impact                
              will be assessed are the political structure of opposition                     
              parties, historical factors, indirect influences from West to                  
              East, economics, political socialization, and nationalist or                   
              neutralist sentiments.  Data collection will be by the Institut                
              fur Demoskopie, and the project involves a high degree of coop-                
              eration between American and German social scientists.
