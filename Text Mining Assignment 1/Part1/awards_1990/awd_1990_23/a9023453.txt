Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The NSF Awards for Women Scientists and Engineers recognizes              
              the high quality of the awardee's record in teaching and                       
              scholarship, as well as potential for continued significant                    
              contributions to scientific research, the academic profession,                 
              and the education of future scientists and engineers. Dr.                      
              Williams's research under this award is in morphological aspects               
              of solid surfaces.                                                             
                   The morphology of solid surfaces, e.g., their structure on a              
              scale of nanometers to microns, is the governing factor in a                   
              range of practical processes including crystal growth, epitaxy                 
              and etching. To understand these processes, it is first necessary              
              to understand both the thermodynamics and kinetics of surface                  
              morphology, which are in turn governed by the behavior of surface              
              steps. Direct measurements of step behavior, designed to allow                 
              quantitative analysis in terms of statistical mechanical                       
              predictions, will be performed using diffraction and imaging                   
              techniques.  This grant will be used to foster excellence in this              
              research by supporting: 1) development and application of state-               
              of-the-art experimental capabilities to allow measurements in                  
              previously unexplored areas, and 2) direct interaction with                    
              theorists to insure that experiments are relevant to outstanding               
              questions of theory.                                                           
                   Within the broad criteria listed above, the systems to be                 
              studied will be chosen to have practical materials significance.               
              Examples of relevant problems are the formation of quantum wires,              
              the oxidative etching of Si, and the faceting of metals surfaces               
              under adsorption of chemical reactants.
