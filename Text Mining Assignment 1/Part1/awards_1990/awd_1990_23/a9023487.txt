Abstract    :
              High performance, high productivity machines often show excessive              
              vibration and noise, low reliability and life, and poor                        
              precision.   New analytical methods for their design are required              
              to improve their performance.  This project deals with the                     
              development of more complete, computationally practical, dynamic               
              analysis methods for the design of such machines.  The research                
              addresses machine spatial dynamics, the dynamics effects of                    
              clearances in connections, the dynamics effects of distributed                 
              mass and compliance of machine links, the dynamics effects of                  
              supporting structures and enclosures, the effects of fastening                 
              methods used in fabrication, and control systems and actuators.                
              The analytical models will be tested experimentally as they are                
              developed.
