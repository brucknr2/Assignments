Abstract    :
                   This Faculty Award for Women Scientists and Engineers is                  
              made to Dr. Margaret Cheney of the Department of Mathematical                  
              Sciences, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.  Dr. Cheney will                   
              continue her work in the area of Applied Mathematics concerned                 
              with multidimensional inverse problems.  In particular she is                  
              interested in finding the electrical properties of the interior                
              of a body from measurements made on the boundary.                              
                   The NSF Faculty Award for Women recognizes the high quality               
              of the awardee's record in teaching and scholarship as well as                 
              potential for continued significant contributions to scientific                
              research, the academic profession, and the education of future                 
              scientists.  Dr. Cheney will continue her work in the area of                  
              Applied Mathematics concerned with multidimensional inverse                    
              problems.  Particularly noteworthy is her involvement with                     
              recruitment of women for full fellowships.
