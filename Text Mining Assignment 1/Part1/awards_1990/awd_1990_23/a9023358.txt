Abstract    :
                   The Diatom Herbarium of the Academy of Natural Sciences,                  
              Philadelphia contains more than 110,000 catalogued specimen slides,            
              224,000 uncatalogued lots, card files for 4,500 type specimens,                
              60,000 localities, 160,000 taxon occurrences, 51,000 bibliographic             
              citations, and 200,000 unprocessed samples, making it the largest              
              collection of its type in the western hemisphere.  Dr. Edward                  
              Theriot, Curator in charge of the Herbarium, plans continued                   
              improvement in the physical preservation of specimens, especially              
              type specimens, for use in pure and applied research.                          
                   Diatoms are a diverse group of phytoplankton that are widely              
              used as environmental indicators, and are the subjects on many                 
              biostratigraphic and evolutionary studies.  Systematic collections             
              of fossil and modern diatoms are essential to this research, and               
              the Diatom Herbarium in Philadelphia is one of the world's most                
              important collections of its type.  Future research on global                  
              climate change, evolutionary processes, and environmental quality              
              will rely on the continued growth and improvement of systematic                
              collections such as this.
