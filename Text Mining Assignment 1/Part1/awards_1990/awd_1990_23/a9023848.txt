Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The Materials Research Laboratory (MRL) at the University of              
              Massachusetts - Amherst supports interactive, interdisciplinary                
              research in polymer science and engineering organized into three               
              major thrust areas.                                                            
                   Thrust research on pattern formation in polymer systems has               
              evolved from earlier work in the MRL on polymer blends.  It                    
              focusses on structure and pattern formation in multiphase polymer              
              systems, including both blends and liquid crystals.  Researchers               
              in the thrust area on polymers in restricted geometries are                    
              synthesizing and characterizing novel polymeric films and                      
              surfaces, investigating their corresponding properties, and                    
              studying polymer adsorption processes.  A new thrust on ordered                
              polymeric solids is devoted to novel approaches to polymer                     
              synthesis, characterization of new periodic polymer morphologies,              
              processing and property prediction.  A major emphasis is placed                
              on novel polymers of precisely defined structure produced by                   
              incorporating biochemical techniques into the synthetic                        
              procedures.                                                                    
                   The MRL also supports the development, maintenance and                    
              operation of central research facilities for characterization,                 
              morphology and rheology determination, spectroscopy, and                       
              computation.  It also provides seed funding for exploratory                    
              research and new initiatives in materials research, and supports               
              programs to foster increased participation by minorities and to                
              provide experience in polymer research for undergraduates.  The                
              research program currently involves 19 faculty members from four               
              departments, 3 postdoctoral research associates, 19 graduate                   
              students and 15 undergraduates, and supporting technical and                   
              clerical staff.  The MRL at the University of Massachusetts,                   
              Amherst is directed by Professor David A. Tirrell.
