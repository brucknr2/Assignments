Abstract    :
              A program-development workshop on ocean engineering,                           
              marine biotechnology and mariculture will be held in Santa                     
              Barbara, or some other suitable location.  The workshop                        
              will draw on expertise from the Institut Francais de                           
              Recherche pour L'exploitation de la Mer (IFREMER), the                         
              Marine Biological Station, Roscoff and the new French,                         
              Mediterranean Institute of Technology (MIT), as well as                        
              that from U.S. Institutions (University of California,                         
              Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of                       
              Maryland, the University of Hawaii and others).  The goal                      
              of the workshop will be to review recent research in ocean                     
              engineering and marine biotechnology in the U.S. and                           
              France, in order to explore possible synergistic                               
              relationships that might be developed between ocean                            
              engineers and marine biotechnologists in France and the                        
              United States.  We will define innovative new research                         
              goals for the future.  A summary and report will be                            
              prepared by French and U.S. organizers, entitled, "Ocean                       
              Engineering, Marine Biotechnology and Mariculture--A                           
              Franco-American Perspective."
