Abstract    :
                   Infrared remote sensing techniques are routinely used as a                
              means of obtaining data on the concentration and altitude                      
              distribution of atmospheric trace constituents.                                
              The PIs propose to conduct a series of balloon flights to                      
              obtain high spectral resolution atmospheric transmission and                   
              emission data in various spectral intervals from 100 cm-1 to 3000              
              cm-1.  The transmission data will be obtained from the ground                  
              through 40 km  and from 40 km during solar occultation, at a                   
              resolution of 0.002 cm-1 (unapodized).  The emission data will be              
              obtained over the same altitude range and in a limb viewing mode               
              at a resolution of .04 cm-1.  The data will be analyzed to obtain              
              constituent profiles for compounds of stratospheric interest with              
              higher absolute accuracy than in previous studies.  The                        
              concentrations measured in this program will be compared with                  
              earlier data for detection of possible trends.  The spectra will               
              also be compared with calculations using the latest versions of                
              the HITRAN database.  These comparisons are particularly                       
              important for improving our ability to accurately calculate the                
              atmospheric radiative transfer.
