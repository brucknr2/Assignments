Abstract    :
                   This action will provide funds for a new faculty member,                  
              research associates and students at Syracuse University to                     
              pursue experiments in elementary particle physics.  The focus                  
              of the research will be on the study of the properties of heavy                
              quarks, particularly the b-quark.  These experiments will be                   
              performed at the Cornell Electron Storage Ring (CESR) and in                   
              the out years of the grant, perhaps other accelerator                          
              facilities.  These experiments are a sensitive test of the                     
              currently accepted "Standard Model" of the electroweak                         
              interactions.
