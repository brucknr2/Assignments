Abstract    :
              Past research has developed suitable parameterizations for edges,              
              planes, circular and cylindrical features that, in combination with            
              linear and nonlinear least squares fits, allow statistical                     
              estimates of many geometric tolerances (form position, orientation,            
              location) as well as conventional direct tolerances.  In addition,             
              offline programming capability from a CAD data base for 2D                     
              inspection tasks has been developed.  This research will now be                
              extended to accomplish the following objectives:  develop a                    
              sequential sampling methodology and a cost model for determining               
              acceptability of a part; develop methods for correctly estimating              
              part datums; incorporate systematic feature deviations and machine             
              error; extend the methodologies to other features such as                      
              sculptured surfaces and composite tolerances; develop methods for              
              probe selection, part fixturing and orientation; investigate the               
              use of the PDES/STEP standards in support of automatic offline                 
              programming; and implement and test the methods utilizing the                  
              tactile and optical CMM's in the Manufacturing Quality Lab, and                
              apply them to both part inspection and process control.
