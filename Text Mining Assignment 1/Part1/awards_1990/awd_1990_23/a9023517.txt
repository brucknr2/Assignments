Abstract    :
              The chemical character of complexes between organic hosts and                  
              guests will be studied.  The research will focus on the                        
              incarceration of guests in rigidly hollow hosts either without                 
              holes (carcerands) or with holes (hemicarcerands) in their                     
              shells.  The free energies of constrictive binding by                          
              hemicarceplexes will be measured for both aliphatic and                        
              aromatic guests in the molecular weight range of about 80-120.                 
              The rates of complexation and decomplexation will be correlated                
              with the relative sizes of the guests and portals in                           
              hemicarceplexes.  Comparisons will be made between the rates                   
              and products of reactions run in the interior phases of                        
              dissolved demicarceplexes, and those run in the same solvents                  
              free of the hosts.  Guests will be designed, prepared, and                     
              studied, only a part of which can be incarcerated, the rest                    
              being too large to pass through the portals of the hosts.  A                   
              small molecular tether will connect the two parts.  Other                      
              guests will be studied, one part of which will be contained in                 
              one hemicarcerand and a second part in a second hemicarcerand.                 
              The product will be two hemicarceplexes connected by a short                   
              molecular tether.  New families of carcerands and                              
              hemicarcerands will be designed and synthesized.                               
                                                                                             
              The Organic Synthesis Program is funding the renewal of this                   
              Nobel Prize research.  It will continue its development of the                 
              chemistry of small molecules imprisoned inside larger                          
              molecules.  The work has the potential to lead to very unique                  
              new patterns of reactivity.
