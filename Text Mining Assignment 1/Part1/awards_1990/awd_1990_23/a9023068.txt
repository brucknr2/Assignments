Abstract    :
                   The Web Handling Research Center at Oklahoma State University             
              has been a very viable and successful I/UCRC since 1985.  The                  
              Center's research concentrates on "Webs", which are materials that             
              are manufactured and processed in continuous flexible, strip form,             
              and includes paper, plastics, textiles, metals, and composites.                
              Web technology is used in almost every continuous process industry             
              in some way.  The Center's research efforts are in the areas of:               
              1) longitudinal dynamics; 2) lateral dynamics; 3) winding and                  
              unwinding; 4) wrinkling; 5) measurement of physical properties, and            
              6) control strategies.                                                         
                   The Center has grown to 15 corporate sponsors, and has                    
              received a grant of $900,000 over six years from the Noble                     
              Foundation for equipment and graduate fellowship support.  The                 
              Center has used its Industrial Advisory Board very effectively over            
              its lifetime to help define and direct its research, and recently              
              began to concentrate efforts on technology transfer.  These efforts            
              have included seminars in sponsors' plants and a live interactive              
              satellite-delivered teleconference delivered to the Center                     
              sponsors.  The Center is clearly an effective I/UCRC Center and                
              meets all the requirements for the program.  The Program Manager               
              recommends that Oklahoma State University be awarded $33,000 for               
              the first year of a three-year, Self-Sufficient Partnership for                
              Research, $8,000 for the support of an evaluator in the Center for             
              one year, and $10,000 for the support of two female undergraduate              
              students under the "Funding for Support for Woman, Minority, and               
              Disabled Engineering Research Assistants, for a total of $51,000.              
                   Near the end of each 12-month period, the Program Manager                 
              and/or the Division Director of the Engineering Centers Division               
              will review the progress of the Center on a number of criteria,                
              including the following:  1) extent to which University/Industry               
              interaction and collaboration is developing; 2) extent to which the            
              support base for the Center is expanding; 3) extent to which robust            
              research program is developing.  If the review is satisfactory, the            
              Program Manager will recommend support of the next period of this              
              continuing grant.
