Abstract    :
              The research focus is to be in two specific research areas.  These             
              are the modeling of microbial transformations of organic chemicals             
              in the saturated and unsaturated soil zones and the modeling of                
              processes controlling the interphase mass partitioning of                      
              contaminants in subsurface systems.
