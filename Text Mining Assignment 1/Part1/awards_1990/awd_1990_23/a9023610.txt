              The primary objective of this workshop is to bring together                    
              Polish and U.S. sociologists, political scientists,                            
              economists, and social psychologists to design longitudinal                    
              research projects on the reconciliation of self-interest                       
              of individuals with national collective interests in an                        
              emerging democracy.  Dr. Robert Zajonc of the University                       
              of Michigan and Dr. Miroslaw Kofta of the Polish Institute

              evaluate proposed longitudinal designs, standardized                           
              measures, uniform data collection and management processes                     
              as well as linguistic equivalence for follow-on joint                          
              projects to be carried out in Poland and the United                            
              States.  Resulting proposals for research support are
