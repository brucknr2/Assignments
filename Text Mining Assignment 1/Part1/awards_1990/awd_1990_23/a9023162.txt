Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project addresses fundamental processes and atomic level                  
              details of chemical reactions, transport phenomena, and epitaxial              
              crystal growth underlying metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy(MOVPE)              
              of advanced III-V compound semiconductor structures.  A major                  
              emphasis is on insitu monitoring of the crystal growth surface, and            
              understanding the basic surface growth kinetics that dominate the              
              increasingly common low pressure MOVPE regime.  Fourier transform              
              infrared(FTIR) spectroscopy will be used to study adsorption                   
              processes and surface kinetics of organometallic source compounds;             
              extension to on-line process diagnostics in feedback control of                
              atomic layer epitaxy  processes will also be explored.  An MOVPE               
              reactor equipped with a recording microbalance will be used to                 
              directly measure growth kinetics of compound semiconductors.  The              
              information gained from these studies will form the basis for                  
              development of detailed models of the surface growth kinetics.                 
              These models will then be incorporated into existing MOVPE reactor             
              models and tested against experimental MOVPE crystal growth data.
