Abstract    :
              This study is part of an ongoing project on the economics of                   
              airline hub-and-spoke networks. To date, work has focused on how               
              airline fares in an individual city-pair market are related to the             
              characteristics of the hub-and-spoke network serving the market.               
              Empirical findings suggest that, by allowing airlines to exploit               
              economies of traffic density, networks reduce airlines costs and               
              thereby lower the fares charged to passengers.                                 
                                                                                             
              Several extensions of this work are pursued in this project. A                 
              version of the model will be estimated where spoke traffic levels              
              replace network characteristics in the regression equation. With               
              economies of density, high traffic levels on the spokes connecting             
              the cities in a given market should lead to low fares. Spoke                   
              traffic levels, however, must be treated as endogenous, being                  
              determined in part by network characteristics, Second, a structural            
              model of network traffic determination will be estimated that                  
              allows the parameters of the airlines cost function to be                      
              identified. The estimates should indicate the actual magnitude of              
              economies of traffic density. Finally, the impact of the TWA-Ozark             
              and Northwest-Republic mergers on the fares paid by connecting                 
              passengers at the St. Louis and Minneapolis hubs will be estimated.            
              Simulations based on previous empirical estimates suggest that                 
              these fares should have fallen in response to the mergers.
