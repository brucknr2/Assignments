Abstract    :
                   This investigation is based primarily on the analysis of                  
              existing energetic particle observations from detectors on IMP-8,              
              ISEE-1, ISEE/3/ICE spacecraft in the interplanetary medium near                
              Earth, and from detectors on the Voyager deep space probes.                    
              Specific studies to be undertaken include:                                     
                                                                                             
                   1.  Solar Flare Particle Acceleration.  Sensors on IMP,                   
                   ISEE, Helios, and Voyager spacecraft have collected data                  
                   that will be combined to construct particle spectral forms                
                   over ~2.5 decades of energy to test spectral predictions of               
                   acceleration models.                                                      
                                                                                             
                   2.  Interplanetary Shock Accleration.  Energetic particle,                
                   plasma and field data from the ISEE/ICE and Voyager                       
                   spacecraft will be used to probe the sites and mechanisms of              
                   particle accleration by (a) examining the role, if any, of                
                   shock acceleration in solar particle event decay phases, (b)              
                   constructing broad energy spectra for heavy nuclei in co-                 
                   rotating interaction regions observed at both 1 and 4 AU,                 
                   (c) searching for electron acceleration at both quasi-                    
                   parallel and quasi-perpendicular shocks, and (d) examining                
                   water group ion spectra over a broad velocity range for the               
                   1985 observations near comet Giacobini-Zinner.                            
                                                                                             
                   3.  Particle Transport.  Data from several spacecraft will                
                   be used to (a) study the transport of 10-20 MeV protons over              
                   different radial distances from the sun, (b) investigate the              
                   relation between sunward anisotropies of ~1 MeV/nucleon                   
                   particles in solar flare event decay phases with topological              
                   features of the interplanetary magnetic field, and (c) test               
                   simple models of particle scattering using energetic                      
                   particle, field, and plasma observations near interplanetary              
                   shocks.
