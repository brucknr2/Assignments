Abstract    :
              Dr. Dutcher's research program has two primary aims.  First, the               
              study of the function, morphogenesis, and inheritance of                       
              centrioles/basal bodies and second, the study of the regulation of             
              amino acid metabolism.  The unicellular, eukaryotic green alga,                
              Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is being used as a model system.  In                 
              Chlamydomonas it is possible to analyze cellular processes using               
              genetic, biochemical, cytological and molecular techniques.  The               
              approach is to isolate mutations that disrupt a process of interest            
              and to study the mutant phenotypes using a barrage of methods to               
              gain an understanding of the process.                                          
                                                                                             
              This proposal fulfills the FAW objectives which are 1) to recognize            
              outstanding and promising women scientists and engineers in                    
              academic careers of research and teaching and 2) to facilitate the             
              further development of their careers.***//
