Abstract    :
                 Dr. Anderson is a leading investigator in the area of molecular             
              genetics of pattern formation in Drosophila.  Her work focuses on              
              the role of the dorsal group genes, Easter and Toll.  The question             
              addressed is whether the Toll protein is a receptor, and what the              
              ligand and effector for Toll are.                                              
                                                                                             
              This award is a National Science Foundation Faculty Award for Women            
              Scientists and Engineers.  The proposal fulfills the FAW                       
              objectives, which are: 1, to recognize outstanding and promising               
              women scientists and engineers in academic careers of research and             
              teaching and 2, to facilitate the further development of their                 
              careers.
