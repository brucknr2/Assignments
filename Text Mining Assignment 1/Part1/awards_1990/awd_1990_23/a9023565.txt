Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports exploratory research on the political and legal            
              culture of the Soviet Union.  The political culture of the Soviet              
              Union is experiencing profound strains.  In part, these are the                
              cause, and in part an effect, of the dramatic convulsions taking               
              place in the politics of that country as it attempts the difficult             
              transition from authoritarian government and socialist economy to              
              democracy and markets.  This research examines the linkages between            
              public opinion, political change, and the process of                           
              democratization.                                                               
                                                                                             
              This project is structured around national surveys of public                   
              opinion and political elite attitudes to be conducted in the Soviet            
              Union in mid-1991.  The research will provide the basis for                    
              developing a profile of the major attributes of Soviet legal and               
              political culture, permit the testing of hypotheses about the                  
              origins of and recent changes in Soviet values, and facilitate                 
              comparisons of the differences in value content and structure                  
              between the Soviet Union, Western Europe and the United States.                
                                                                                             
              When completed this research will provide valuable evidence for                
              understanding the changes underway in the Soviet Union.  It should             
              facilitate assessments of the distance the Soviet Union has                    
              traveled down the road to democracy and whether it is likely to                
              continue moving along that road.  More generally, this research                
              should help us understand the role of political culture in                     
              processes of democratization and global change.
