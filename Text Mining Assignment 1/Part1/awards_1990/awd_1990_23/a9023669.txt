Abstract    :
              The significance of the proposed research is that it is the first              
              chance sea ice ecologists have of obtaining time series data on                
              microbial biomass accumulation, growth rates and productivity in               
              the Antarctic pack ice ecosystem.  This information is essential               
              to understanding overall Southern Ocean productivity.  Pack ice                
              covers 20 million square kilometers of the surface of the                      
              Southern Ocean.  Because of the multi-disciplinary nature of the               
              AnZone project, Dr. Sullivan proposes to investigate primary                   
              production and factors that influence the growth and development               
              of microalgal and bacterial assemblages with the first and second              
              year pack ice.  AnZone project is an international cooperative                 
              program located in western Weddell Sea.  The research planned                  
              under the AnZone project will contribute substantially to                      
              understanding biological rate processes in sea ice.                            
              Additionally, Dr. Sullivan proposes to examine indicators of                   
              natural cell metabolism as indices of natural growth of pack ice               
              microalgae.  Throughout these investigations, Dr. Sullivan will                
              test the hypothesis that a substantial fraction of primary and                 
              secondary productivity within the ice covered region of the                    
              Southern Ocean occurs within the pack ice and that it is mediated              
              by microalgae and bacteria associated with the extensive ice                   
              crystal surfaces of the pack ice habitat.
