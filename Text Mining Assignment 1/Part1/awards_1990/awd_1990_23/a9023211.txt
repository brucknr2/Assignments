Abstract    :
                   This award will support in part the 1991 Aspen Winter                     
              Elementary Particle Physics Conference; Aspen Colorado; January                
              6-12, 1991.  This conference is devoted to the "physics at                     
              higher luminosity".  The conference will cover the latest                      
              results from LEP (CERN Switzerland) experiments on the physics                 
              of the Z boson and their implications for the so called                        
              "standard model" of electroweak interactions.  Among others,                   
              sessions will cover the properties of the Z and W bosons,                      
              search for the top quark, b quark physics, c quark physics,                    
              precision electroweak physics and facilities and detectors for                 
              high luminosity.
