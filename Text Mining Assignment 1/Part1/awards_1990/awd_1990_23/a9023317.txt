Abstract    :
                   A pair of large multilayer reflectors will be designed and                
              fabricated, one to operate just above, and one just below the K-               
              edge of iodine for application to dual-energy subtraction                      
              angiography using synchrotron radiation.  The specular-angular                 
              responses at the K-edge will be measured, and the performance                  
              will be analyzed in a synchrotron angiography beam line, in this               
              Phase II program.  Additional studies of fabrication parameters                
              will be carried out with a view of optimizing reflectivity.
