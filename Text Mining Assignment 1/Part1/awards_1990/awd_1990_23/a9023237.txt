Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              With a Faculty Award for Women Scientists and Engineers from the               
              National Science Foundation, Dr. Gail Mandel will continue to                  
              investigate the basis of regulated expression of sodium channel                
              genes in the nervous system.  Presently, Dr. Mandel is focusing                
              on the molecular events leading to the first appearance of sodium              
              channels in the developing embryonic nervous system.  This                     
              examination will determine whether cell-cell interactions are                  
              critical for the initial activation of sodium channel gene                     
              expression and, if so, how signals are transmitted to the                      
              nucleus.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              The importance of molecular studies on channel genes may extend                
              to other genes involved in commitment to the neuronal pathway,                 
              having a major impact on the field of molecular neurobiology in                
              general and the understanding of ion channel regulation in                     
              particular.
