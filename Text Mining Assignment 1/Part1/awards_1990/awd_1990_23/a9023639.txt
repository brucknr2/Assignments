Abstract    :
              The widespread belief that science and imaginative literature are              
              "two cultures," incommensurable ways to different kinds of                     
              knowledge, emerged in the 19th century, breaking up the                        
              Enlightenment dream if arts and sciences harmoniously progressing              
              as a joint guide to the perfection of humanity.  Professor                     
              Joravsky, in his analysis of major writers and scientists in                   
              France and Russia from the 1860s to the early 20th century is                  
              attempting to explain the emergent rift between literary and                   
              scientific culture.  He is using a comparative approach in order               
              to bring out the interaction between ideas and social context.                 
              He is illuminating the role of political ideologies by examining               
              the transformation of positivism from a visionary ideology to a                
              limited philosophy of science.  He is paying special attention,                
              in this regard, to the problem that the literary imagination                   
              presents to those of positivist inclination.  Prior to beginning               
              this grant, the Professor Joravsky has devoted his attention to                
              the French side of the comparison.  During the course of this                  
              grant, he is concentrating on the Russian side and is carrying                 
              the comparative study to the mid-20th century.
