Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program                 
              will help the Department of Chemistry at the University of                     
              Kansas acquire a Fourier-transform Raman system (FTR).  The FTR                
              will be used in research projects aimed at 1) steady-state and                 
              time-resolved studies of the mechanism of energy conversion in                 
              the photoactive proteins rhodopsin, bacteriohodopsin, and                      
              photosynthetic reaction centers; 2) investigations of structure                
              and the mechanism of oxygen binding in synthetic oxygen-binding                
              compounds; and 3) characterization of electrode processes and                  
              electron transfer in flavoenyzmes and cytochrome c3.                           
                                                                                             
              Raman Spectroscopy is concerned with vibrational and rotational                
              transitions in molecules.  The information obtained sometimes                  
              complements that obtained from an infrared study and provides                  
              valuable structural information.  Fourier-transform Raman                      
              spectroscopy with near-infrared excitation provides a powerful                 
              solution to problems of high background fluorescene or sample                  
              photodegradation or photolability and enhanced signal-to-noise                 
              quality.  Raman spectroscopy is an invaluable tool in studies                  
              of condensed-phase chemical and biomolecular systems.
