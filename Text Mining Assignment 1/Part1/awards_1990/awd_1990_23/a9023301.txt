Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Solar energy can be suited to tasks such as producing pure metals              
              from their ores by using concentrated sunlight to heat reactants               
              to high enough temperatures to initiate reactions.  The PI plans               
              to investigate the use of solar energy as process heat to produce              
              zinc and carbon monoxide from zinc oxide using titanium trioxide.              
                                                                                             
              A two step high temperature process is planned: reduction of zinc              
              oxide (ZnO) with titanium sesquioxide (Ti2O3) to produce zinc and              
              titanium dioxide (TiO2) followed by reduction of TiO2 back to Ti2O3            
              by reaction with carbon.  He plans to determine the overall                    
              reaction rate for the conversion of zinc oxide to metallic zinc                
              using an electric furnace as the reactor.  For the cases where                 
              zinc evolves in the gas phase, the reactants experience a weight               
              loss which will be followed with a microbalance and recorded with              
              a data acquisition system.  This data will be used to establish                
              the rate.  When zinc forms as a liquid, the products will be                   
              quenched after specified run times.  A plot of zinc yield versus               
              time will be used to determine the rate.***
