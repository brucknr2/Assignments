Abstract    :
              Among the most impressive strides in astrophysics over the last                
              decade has been in the area of the physics of compact stars.  Part             
              of the reason for these advances has been the less visible but                 
              equally important progress made in the theory of their internal                
              structure.  In the past several years the Principal Investigator               
              (PI) has been at the forefront of the application of solid-state               
              theoretical physics to the construction of models of white dwarfs              
              and neutron stars.  This one-year award will provide support for               
              a student, Mr. Gordon Brown, to continue his Ph.D. dissertation on             
              two related topics: disk oscillations of low-mass X-ray binaries               
              and nonradial pulsations of magnetized neutron stars.  The first               
              of these is currently a keen subject of X-ray observational                    
              research.  The second is a new class of pulsation modes endemic                
              only to magnetic neutron stars ("pulsars").
