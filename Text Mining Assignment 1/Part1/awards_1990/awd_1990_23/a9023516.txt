Abstract    :
              Professor Harold L. Friedman is supported by a grant from the                  
              Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to perform                     
              theoretical studies in the area of statistical mechanics of                    
              ionic solutions.  This research is of primary importance in                    
              furthering our understanding of the nature of chemical                         
              equilibrium and chemical reactions in solution.                                
                                                                                             
              Professor Friedman will employ a mixture of analytical                         
              statistical mechanical theory and computer simulation to relate                
              measurable properties of solutions to a molecular picture of                   
              the underlying structure and dynamics.  The measurable                         
              properties of primary importance are the electrical                            
              conductivity, concentration dependent equilibria and reaction                  
              rates, especially for charge transfer reactions.  New probes                   
              range from neutron diffraction, which is uniquely powerful for                 
              establishing the molecular structure of solutions, to                          
              spectroscopic methods that have, with the advent of ultra-short                
              pulses for both generating and probing fast molecular                          
              responses, become enormously powerful.
