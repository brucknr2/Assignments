Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Dr. Adams will use the laboratory technique of flowing afterglow               
              to create electron-ion plasmas of those ions which take part in the            
              synthesis of interstellar molecules.  Plasmas of sufficient density            
              can be created to ensure that these ions rapidly recombine by                  
              dissociative electron-ion recombination before they can undergo                
              further ion-neutral reactions.  The rate coefficients for the                  
              recombinations will be determined using a Langmuir probe for cases             
              where the data are not available in the literature.  The neutral               
              products will be identified and their contribution to the product              
              distribution will be determined using the spectroscopic techniques             
              of laser induced fluorescence, resonance enhanced multi-photon                 
              ionization, vacuum ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy, and                    
              emission spectroscopy.                                                         
                                                                                             
              The data that Dr. Adams will obtain are critical for establishing              
              the ion-chemical routes for molecular synthesis in interstellar gas            
              clouds.  With these data, the available theoretical models for                 
              molecular synthesis can be used with confidence, an essential                  
              requirement if the astronomical observations of molecular emissions            
              and absorptions are to be used to deduce many of the fundamental               
              properties of the molecular clouds.  The rate data are also                    
              necessary for determining the viability of the current theories of             
              the recombination process.
