Abstract    :
              The present research program involves modelling and testing of                 
              cellular solids and the design of sandwich panels.  This research              
              plans to achieve two goals: to broaden research interests by                   
              studying interpenetrating composites, a new class of materials                 
              related to cellular solids; and, to apply the understanding of                 
              cellular solids to natural materials, in particular, to cancellous             
              bone.  The study will begin by characterizing the various cellular             
              structures of cancellous bone and suggesting appropriate models for            
              each.  The modelling will first focus on the uniaxial behavior;                
              if successful it will be applied to multiaxial failure criteria and            
              fatigue, both areas of interest to the orthopaedic community.  The             
              models will be compared with data from mechanical tests done in the            
              lab and with data available in the literature.
