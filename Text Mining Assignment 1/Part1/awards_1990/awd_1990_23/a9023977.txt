Abstract    :
              This project addresses a key problem which currently limits the                
              success of machine vision in new applications: design of                       
              algorithms.  Methods are explored to partially automate the                    
              design of vision algorithms for recognizing and localizing                     
              industrial parts and other man-made objects.  The project                      
              suggests a unified methodology for partially automating the                    
              generation of vision algorithms using methodologies of search,                 
              reasoning under uncertainty, perspective geometry analysis, and                
              especially mathematic morphology.  The work also addresses the                 
              important software-related issue of testing and evaluation of                  
              vision algorithms.  The results should find use in industrial,                 
              military, and space applications.
