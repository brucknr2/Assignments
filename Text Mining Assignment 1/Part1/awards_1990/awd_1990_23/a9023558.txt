Abstract    :
                   The PI will address the following research during FAW tenure:             
              reconstruction of the paleoclimate of the Pangaean supercontinent              
              and documentation of events and patterns of Pangaean monsoonal                 
              system.                                                                        
                   A detailed climatic interpretation of North Polar vegetational            
              and thermal change and its relation to lower northern latitudes and            
              southern high latitude vegetation.  This work will help interpret              
              paleoclimate from preangiosperm vegetational physiognomy and                   
              understand the history of latitudinal climate asymmetry.                       
                   A literature depended reclassification of petroleum source                
              rocks for ancient and modern organic - rich sedimentary systems.
