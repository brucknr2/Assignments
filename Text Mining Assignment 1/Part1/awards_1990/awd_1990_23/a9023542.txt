Abstract    :
              This research is on models and tools for the design of board-level             
              digital systems.  Research includes:  (1) Developing a formal                  
              specification language for board-level systems based on well                   
              defined building blocks, where some of the building blocks are very            
              complex, such as microprocessors.  In building the language, only              
              a few critical component types, including programmable parts, are              
              being represented rather than representing all possible parts.  (2)            
              Finding simplified models for the board specification and                      
              verification processes.  The use of hierarchy in the verification              
              process is being explored through specifying the actual behavior               
              of an implementation as well as the desired behavior of the system.            
              Algorithms for timing relationships are being examined also.  (3)              
              Algorithms for layout problems, particularly hierarchal compaction             
              of circuit layouts and the interaction of placement and detailed               
              routing, are being investigated.                                               
                                                                                             
              This grant is made under the Faculty Awards for Women Scientists               
              and Engineers Program.
