Abstract    :
              The goal of this research is to design and develop new techniques              
              of signal analysis and morphological analysis applied to                       
              intracardiac leads.  Over the past two years, six new                          
              computationally efficient detection schemes have been designed in              
              the laboratory and feasibility has been established by preliminary             
              studies in short passages.  Further work is necessary to test the              
              robustness of the detection schemes in the presence of normal                  
              (physiologic) acceleration of heart rate.  In addition,                        
              morphological operators (a non-linear method of analysis of                    
              waveforms) will be applied to address the problem of subtle                    
              waveform changes caused by the introduction or removal of                      
              pharmaceutic agents.  Another new approach, time-frequency                     
              analysis, will also be examined to assess its performance versus               
              standard time-domain methods.  In all cases, the goal is to                    
              increase specificity of detection without loss of sensitivity.
