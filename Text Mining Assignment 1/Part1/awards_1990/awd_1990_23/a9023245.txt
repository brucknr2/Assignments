Abstract    :
              This award supports Dr. J. Bruce Overmier of the University                    
              of Minnesota for a long term visit to work with Drs. Robert                    
              Murison and Holger Ursin of the Institute of Physiological                     
              Psychology of the University of Bergen, Norway.  These                         
              individuals share an interest in the effects of stress on                      
              the behavioral, physiological and immunological functioning                    
              of an animal.  Dr. Overmier's primary area of research has                     
              been in behavioral experimental psychology and defensive                       
              conditioning, while Dr. Murison's has been in physiological                    
              psychology and Dr. Ursin's in medicine and stress.  The                        
              research they propose to carry out collaboratively requires                    
              that each become familiar with the other's areas and that                      
              they adopt an integrative approach to the psychobiology of                     
              stress.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              It has been well demonstrated that stress has a wide variety                   
              of effects upon the funcioning of an animal.  In addition,                     
              exposure to a prior stressor can have either an ameliorative                   
              or a sensitizing influence upon the response to a second                       
              stressor.  It is important to determine the explicit conditions                
              under which such prior exposures have these two different                      
              influences and whether these conditions are the same or                        
              different for the behavioral, physiological, and immunological                 
              systems.  These three lines of research are pursued in this                    
              collaboration.
