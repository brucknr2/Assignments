Abstract    :
              The Synthetic Organic Program will support the research of Dr.                 
              Ei-ichi Negishi of the Department of Chemistry at Purdue                       
              University. Dr. Negishi will continue his innovative studies on                
              organometallic carbon-carbon bond forming reactions catalyzed                  
              or promoted by transition metal complexes, especially ones                     
              involving zirconium and hafnium. This study includes discovery                 
              and development of synthetically attractive new organometallic                 
              reactions and exploration of the scope and mechanism of funda-                 
              mental organometallic reaction patterns.                                       
                                                                                             
              Dr. Negishi will focus his research in four areas: (1)                         
              catalytic reactions of organozirconium and organohafnium                       
              compounds, (2) diastereoselective and enantioselective                         
              reactions of organozirconium and organohafnium compounds, (3)                  
              further exploration of the chemistry of zirconicene and                        
              hafnicene derivatives, and (4) stuctural and mechanistic                       
              studies of organozirconium and organohafnium compounds. In                     
              these studies Dr. Negishi will also systematically investigate                 
              the scope of migratory insertion reactions with emphasis on                    
              those involving d-block transition metals.
