Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project continues a longitudinal study of 9000 men and                    
              women, first interviewed as high school seniors in 1957.  Subse-               
              quent interviews in 1958, 1964, and 1975 have tracked family for-              
              mation, entry and progression in the labor force, and orientation              
              to work and career.  This survey, with respondents now in their                
              50s, permits study of aging phenomena, retirements, grandchil-                 
              dren, health, death of family members, wealth transfer, and                    
              stability or breakup of marriages.  In addition, 7500 siblings of              
              the respondents will be interviewed, providing information on the              
              social context of ambition and other factors in respondents'                   
              lives.  The main goals of this project are (1) to identify and                 
              measure characteristics of people, firms, and job type that                    
              influence chances of employment; (2) to develop and extend mea-                
              surement methods and models of achievement and earnings; (3) to                
              elaborate the effects of sibling influences on achievement,                    
              social participation, well-being, health, success in child rear-               
              ing, providing for retirement, and patterns of health and mor-                 
              tality; (4) to measure social and economic exchange relations                  
              with parents, children, grandchildren, and siblings to assess                  
              consequences of those relationships for well being. Results will               
              improve sociological theories of stratification and mobility,                  
              aging, and family processes, as well as having implications for                
              policies affecting the aging nature of the U.S. population.
