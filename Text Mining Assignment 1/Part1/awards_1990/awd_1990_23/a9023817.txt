Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              With a Faculty Award for Women Scientists and Engineers from the               
              National Science Foundation, Dr. Caryl Rusbult will continue her               
              research into social exchange processes.  She is exploring the                 
              processes by which individuals maintain stable ongoing                         
              relationships.  This research is conducted not only in the                     
              interpersonal relationships area but also in organizational                    
              behavior.  Her studies emphasize the functional value of                       
              adaptations to patterns of interpendence.  This work involves                  
              studies of commitment, responses to dissatisfaction, accomodation              
              processes, and organizational behavior. The research on                        
              commitment will include the study of commitment in abusive                     
              relationships.  In studying responses to dissatisfaction, she                  
              will try to identify features of a relationship and of                         
              individuals that promote different responses.  Studies in                      
              organizational behavior will consider policies that encourage                  
              commitment to the organization.                                                
                                                                                             
              This work has important implications for organizational                        
              maintainance and decay, divorce, interpersonal conflict, neglect,              
              social reconciliation, and group productivity.
