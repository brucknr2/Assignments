Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is to organize and develop the                                    
              4th US/Japan Workshop in Earthquake Disaster                                   
              Prevention of Lifeline Systems.                                                
                                                                                             
              The workshop will provide an opportunity for                                   
              researchers, designers, and construction                                       
              specialists to exchange discussions and ideas                                  
              on the current state-of-the-art in seismic                                     
              risk assessment and design for lifelines.  In                                  
              addition it will determine future directions                                   
              to be pursued to improve current methods, and                                  
              establish what mutual programs between the                                     
              U.S. and Japan can be initiated so that the                                    
              most effective use of available information                                    
              is maximized.  The workshop will be conducted                                  
              in Los Angeles, in late summer of 1991.                                        
                                                                                             
              This workshop will be of great benefit for                                     
              the program development of the Earthquake                                      
              Hazards Mitigation Program as it will                                          
              identify future research needs in lifeline                                     
              systems research.  As an international                                         
              activity between the United States and Japan,                                  
              it will be of mutual benefit to both                                           
              countries in the development of lifeline                                       
              system earthquake -resistant design.
