Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The purpose of this research is to develop compounds as tools to               
              study opioid receptors.  These receptors are proteins which are                
              responsible for both the beneficial and the undisirable effects                
              of narcotic analgesics such as morphine.  However, not all opioid              
              receptors are identical and this has complicated the study of                  
              this receptor group.  Since the demonstration of these multiple                
              opioid receptors about fifteen years ago, numerous compounds have              
              been prepared in attempts to differentiate the receptor types.                 
              To further complicate the issue, endogenous morphine-like                      
              substances have been isolated from animals.  These compounds,                  
              opioid peptides, are fragments of other proteins and appear to be              
              involved in a number of physiological functions including pain                 
              sensation.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              This research involves the preparation of derivatives of one of                
              the opioid peptides, dynorphin.  This opioid interacts with                    
              kappa-opioid receptors which are distinct from morphine                        
              receptors.  The study of kappa opioid receptors may lead to the                
              development of better nonaddictive analgesics.  The opioids are                
              synthesized containing 'affinity labels' which cause the                       
              synthetic opioid to permanently bind to the receptor.  In this                 
              way, any neuroscientists or pharmacologist may use these new                   
              peptides to differentiate between the various types of opioid                  
              receptors.
