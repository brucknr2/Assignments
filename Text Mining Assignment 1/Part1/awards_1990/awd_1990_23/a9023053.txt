Abstract    :
              This study uses the theory of information transmission over                    
              communication channels to explain how supply and demand                        
              information is communicated to the public by market prices.  The               
              stock market is chosen as a specific example.  Rising and falling              
              stock prices should signal fundamental changes in the value of                 
              the underlying stocks.  Excess stock price volatility occurs when              
              stock prices change but the fundamental stock values do not.  The              
              theory of information transmission is used to show that such                   
              false price signals can be detected and thereby discounted by                  
              market traders.  Successful detection leads to a more efficient                
              market and increased social welfare by making the allocation of                
              national resources more efficient.  The theoretical market model               
              proposed is validated using New York Stock Exchange stock price                
              and volume data covering the historically most volatile period of              
              this exchange.  The study is important in understanding the                    
              general nature of information transmission and content.  In that               
              regard, this study explores the fundamental characteristics of                 
              information by using an engineering communications theory to                   
              analyze information flows in economic markets.
