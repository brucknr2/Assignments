Abstract    :
              The main objectives of the project are to undertake additional                 
              extensions and refinements of the semi-nonparametric (SNP) approach            
              to modeling multiple time series. The SNP approach is based on a               
              Hermite series expansion of the conditional density of a strictly              
              stationary multivariate process. The leading term is either a                  
              linear vector autoregressive model or an autoregressive conditional            
              heteroskedastic model, with the choice depending upon the                      
              application. Higher order terms accommodate deviations from the                
              leading term, including, for example, non-normalities or                       
              nonlinearities.                                                                
                                                                                             
              The work is in two parts: a methodological section and an empirical            
              section. The methodological work entails developing new ways to use            
              the SNP approach for nonparametric structural estimation and to                
              ascertain the dynamics embodied in an SNP estimate of the                      
              conditional density. The empirical work involves applications of               
              SNP methods to issues in asset pricing and financial volatility.               
              The main research tools for the empirical work are nonlinear                   
              maximum likelihood estimation and Monte Carlo simulation.                      
                                                                                             
              The work will have an impact in several areas: documenting                     
              interesting regularities in financial time series data, forecasting            
              turning points in economic data, and allowing estimation of what               
              would previously be considered intractable models. Dissemination               
              of the computer code developed by the project will be an important             
              addition to the econometrics infrastructure.
