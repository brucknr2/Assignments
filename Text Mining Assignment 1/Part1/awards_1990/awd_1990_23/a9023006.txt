Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Aquaculture production of penaeid shrimp larvae is                        
              constrained by costly and unreliable supplies of live food,                    
              especially Artemia nauplii.  Despite Japanese and European                     
              commercialization of high quality larval feeds, a complete                     
              replacement for Artemia has not yet emerged.  Larval shrimp                    
              production continues to be an industry bottleneck.  This                       
              research is to formulate and test a complex microencapsulated                  
              feed consisting of <10 um, lipid- walled microcapsules and high                
              quality micronutrients stabilized within 45 to 500 um microgel                 
              particles.  Lipid-walled microcapsules will be produced by a                   
              modified double-emulsion process, and they will contain water-                 
              soluble micronutrients in the payload (core material).                         
              Microgel particles will be formed by ionic gelation and they                   
              will consist of a protein-enriched hydrocolloid matrix. Unlike                 
              permeable crosslinked protein microcapsules, these complex                     
              microcapsules will be vitamin-impermeable and maintain nutrient                
              balance.  In-vitro vitamin-leaching rates will be correlated                   
              with growth and survival of penaeid shrimp larvae to evaluate                  
              R&D feasibility.  Commercialization potential will be evident                  
              from the in-vitro analytic values and whole-animal responses to                
              test feeds.
