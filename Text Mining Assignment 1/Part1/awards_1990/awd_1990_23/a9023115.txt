Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Scientists at the California Institute of Technology are carrying              
              out a new Palomar Observatory Sky Survey known as POSS II.  Private            
              grants helped fund an upgrading of the telescope and laboratory                
              facilities and materials for the survey.  National Science                     
              Foundation (NSF) funds support a photographic scientist who                    
              oversees the quality control necessary to produce a collection of              
              high quality photographic plates.                                              
                                                                                             
              The first Palomar Observatory Sky Survey, produced in the period               
              1952-1957, is an extremely important reference source for all of               
              astronomy.  However, since the sky is constantly changing through              
              long term spectral and intensity changes, proper motions of                    
              celestial objects, and relatively short term explosive events, as              
              well as through improved instrumentation and photographic                      
              techniques, a repeat of the 30 year old atlas is of great                      
              importance.
