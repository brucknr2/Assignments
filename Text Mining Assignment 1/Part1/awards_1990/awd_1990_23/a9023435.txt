Abstract    :
              This project will study the process of turnover in the small                   
              business sector. The work departs from previous research  in that              
              rather than treating the business firm alone as the unit of                    
              analysis, the business firm and the owner are considered together.             
              Thinking this way leads to a consideration of another aspect of                
              firm turnover which has received little attention in the literature            
              on small businesses, namely, the movement of businesses across                 
              owners.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              The project will employ a new data set collected by the Census                 
              Bureau called the Characteristics of Business Owners Survey. The               
              first part of the project will be an unstructured approach to                  
              uncover the basic patterns in the data with respect to business                
              turnover. The second part is to develop a theory which successfully            
              organizes the data in the sense of being capable of matching the               
              most significant patterns. The model to be developed will combine              
              two search processes. The first is the search for good matches                 
              between businesses and business owners. The second is the search               
              for businesses of high "general" quality.                                      
                                                                                             
              The small business sector represents a nonnegligible portion of all            
              economic activity in the United States. Census figures show that               
              23 percent of all employment in 1982 was accounted for by firms                
              with 19 or fewer employees. Understanding the characteristics of               
              these businesses is important for estimating the impact of                     
              government policies, especially the treatment of capital gains and             
              other tax policy issues.
