Abstract    :
              This project describes the synthesis of novel organic materials                
              that will serve as precursors for the preparation of organic                   
              superconductors.  The synthesis of the organic compounds, the                  
              preparation of the organic conductors by electrocrystallization,               
              and the structural characterization of these novel conducting                  
              materials will be carried out at Indiana University.  Transport                
              measurements, Meisner effect determinations, and more demanding                
              structural studies such as neutron diffraction will be done at                 
              Argonne National Laboratories, and a collaboration on quantum                  
              chemistry/physics and band calculations will be done jointly with              
              North Carolina State University.
