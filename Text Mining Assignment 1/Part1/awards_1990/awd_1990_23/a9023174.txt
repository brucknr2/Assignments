Abstract    :
                     This project concerns the application of the Utah  Retrieval System
              Architecture to very large databases of  full-text documents.  This effort
              involves the development  of a mediumscale (4 to 10 GBytes) parallel backend
              search  server using augmented RISC processors as the searching  engines.  Data
              is being gathered and analyzed to determine  if the existence of a high-speed
              search server changes the  complexity and arrival rate of queries by real users
              (law  students).  In addition, a suitable partitioning of  functionality such
              that remote users can be supported by  such a searching engine over
              medium-speed networks (such as  ISDN) is being studied.  The researchers are
              also examining  how the system can be reconfigured to deal with disk and 
              searcher failures.
