Abstract    :
                   During the past decade, a host of new techniques and methods              
              have been developed to answer a variety of module-theoretic                    
              questions.  Such methods include homological, categorical, finite              
              dimensional, set-theoretic, integral representation, and geometric             
              techniques.  The power of these tools has not yet been fully                   
              realized, due partly to the diversity of topics encompassed by the             
              phrase "module theory", and partly to the lack of a forum in which             
              the pioneers of these techniques can explain the power of their                
              methods to others.                                                             
                   This grant will partially support a conference on Methods in              
              Module Theory to be held at the University of Colorado at Colorado             
              Springs, May 29 - June 1, 1991, which will provide the necessary               
              forum.  The cross-fertilization philosophy of the conference,                  
              together with the expository nature of the principal lectures,                 
              makes this conference an appropriate setting for graduate students             
              and recent Ph.D.s, as well as the more experienced researchers.
