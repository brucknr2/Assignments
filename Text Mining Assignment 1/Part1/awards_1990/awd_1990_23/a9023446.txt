Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              With a Faculty Award for Women Scientists and Engineers from the               
              National Science Foundation, Dr. Mary Kennedy will continue her                
              long-term study on elucidating the molecular structure of                      
              synaptic modification during learning and memory.  Presently, Dr.              
              Kennedy is studying the biochemical mechanisms that underlie                   
              synaptic plasticity, the basis for information storage in the                  
              brain.  Dr. Kennedy's laboratory was the first to identify and                 
              purify type II CAM kinase, a brain calcium dependent protein                   
              enzyme.  This enzyme is a specialized product of nerve cells in                
              the forebrain that plays a role in the initiation of long-term                 
              potentiation, an important form of synaptic regulation that                    
              underlies the early stages of memory formation.  The major goals               
              of this research will be to identify functionally important                    
              synaptic proteins in CNS nerve cells that are regulated by CAM                 
              kinase, and to develop novel quantitative methods to measure the               
              time course and cellular location of regulatory phosphorylation                
              events in nerve cells.
