Abstract    :
              Specific technical objectives of this research are to:                          
                                                                                            
              o Evaluate the current understanding of material                               
                properties (primarily for silicon, bulk and thin                             
                films), as a basis for good spring design.  These                            
                properties will not only include the tensile and                             
                shear moduli, but also the yield strength, fracture,                         
                and fatigue properties.                                                      
                                                                                             
              o Determine a set of commonly required spring                                  
                configurations (cantilevers, spirals, bridges, etc).                         
                                                                                             
              o Analyze (utilizing micro-finite element analysis)                            
                spring configurations for their compliance,                                  
                resistance to manufacturing errors and tolerances,                           
                resistance to stress concentrations, fatigue, etc.                           
                                                                                             
              o Analyze spring configurations for their micro-                               
                dynamic responses, resonant frequencies, etc.                                
                                                                                             
              o From the above, extract a set of rules for                                   
                designing standard springs.   The rule-set will                              
                depend upon:  material; stiffness (or natural                                
                frequency) required; space and orientation                                   
                 required; preferred technology, and other aspects.                          
                                                                                             
              o Integrate the rule-set into a computer-aided                                 
                micro-mechanical spring/oscillator design system.
