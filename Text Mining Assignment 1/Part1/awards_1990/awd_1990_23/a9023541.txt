Abstract    :
              This research consists of work on:  (1) Interpenetrating polymer               
              networks-their synthesis, characterization, microstructure,                    
              electrical conductivity of iodine-doped samples and the computer               
              simulation of their formation and properties; (2) Template                     
              effects on copolymerization; (3) The study of polymer dynamical                
              relaxation times by biased sampling Monte Carlo simulations; and               
              (4) The effects of large static or dynamically induced anisotropy              
              on polymer systems.  In each of these topics they will stress the              
              influence of polymer architecture and isomerism (including                     
              topological isomerism).                                                        
                                                                                             
              This research is a combined theoretical and experimental project               
              designed to relate physical properties with the molecular                      
              architecture of polymers.
