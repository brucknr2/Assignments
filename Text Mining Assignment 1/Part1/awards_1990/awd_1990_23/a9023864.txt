Abstract    :
                   This project will investigate stability and equilibria in                 
              plasma with collisions, instabilities and scattering properties of             
              bound states of scalar wave equations, scattering frequencies of               
              time periodic systems, and regularity of linear and nonlinear                  
              dispersive waves.  The fundamental mathematical problems focus on              
              global existence for certain initial value problems.                           
                   These studies in linear and nonlinear waves find applications             
              in fields such as astrophysics and thermonuclear fusion.
