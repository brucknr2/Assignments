Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Using the (VLA) Very Large Array, the astronomers at Northwestern              
              University have obtained radio observations of the galactic center             
              region and prominent galactic HII regions that constitute some of              
              the largest continuum and spectral line data bases in radio                    
              astronomy.  A large amount of optical spectroscopic data has also              
              been acquired in the application of high signal-to-noise techniques            
              for the study of interstellar and Quasi-Stellar Object (QSO)                   
              absorption lines.  The image processing tasks required for the                 
              optimum reduction and analysis of these enormous data sets make the            
              ready availability of substantial computer capabilities essential.             
              This award will provide support for the acquisition of a mini-                 
              supercomputer (IBM RS/6000 powerserver 540) and its peripherals so             
              that mosiac images of some of the most complex regions of the                  
              galaxy can be made and numerous other research projects                        
              currently being carried out by the PIs be facilitated.                         
              Northwestern University has already contributed over $130,000 in               
              purchasing computer equipment for the PIs and will contribute                  
              another $47,000 to this facility.
