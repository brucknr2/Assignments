Abstract    :
              The Principal Investigator is developing a research                            
              program in a novel concept of high-density, high-                              
              speed optical memory and optical computing based                               
              on photon echoes, that has inherent potential for                              
              massively parallel real-time processing of temporally                          
              as well as spatially encoded data.  Photon time-                               
              delayed laser pulses pass through a resonant atomic                            
              system.  The system responds by emitting, after a                              
              certain delay time, a burst of laser-like light.  This                         
              is the echo.  By studying the relaxation, modulation,                          
              polarization, etc., of the photon echo signal, much                            
              detailed information about the dynamic interactions                            
              within the atomic system can be obtained.  On the                              
              other hand, the fact that the atomic system emits a                            
              light pulse of some time after the passage of laser                            
              pulses, implies that the system somehow                                        
              remembers.  This is the basic optical memory                                   
              concept of photon echoes.
