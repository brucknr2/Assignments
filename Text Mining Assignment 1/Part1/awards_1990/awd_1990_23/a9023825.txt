Abstract    :
              This action continues the Interagency Agreement between the                    
              National Science Foundation and the Arctic Research Commission and             
              provides for its continuing operations.  The Arctic Research                   
              Commission was established under the Arctic Research Policy Act of             
              1984 (Public Law 98-373) and Executive Order 12501.  The General               
              Services Administration will provide administrative services to the            
              Commission as specified in Public Law 98-373 (Section 106(4)).                 
                                                                                             
              This action fulfills the intent of Congress to provide FY 1991                 
              funding for the Commission through the NSF.
