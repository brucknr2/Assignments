Abstract    :
              This proposal will extend on-going experimental work on                        
              the degradation of p-nitrophenolic wastes by an enriched                       
              Pseudomonas strain.  A unique membrane reactor is to be                        
              developed that immobilizes the cells and provides for                          
              multi-phase processing.  Such a reactor can isolate the                        
              active biomass from a waste stream while permitting                            
              transport of the toxicant to the biomass, and allows the                       
              maintenance of optimal culture conditions for maximum                          
              degradative activity.  The effects of immobilization on                        
              cell physiology and gene expression will be addressed as a                     
              function of system operating conditions.
