Abstract    :
              Drs. John B. Hopkins and Carl F. Knopf are supported by a grant                
              from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to                    
              perform ultrafast transient Raman spectroscopic investigations                 
              of reactions occuring in supercritical fluids.  The goal of                    
              this research is to understand the role which solvent plays in                 
              condensed phase chemical reactions.                                            
                                                                                             
              The main thrust of the research is to investigate solvent                      
              effects on chemical dynamics near the critical point of atomic                 
              and small polyatomic solvents.  Drs. Hopkins and Knopf will                    
              attempt to characterize the local solvent density in clusters                  
              surrounding infinitely dilute solute molecules near the                        
              critical point by directly measuring the density dependence of                 
              vibrational energy relaxation in diatomic solute molecules.                    
              They will also investigate the effect of local solvent density                 
              on chemical dynamics using ultrafast laser studies of                          
              photodissociation and geminate recombination reactions.  Direct                
              real time investigations will focus on understanding the role                  
              of 1) solvent clusters and dynamic density fluctuations, 2) van                
              der Waals complexes, and 3) energy transfer in determining                     
              reactivity at different fluid densities.
