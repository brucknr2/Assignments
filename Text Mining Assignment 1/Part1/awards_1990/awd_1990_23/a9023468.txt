Abstract    :
              The proposed research will lead to                                             
              the development of a new class of                                              
              superconducting magnetic senors,                                               
              utilizing the newly discovered high                                            
              Tc cooper oxide superconductors.                                               
              High Tc instruments are expected to                                            
              offer better performance than non                                              
              superconducting counterparts,                                                  
              together with lower operating cost                                             
              than low Tc superconducting                                                    
              instruments.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              The proposed work focuses upon the                                             
              coupling of high Tc superconducting

              flux transformer technology can also                                           
              be applied to couple to a high Tc

              to use the superconducting loop, or                                            
              "antenna", to couple external fields                                           
              into the fluxgate, and we were able                                            
              to use the fluxgate to demonstrate                                             
              the ability of the superconducting                                             
              loop, to carry a persistent current.
