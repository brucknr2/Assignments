Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Description:  Under this project a team headed by Dr. R.                       
              Raja of Fermi Laboratory and Dr. J. M. Kohli of Panjab                         
              University in Chandigarh, India will participate in the D0                     
              Experiment.  That experiment is the second all purpose                         
              colliding beams detector at the Fermilab Tevatron.  Using                      
              high resolution uranium argon calorimetry, they hope to                        
              look for effects beyond the standard model of                                  
              interactions.  Supersymmetry technicolor and other such                        
              predicted but as yet unobserved effects will be searched                       
              for.  Within the standard model, it is hoped to find                           
              evidence for the hitherto unconfirmed top quark as well as                     
              measure the mass difference between the W and Z particles                      
              to a precision that makes possible the study of the                            
              radiative effects within the standard model.                                   
                                                                                             
              Scope:  The Indian physicists will contribute by                               
              fabricating hardware and electronic components in India to                     
              be used as components in the D0 detector in the experiment                     
              at Fermilab.  They will also participate in the development                    
              of data acquisition software and data analysis.  The                           
              collaboration is beneficial to the U.S. and Indian                             
              scientists and fully meets the objectives of the U.S.-India                    
              Program.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              This project is funded under two grants:                                       
              INT 9023183 to Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory                           
              INT 9100700 to Panjab University, Chandigarh, India
