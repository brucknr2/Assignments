Abstract    :
              Networks of computers have become very common, so it is very important         
              to develop methods for reliable and efficient communication between            
              computers.  One low cost scheme is to have a single shared                     
              communication medium, called a multiple access channel, such that              
              every computer can receive all messages sent over the channel.  This           
              scheme is currently used by the Ethernet and other networks.                   
              If two or more computers send messages simultaneously, they will               
              interfere with each other, and no useful information will be                   
              transmitted.  The main goal of this research project is to develop             
              improved probabilistic and deterministic algorithms which coordinate           
              the computers' access to the channel so that the percentage of time in         
              which useful information is transmitted is maximized.  Also, the               
              maximum possible percentage of useful time on multiple access channels         
              will be determined.  The algorithms for multiple access channels will          
              be used to develop efficient algorithms for parallel computers.  A             
              second focus is to develop fast algorithms which design minimum cost           
              network topologies that are resistant to failures.
