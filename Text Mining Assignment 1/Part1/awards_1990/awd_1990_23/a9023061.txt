Abstract    :
                   Meetings of the International Cartographic Association are held           
              every two years.  More than 500 cartographers and scientists and               
              practitioners from related disciplines convene at these meetings to            
              learn the latest research results, to plan future collaborative                
              research activities, to examine the latest equipment and techniques,           
              and to meet other professionals who share their interests.  This award         
              provides $15,000 to enable between 15 and 20 American cartographers to         
              attend and participate in the next ICA meeting, which will be held in          
              Bournemouth, England, in September 1991.  Distribution of group-travel         
              funds will be made by a subcommittee of the U.S. National Committee of         
              the ICA; it will use an evaluation system that gives preference to             
              young scholars, women, and members of underrepresented minority groups.        
                   Group-travel support through this award will enable more Americans        
              to attend and participate in the 1991 ICA meeting.  Their participation        
              at this meeting will enable them to stay informed on new research              
              results and to plan future activities.  Because special emphasis is            
              being given to the support of members of groups that have been                 
              underrepresented in past ICA activities, the quality and range of              
              scientific activities facilitated by this meeting will be even greater.
