Abstract    :
              With this grant in the Theoretical and Computational Program of                
              the Chemistry Division, professor Hase will use computer                       
              simulation to study chemical dynamics at a microscopic level.                  
              The results of  these simulations will help experimentalists                   
              estimate the rates of important chemical reactions.                            
                                                                                             
              Different methods will be tested for treating zero point energy                
              in classical trajectory simulations of polyatomic molecules.                   
              This will involve, in part, comparisons with quantum dynamical                 
              calculations. The theory of unimolecular reaction dynamics will                
              be enhanced by investigating (1) the properties of wave                        
              functions and rate constants associated with mode specific                     
              decomposition; (2) energy partioning in dissociation products;                 
              and (3) the treatment of anharmonicity and                                     
              vibrational/rotational coupling for microcanonically excited                   
              molecules. Microscopic properties of association reactions such                
              as energy transfer pathways and the role of angular momentum                   
              will be studied, and an accurate model will be developed for                   
              the association rate constant. To bridge the gap between                       
              solution and gas-phase chemical kinetics, the association of                   
              solvated reactants will be studied. A study of phase space                     
              bottlenecks and central barrier recrossing will be performed                   
              for SN2 nucleophilic substitution reactions.
