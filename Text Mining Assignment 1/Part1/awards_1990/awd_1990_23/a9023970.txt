Abstract    :
                   This project will advance three-dimensional X-ray image                   
              reconstruction by developing cone-beam reconstruction algorithms               
              via Fourier techniques that are more efficient and accurate than               
              existing methods.  Such algorithms are crucial in Computed                     
              Tomography, a method applied in particular to nondestructive                   
              evaluation of industrial objects.  Computed Tomography provides                
              views of the interior of objects by integrating data acquired by               
              area detectors.  The integration of such data is a complex                     
              mathematical problem which this project will advance.  A                       
              successful high speed, high quality, and low cost reconstructor                
              is expected out of this project.
