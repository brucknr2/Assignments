Abstract    :
                   This award provides support for Dr. Donna Peuquet through the             
              National Science Foundation's Faculty Awards for Women Scientists and          
              Engineers Program.  The objectives of this program are to recognize            
              some of the nation's most outstanding and promising women scientists           
              and engineers holding academic positions combining research and                
              teaching, to retain them in academia, and to facilitate the further            
              development of their careers.                                                  
                   This award will allow Dr. Peuquet to continue her research on the         
              ways that geographic information is represented, both conceptually and         
              physically, as computer-based data observations.  This research will           
              build on research already conducted by the investigator that                   
              establishes a conceptual framework for the representation of physical          
              space in geographic information systems (GISs).  Software also has been        
              developed to permit synthesis of location-based and object-based               
              representations of data in GISs.  The investigator's next lines of             
              inquiry will include expansion of the representational framework to            
              include a temporal dimension, thereby enhancing the capabilities of            
              GISs to assist in analysis of the spatial-temporal dimensions of               
              geographic processes.  The investigator also will begin to define a            
              formal spatial language that describes spatial-temporal processes while        
              still incorporating the context dependencies and inexact properties            
              that often are characteristic of these processes.  Such a formal               
              language should provide a more robust and flexible spatial database            
              query language than is available using standard query language-based           
              approaches.
