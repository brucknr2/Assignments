Abstract    :
              Cyanobacteria are prokaryotic organisms that carry out green plant             
              photosynthesis, evolving oxygen in the light.  For some strains,               
              there exists a convenient system of genetic analysis based on DNA-             
              mediated transformation.  In addition, cyanobacteria control the               
              expression of some genes in response to changes in the quantity or             
              quality of light.  We will exploit a gene encyclopedia (an ordered             
              set of cosmid clones covering the entire chromosome) of                        
              Synechocystis 6803 to locate genes that respond to light changes               
              and then to define, by in vitro and in vitro analyses, both the                
              nucleotide sequences required to regulate those genes (cis-acting              
              elements) and the proteins responsible for their differential                  
              expression (trans-acting elements).  The combined genetic and                  
              biochemical approach should allow us to identify the components of             
              the regulatory cascade that transduces a light signal into a gene              
              expression response.
