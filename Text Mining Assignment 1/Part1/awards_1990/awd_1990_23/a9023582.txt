Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This study involves the translation and analysis of previously                 
              collected data consisting of extensive life-histories of young                 
              adults in rural southern Morocco.  Taking the life-narratives as               
              cultural "texts", and relating this material (from extensive in-               
              depth study of individual life-histories) to more general                      
              material from ethnographic studies, the project will analyze the               
              relation of cultural symbols and the individual's sense of                     
              himself as a person.  The investigator, (a psychologist, who is                
              fluent in the language but does not have the sensitivity of a                  
              native speaker) will work with a native speaker of Moroccan                    
              Arabic to complete the translation and analysis of the life                    
              narrative texts as well as a series of projective tests taken by               
              these respondents.  The funds will support six months of half-                 
              time research by the investigator, who will analyze the cultural               
              components and constitution of self-representation.                            
                                                                                             
              This research is important because the relation between a                      
              person's sense of him- or herself and the cultural environment                 
              that person lives is has been not well understood. The                         
              ethnographic component of the project is also important, as any                
              increased understanding of Arabic personalities will help us                   
              understand how and why people in those cultures behave as they                 
              do.
