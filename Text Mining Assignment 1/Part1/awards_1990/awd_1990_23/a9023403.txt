Abstract    :
                   The main focus of this research will be the numerical                     
              generation of orthogonal polynomials, specifically the                         
              computation of their coefficients.  Two new classes of orthogonal              
              polynomials are to be investigated from this constructive point                
              of view.  One involves a novel weight function that contains the               
              square of an orthogonal polynomial as a factor.  The other                     
              relates to an inner product containing derivatives.  Orthogonal                
              polynomials are a useful tool in applied analysis: they serve as               
              basic elements for approximating functions and they are used to                
              develop quadrature schemes for difficult integrals.  In this                   
              project the principal investigator will study special orthogonal               
              polynomials of interest in quantum chemistry.//
