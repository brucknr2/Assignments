Abstract    :
                   This project supports the research and programmatic activities            
              of the Institute for Mathematics and Its Applications located at               
              the University of Minnesota.  The Institute for Mathematics and Its            
              Applications (IMA) is a unique National Science Foundation                     
              institute addressing a national need.  The IMA is reviving and                 
              strengthening the natural and historic ties between the                        
              mathematical sciences and other sciences and engineering and                   
              between academic scholarship and industrial research.  The IMA                 
              programs identify problems and areas of mathematical sciences                  
              research of concern to other sciences, encourage the development               
              and study of new areas of the mathematical sciences, and stimulate             
              collaboration between mathematical scientists and other scientists.            
              The IMA encourages participation of mathematical sciences in areas             
              of application by: providing an atmosphere conducive to the                    
              solution of major problems in various areas of the mathematical                
              sciences; presenting important scientific and technological                    
              problems that provide real challenges to mathematical scientists;              
              and demonstrating that research in the mathematical sciences has               
              significant impact in science and engineering.                                 
                   Yearly IMA programs are carefully chosen to provide a meeting             
              ground for mathematical scientists with engineers and scientists               
              from academia, industry, and government laboratories.  A year's                
              topic may be in an area of application which requires a number of              
              different mathematical fields, or it may be a broad area of the                
              mathematical sciences known to have applications in a number of                
              scientific disciplines.  A typical yearly program is designed                  
              around a cadre of senior scientists who are in residence for                   
              periods of three to ten months.  These senior scientists provide               
              continuity for the program and scientific guidance for the                     
              postdoctoral members.  The mentoring of postdoctoral fellows is a              
              key component of the IMA programs.  In addition to National Science            
              Foundation support, the IMA is supported by 24 sponsoring                      
              universities and 13 sponsoring corporations.
