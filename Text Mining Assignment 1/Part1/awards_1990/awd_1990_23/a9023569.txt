Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Moss Landing Marine Laboratory of San Jose State University                
              will acquire several items of ocenaographic instrumentation to                 
              placed in a pool of shared use equipment. This equipment is                    
              maintained for use on or in association with the R/V POINT SUR, a              
              research vessel owned by the NSF and operatate by the laboratory.              
              A substantial part of the ship's operating schedule during 1991                
              is in support of NSF.sponsored research projects. The                          
              instrumentation will also increase the capabilities of the ship                
              and of the University to support research and engineering                      
              activities. The instrumentation includes:                                      
                                                                                             
              .A pc computer system for shipboard data management that is                    
              essential for real.time acquisition and display of large data                  
              sets,                                                                          
              .A six.pen color plotter for displaying processed data on board                
              ship,                                                                          
              .A precision temperature and conductivity sensors for improving                
              the capabilities of the CTD system,                                            
              .remote readout of navigational system for main science                        
              laboratory, and                                                                
              .triple point of water cell for use in calibrations and high                   
              precision chemical analyses at sea.                                            
                                                                                             
              The instrumentation described above will increase the capability               
              of the institution to support NSF.sponsored research and                       
              engineering projects.
