Abstract    :
              This Faculty Award for Women Scientists and Engineers is made                  
              to Dr. Jeanne E. Pemberton of the Department of Chemistry at                   
              the University of Arizona.  Pemberton will establish a new                     
              research area using unenhanced Raman scattering to characterize                
              thin surface films of self-assembled molecular structures.  The                
              goal of the project is to construct bilayers which mimic                       
              biological membranes in order to investigate their permeability                
              to ions, water, and various organic molecules.

              The NSF Faculty Award for Women recognizes the high quality of                 
              the awardee's record in teaching and scholarship as well as                    
              potential for continued significant contributions to scientific                
              research, the academic profession, and the education of future                 
              scientists.  Particularly noteworthy achievements are                          
              Pemberton's encouragement of undergraduate research and                        
              research in the area of spectroscopic surface analysis.
