Abstract    :
              This award supports Professor Robert Soare of the University                   
              of Chicago and three other US mathematicians to collaborate on                 
              research in the field of mathematical logic with Professor                     
              Klaus Ambos-Spies of the University of Heidelberg.  Through                    
              reciprocal research visits, they are developing new insights                   
              into recursive function theory, the theory of computation, and                 
              computational complexity.                                                      
                                                                                             
              Research on these topics has recently become very active in the                
              U.S. and abroad.  The increasing relation and application to                   
              theoretical computer science and computational complexity have                 
              made them even more timely.  The U.S. participants in this                     
              collaboration have become some of the U.S. leaders in the field                
              of recursive function theory.  Germany, meanwhile,  has had a                  
              long and distinguished tradition in the field.  Klaus Ambos-                   
              Spies is currently the leading figure in Germany in recursive                  
              function theory.  He has done extensive work in applications of                
              the methods of recursive function theory to computational                      
              complexity.  Further collaboration among these leading                         
              mathematicians in this increasingly important field should                     
              continue to be extremely productive.
