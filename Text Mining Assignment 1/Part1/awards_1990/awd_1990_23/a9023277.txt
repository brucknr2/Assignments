Abstract    :
              Professor Devlin is supported by a grant from the Experimental                 
              Physical Chemistry Program to study icy thin films and                         
              clusters, including crystalline ice, amorphous ice and acid                    
              hydrates using infrared spectroscopy.  The data acquired will                  
              enhance our understanding of natural processes such as                         
              nucleation and growth of icy particles in the atmosphere, the                  
              molecular-level processes at ice surfaces that lead to charge                  
              separation in electrical storms, and proton conductivity across                
              and along biomembrane-water interfaces.                                        
                                                                                             
              The influence of surfaces, interfaces and intense near-infrared                
              radiation on point-defect activities (ionic: hydrogen and                      
              hydroxyl ions, and orientational: L and D) of hydrogen-bonded                  
              solids will be examined in icy thin films and clusters,                        
              including ice I, amorphous ice, acid hydrates and clathrate                    
              hydrates.  Fourier transform infrared and Raman spectroscopies                 
              will be used to monitor isotopic exchange rates for samples                    
              containing nonequilibrium quantitites of protium and deuterium                 
              isotopomers. These experiments will take advantage of a                        
              technique recently developed by Devlin based on observations                   
              that the absorption bands of OH groups that dangle from the                    
              surfaces are distinct from the OH groups which are involved in                 
              hydrogen bonds. These methods will be applied to the evaluation                
              of the hypothesis that phase transitions of icy substances are                 
              critically dependent on the availability of mobile                             
              orientational defects.
