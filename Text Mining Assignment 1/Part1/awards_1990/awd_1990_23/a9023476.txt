Abstract    :
              A prerequisite for the development of contemporary scientific                  
              research was the development of instrumentation for precision                  
              measurement to a degree of accuracy which was thought impossible               
              prior to the 19th century.  In her study, "The Meaning of                      
              Precision,"  Dr. Olesko is examining the objective and subjective              
              significance of precision instruments when they first really began             
              to be systematically developed, i.e. in Prussian science and                   
              scientific culture from the late 1810s to the 1870s.  The 1810's               
              was the time when the method of least squares was first introduced             
              into physical investigations;  the 1860s and 1870s was the time                
              when the consequences of the first state-supported projects                    
              requiring precision instruments (weights and measures,                         
              triangulation, and heating power of fuels) were felt in Prussian               
              society.  Dr. Olesko is examining selected issues concerning                   
              precision measurement in science (chiefly physics, but also                    
              chemistry and to some extent physiology) and in science teaching               
              (chiefly physics).  She is also exploring the utility of exact                 
              experiment and precision measurement for the Prussian state.  In               
              addition, by looking at images, metaphors and rhetoric, she is                 
              including studies of the symbolic and cultural meaning of                      
              precision.  Finally, she is including a comparative component--                
              primarily by examining American notions of precision during this               
              period, but also other comparisons are being considered.  This                 
              study is essential for a proper understanding of the rise of                   
              contemporary science.
