Abstract    :
              This research investigates problems of bioremediation                          
              (trichloroethylene degradation by methane-utilizing bacteria) and              
              trace gas cycling (utilization of the greenhouse gases methane and             
              methyl halides by methylotrophs).  Laboratory experiments to study             
              substrate utilization kinetics and regulation will be coupled with             
              studies of field samples to assess the methylotrophic populations              
              (with gene probes), compare the substrate utilization kinetics, and            
              determine how the natural populations respond to perturbations such            
              as changes in growth rate or nutrient concentrations.  Predictive              
              models will be generated from the laboratory data, tested with                 
              field samples (soil and water), then refined by further laboratory             
              work and retesting.  This comprehensive approach will define how               
              these activities are expressed in natural samples and result in                
              mechanistically-based predictive models with immediate applications            
              to bioremediation and global trace gas modeling.
