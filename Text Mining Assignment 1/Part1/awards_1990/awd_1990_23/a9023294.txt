Abstract    :
              Professors Epstein and Kustin are supported by a grant from the                
              Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to continue                    
              their research in the area of oscillating chemical reactions.                  
              Reactions of this type are not only of an academic interest,                   
              but are also of key importance in biological processes such as                 
              those involved in heart function.                                              
                                                                                             
              Epstein and Kustin will conduct research in four primary areas                 
              including: 1) The design of oscillatory reactions involving new                
              chemistry not typically found in current day oscillating                       
              reactions; 2) Mechanistic investigations of oscillatory systems                
              conducted both by experiment and by computer simulation; 3) The                
              probing of complex dynamical phenomena in excitable media                      
              including spatial wave propagation, spatial pattern formation,                 
              and light induced oscillatory behavior; and 4) The study of                    
              coupled oscillatory chemical reactions.                                        
                                                                                             
              Professors Epstein and Kustin also plan to host Professor                      
              Anatol M. Zhabotinskii from the National Scientific Center of                  
              Hematology in Moscow, USSR, during the first year of this                      
              grant. Dr. Zhabotinskii is one of the co-discoverers of the                    
              famous Belousov-Zhabotinskii (BZ) oscillating chemical reaction                
              which forms the basis for much of the experimental research in                 
              this field.
