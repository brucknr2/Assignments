Abstract    :
              At the most general level, Professor Shapin's project is a                     
              naturalistic inquiry into the grounds of credibility in science.               
              It has, therefore, a general philosophical question at its core.               
              But unlike most philosophical projects, it addresses the problem               
              of credibility from the perspectives of the sociology of                       
              knowledge, work and organizations, and it uses detailed materials              
              from a particular historical setting:  the culture of                          
              observational and experimental natural science in seventeenth                  
              century England.  Professor Shapin intends to display in his                   
              study the small-scale processes by which judgments of the truth                
              or falsity of claims about the natural world were rendered.  In                
              the course of the inquiry, he argues for the irreducible role of               
              trust and authority in the constitution of scientific knowledge                
              and he advances a case for viewing knowledge and social order as               
              produced together.
