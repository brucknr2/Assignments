Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program                 
              will help the Department of Chemistry at SUNY Albany acquire a                 
              300 MHz spectrometer which will be used in research                            
              investigations in the following areas of chemistry:                            
              organosulfur chemistry, synthetic organofluorine chemistry,                    
              synthesis of polynuclear antibiotics, clay catalysis of organic                
              reactions, chemical diffusion in polymeric materials and                       
              studies of the enzyme Endonuclease III.  In each of these areas                
              knowledge of structure is essential for understanding the                      
              reactions and properties of the materials.                                     
                                                                                             
              Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy is the most                      
              powerful tool available to the chemist for the elucidation of                  
              the structure of molecules.  It is used to identify unknown                    
              substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within                 
              molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between                   
              molecules in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR                         
              spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out                     
              frontier research.  The results from these NMR studies are                     
              useful in areas such as polymers and catalysis, and in biology.
