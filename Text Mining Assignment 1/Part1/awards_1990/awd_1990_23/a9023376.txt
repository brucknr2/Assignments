Abstract    :
              The Rosensteil School of the University of Miami will                          
              receive renewed support for "Operation SWAB."  Upon                            
              request from a ship or laboratory operator, personnel                          
              from the U. of Miami tritium laboratory will travel to                         
              and test the facilities for radioactive spills at very                         
              low levels.  A detailed report on background contamina-                        
              tion will be provided and advice will be offered on how                        
              best to clean affected areas.  The aim is to provide safe                      
              and effective operation of on-board and on-site sampling                       
              for radioactive tracers.  The methods are 100 times more                       
              sensitive than safety and health-related radiation                             
              control regulations require.  This sensitivity is                              
              necessary because of the extremely low levels of trace                         
              radioactivity in ocean, atmospheric, and polar ice core                        
              samples.  Operation SWAB can assure facility operators                         
              and users that background radiation levels are                                 
              appropriate for conducting a range of NSF-sponsored                            
              investigations involving natural and anthropogenic                             
              isotope distributions in the oceans, atmosphere, and                           
              polar ice caps.
