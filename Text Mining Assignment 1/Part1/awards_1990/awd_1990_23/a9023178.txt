Abstract    :
              This award, made under the Small Grants for Exploratory Research               
              Program, will permit Dr. David Koo, one of the countries leading               
              young observers, and a Presidential Young Investigator, to make a              
              pilot study to test whether there are large scale density                      
              regularities in the distribution of galaxies.  Dr. Koo has reported            
              some evidence for such regularities, but further confirmation is               
              required of such a controversial effect.
