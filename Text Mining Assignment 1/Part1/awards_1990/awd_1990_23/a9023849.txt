Abstract    :
              A new class of thermotropic, main-chain poly(ether-amide)s will be             
              prepared in both deuterated and nondeuterated forms as model                   
              polymers for the investigation of diffusion behavior in liquid-                
              crystalline (LC) polymer melts.  The target polymers will be                   
              prepared by melt polymerization and peptide synthesis methods with             
              sufficiently high molecular weights to form entangled melts in the             
              isotropic state.  The mesophase properties of these polymers will              
              be evaluated.  Forward recoil spectrometry (FRES) will be used to              
              determine the concentration profiles of these interdiffusing LC                
              polymer chains.  Both tracer and self-diffusion studies of LC                  
              polymer chains in their smectic, nematic, and isotropic phases will            
              be undertaken.  The effect of the degree of chain orientation                  
              induced by poling in either magnetic or electric fields will also              
              be explored for its effect on the LC polymer diffusion                         
              characteristics.  Collaborations are planned which will further                
              characterize these thermotropic polymers using rheological                     
              measurements.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              This research is part of an ongoing effort in several laboratories             
              to understand the behavior of LC polymer, which have increasing use            
              as structural materials.
