Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Neurotransmitters and neurohormones are released from a neuron or              
              endocrine cell primarily through the process of exocytosis.                    
              Central to this process is the calcium-dependent fusion of a                   
              small, membrane-limited vesicle with the outer membrane of the                 
              cell.  Two immediate consequences of this fusion are the release               
              of the vesicle contents (transmitter or hormone) into the extra-               
              cellular space and an increase in the surface area of the cell.                
              This project will provide basic information about the mechanism                
              of transmitter release by exploiting recent technical advances to              
              measure these minute changes in cell surface area.  Using the                  
              adrenal chromaffin cell as a model system and triggering release               
              by brief changes in the electrical potential across the cell                   
              membrane, this project will provide new information about the                  
              quantitative relationship between calcium and transmitter                      
              release.
