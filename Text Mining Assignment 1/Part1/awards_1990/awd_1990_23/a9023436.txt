Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project addresses the generation and multiplication of                    
              dislocations during the growth of cubic, cylindrical crystals of               
              Silicon, Gallium Arsenide, and Indium Phosphide which are pulled               
              from the melt by the Czochralski or the liquid-encapsulated-                   
              Czochralski method.  Emphasis in on the                                        
              computation of thermal stresses during high temperature                        
              deformation.  Three major effects will be studied: 1)the shape of              
              the solid-liquid interface between the melt and crystal, whose                 
              control may greatly reduce the resulting thermal stresses, 2)the               
              crystalline anisotropy in relation to the direction of crystal                 
              growth, whose proper choice may minimize the resulting dislocation             
              density for a given amount of crystalline anisotropy, and                      
              3)dislocation generation and multiplication by using high                      
              temperature inelastic constitutive laws which treat the dislocation            
              density as an internal variable and allow for its microstructural              
              evolution.  New qualitative and quantitative understanding of                  
              fundamental processes important to bulk single crystal growth in               
              semiconductors is anticipated from this project; the results also              
              have technological relevance to the microelectronics industry.
