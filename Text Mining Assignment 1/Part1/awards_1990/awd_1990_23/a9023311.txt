Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The recipient of this FAW award is a leader in the field of                    
              Marine Chemical Ecology.  Her proposed research during the next                
              five years will involve using techniques of natural products                   
              chemistry to address ecological and biochemical questions of                   
              tropical marine plant.herbivore interactions. Her focus will be                
              on the importance of biological and physical causes of variation               
              in the production of secondary metabolites by tropical seaweeds.               
              The research is expected to provide important information on                   
              chemical variation and its causes, the ability of seaweeds to                  
              change their allocation of chemical defenses, the time scale for               
              facultative chemical changes, and ecological relationships                     
              between seaweeds and tropical herbivores.
