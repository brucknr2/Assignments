Abstract    :
              A research workshop will be held at the                                        
              University of Wisconsin-Madison on                                             
              November 12-13, 1990.  This workshop topic                                     
              is "The Impact of a Less Regulated Utility                                     
              Environment on Power System Control and                                        
              Security".  This workshop will bring together                                  
              approximately 35 individuals from academic                                     
              and research institutions to examine the                                       
              consequences that a less regulated, more                                       
              distributed utility environment will have for                                  
              research directions in electric power systems.                                 
              In particular, the impact of structural                                        
              changes on the nature of power system                                          
              control as well as likely changes in the                                       
              methodologies for maintaining secure and                                       
              reliable power.  The workshop will be                                          
              organized around five major panel                                              
              discussions, with an organizer and a small                                     
              panel making presentations and leading                                         
              discussion in each session.  Participants will                                 
              be asked to prepare a short "brainstorming"                                    
              paper for distribution during the workshop                                     
              to stimulate discussion in these sessions.                                     
                                                                                             
              Each panel will collaborate on producing a                                     
              summary paper from the panel's work and                                        
              from discussion, for inclusion in a workshop                                   
              proceedings.  The workshop organizers at                                       
              the University of Wisconsin will assemble                                      
              these proceedings and produce 400 copies                                       
              for distribution to document the results of                                    
              the workshop.
