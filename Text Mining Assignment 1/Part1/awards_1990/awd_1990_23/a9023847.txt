Abstract    :
              The Archean rock of West Greenland represent some of the                       
              best-exposed, best-studied, oldest rocks known and thus                        
              constitute a prime target for crustal reflection studies.                      
              Interpretation of crustal reflection data has attained its                     
              greatest success where "deep" seismic data was correlated                      
              with surface geology.  The Archean of West Greenland is thus                   
              an excellent geophysical target because of its exposure and                    
              age that allows the study of early crustal processes.  This                    
              award supports the interpretation of a recently completed                      
              gravity study in the area and a combined gravity and                           
              magnetic investigation.  The research is a cooperative                         
              project between Norwegian, Danish, and U.S. scientists.                        
              Problems being addressed by this research include:                             
              1) continuation of the deformation zone to depth, 2) crustal                   
              shortening and mode of deformation, 3) role of volatiles in                    
              the deep crust, 4) change in Moho depth, 5) Archean crustal                    
              development, and 6) nature of deep crust under granulities.
