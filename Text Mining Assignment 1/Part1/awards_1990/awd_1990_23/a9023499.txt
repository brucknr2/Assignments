Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research of Professor J. Shalika                  
              to work in automorphic functions.  He intends to work on                       
              applications of the double trace formula to forms on GSp(4).                   
              He also intends to work on generalizations of the Rankin-                      
              Selberg method.                                                                
                   Modular forms arose out of Non-Euclidean geometry in the                  
              middle of the nineteenth century.  Both mathematicians and                     
              physicists have thus long realized that many objects of                        
              fundamental importance are non-Euclidean in their basic                        
              nature.  This field is principally concerned with questions                    
              about the whole numbers, but in its use of geometry and                        
              analysis, it retains connection to its historical roots and                    
              thus to problems in areas as diverse as gauge theory in                        
              theoretical physics and coding theory in information theory.
