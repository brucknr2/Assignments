Abstract    :
              CuInSe2 has been targeted as the major photovoltaic                            
              material, but the efforts at utilizing its optimum                             
              properties have not been extended to n-CuInSe2 due                             
              to lack of an appropriate p-type window material.  In                          
              Phase I, we established the feasibility of fabricating                         
              a new n-CuInSe2-based thin film solar cell by using a                          
              novel concept of electrochemical surface conversion                            
              to p-(CuIn2Se3I)-CuISe3 to form of a n/p                                       
              heterojunction.  The cell performance was primarily                            
              determined by the quality of the n-CuInSe2 films and                           
              to a lesser extent by the window layer growth                                  
              parameters.  The window layer composition and                                  
              morphology can be controlled with electrolyte                                  
              composition.  The Phase II effort is aimed at in-                              
              depth investigation of the properties n-CuInSe2 and                            
              the window layer, the surface conversion mechanism                             
              and the opto-electronic properties of the n/p                                  
              junction.  These studies are essential for the                                 
              development and optimization of the cell components,                           
              processing and operation.  In addition to processing,                          
              cost and environmental advantages, inherent in this                            
              simple electrochemical approach to heterojunction                              
              formation, several other benefits are anticipated for                          
              the title cell over the present p-CuInSe2/n-CdS cell.                          
              Optimum lattice match between CuInSe2 and                                      
              CuIn2Se3I transition layer, low interface state density,                       
              higher electron mobility in n-type absorber, improved                          
              adhesion to ITO/Glass substrate, greater stability due                         
              to similar components (except I) on both sides of the                          
              junction should lead to a more efficient and stable                            
              solar cell.
