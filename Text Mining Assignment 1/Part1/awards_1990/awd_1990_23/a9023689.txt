Abstract    :
                   This Faculty Award for Women Scientists and Engineers is                  
              made to Dr. Mei-Chu Chang of the Department of Mathematics,                    
              University of California, Riverside.  Dr. Chang will continue her              
              work in the area of Algebraic Geometry.  In particular, she will               
              work on Hartshorne's conjecture, classification of codimension 2               
              subvarieties in Pn for n = 4 and 5, the geometry of Mg, and                    
              deformation of projective varieties.                                           
                   The NSF Faculty Award for Women recognizes the high quality               
              of the awardee's record in teaching and scholarship as well as                 
              potential for continued significant contributions to scientific                
              research, the academic profession, and the education of future                 
              scientists.  Dr. Chang will continue her work in the area of                   
              mathematics called Algebraic Geometry.  Particularly noteworthy                
              is her leadership is the growth of research in this area in her                
              department.
