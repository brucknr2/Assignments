Abstract    :
                 Dr. Hirsch is a leading investigator in the area of the                     
              nitrogen-fixing symbiosis between leguminous roots and the                     
              rhizobial bacteria which colonize them.  The problem being                     
              addressed is that of cell division factors produced by the bacteria            
              which elicit morphological changes in root hairs.                              
                                                                                             
              This award is a National Science Foundation Faculty Award for Women            
              Scientists and Engineers.  The proposal fulfills the FAW                       
              objectives, which are: 1, to recognize outstanding and promising               
              women scientists and engineers in academic careers of research and             
              teaching and 2, to facilitate the further development of their                 
              careers.
