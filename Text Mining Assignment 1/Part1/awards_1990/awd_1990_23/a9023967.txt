Abstract    :
              This proposal focusses on the traditional travel culture of the                
              Inupiat Eskimo of northern Alaska and the effects of recent                    
              cultural changes on travel behavior and spatial skills. Included               
              in the study will be an analysis of how travel skills are passed               
              on to the younger generation who do not have the same subsistence              
              pressures as earlier generations. Special attention will be given              
              to disorientation experiences. Extensive interviews will be carried            
              out in the communities of Barrow, Wainwright and Anaktuvuk Pass.               
                                                                                             
              The significance of the study rests partly in the urgency of                   
              recording traditional knowledge which is rapidly disappearing, and             
              partly in analyzing how modern technology and culture have altered             
              travel culture in the Arctic. Travel and orientation knowledge was             
              a key element of survival in the past. Today, modern technology has            
              enabled rapid transportation but the loss of survival skills has               
              drastically increased the incidence of accidental death among the              
              Eskimo.
