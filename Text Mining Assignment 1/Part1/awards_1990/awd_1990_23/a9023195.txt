Abstract    :
                   This project focuses on elliptic variational problems,                    
              parabolic variational inequalities, equimeasurable convex                      
              symmetrization, variational integrals involving mappings of bounded            
              variation, and nonlinear potential theory.  Much of the proposer's             
              recent work in the area of elliptic variational problems has                   
              concentrated on problems involving the regularity of solutions to              
              variational inequalities that arise from both irregular and smooth             
              obstacles and that involve degenerate elliptic operators.  An                  
              approach has been developed that may yield more information about              
              the free boundary in the case of smooth obstacles and it may lead              
              also to another treatment in the case of elliptic systems.  These              
              questions and techniques lead to their parabolic counterparts in               
              parabolic variational inequalities where less is known and the                 
              difficulties are greater.  Many of the questions and techniques in             
              elliptic variational problems, and parabolic variational                       
              inequalities have considerable overlap with those in nonlinear                 
              potential theory.  The proposer finds the problems of                          
              equimeasurable convex symmetrization and variational integrals                 
              involving mappings of bounded variation especially compelling                  
              because of their interaction with geometric analysis and the                   
              promise of going further in the direction of applied areas.
