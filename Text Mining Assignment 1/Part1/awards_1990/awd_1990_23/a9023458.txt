Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Advances in sub-micron lithograpy have opened the door to the             
              study of the physics of the "mesoscopic" size regime.  This regime             
              is characterized by quantum-interference effects enhanced                      
              electrical conductance is extremely sensitive to the microscopic               
              impurity potential, hence careful conductance measurements can be              
              used to detect the motions of single atoms.                                    
                                                                                             
                   Conductance measurements will be used to study defects in                 
              metals and their relation to l/f noise, and tunneling systems in               
              metallic glasses.  Our understanding in both of these areas has                
              been limited by our inability to observe the microscopic samples.              
              By measuring conductance fluctuations in submicron samples as a                
              function of sample size, temperature and strain, and of the applied            
              magnetic field, one will probe the properties of individual defects            
              and tunneling systems, as well as their interactions with each                 
              other and with the conduction electrons.
