Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project has two overall goals:  (a) to                                    
              develop basic experimental data on the                                         
              torsional-translational response of                                            
              reinforced concrete structures in order to                                     
              test the theory and improve numerical models                                   
              for nonlinear behavior and (b) to seek                                         
              relatively simple methods of representing the                                  
              problem for design applications.  Results of                                   
              the experimental work will be evaluated by                                     
              studies toward the goals indicated using                                       
              nonlinear and modified linear models to                                        
              represent observed behavior.  Both dynamic                                     
              interaction and material interaction                                           
              affecting the coupled structural response                                      
              will be investigated.                                                          
                                                                                             
              The experiments involve a specially designed                                   
              specimen which is free to rotate about its                                     
              horizontal and vertical axes.  The tendencies                                  
              for rotation about Y and X are resisted by                                     
              reinforced concrete beams.  The inertia force                                  
              is eccentric with respect to the vertical                                      
              axis.  The specimen configuration and the                                      
              associated experimental setup permits the                                      
              independent variation of mass, stiffness, and                                  
              strength from specimen to specimen.  Study                                     
              will include earthquake-simulation testing of                                  
              eight specimens to investigate the effects of                                  
              type of earthquake motion, stiffness, and                                      
              strength on combined torsional-translational                                   
              response.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              The project targets at the intersection of                                     
              theory and experiments, and through                                            
              deliberately simple design of the test setup,                                  
              tests existing theories and makes                                              
              straightforward dynamic modeling possible.
