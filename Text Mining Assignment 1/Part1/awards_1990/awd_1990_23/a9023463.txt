Abstract    :
                 Dr. Baird is a leading investigator in the area of the                      
              biophysics and biochemistry of receptor-mediated signal                        
              transduction in mast cells.  The problem being addressed is the                
              development of a general method for visually observing (by                     
              fluorescence microscopy) a few individual receptors on a single                
              living cell.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              This award is a National Science Foundation Faculty Award for Women            
              Scientists and Engineers.  The proposal fulfills the FAW                       
              objectives, which are: 1, to recognize outstanding and promising               
              women scientists and engineers in academic careers of research and             
              teaching and 2, to facilitate the further development of their                 
              careers.
