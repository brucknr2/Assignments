Abstract    :
              This project studies the effects of similarity on individual                   
              judgement and choice.  Three sets of experiments are proposed.                 
              The first set of experiments investigates multiattribute stimuli               
              with similar levels along one dimension and dissimilar levels on               
              another.  The hypothesis that similarity along one dimension will              
              enhance differences along another dimension is tested.  The                    
              second set of experiments investigates the effect of the stimulus              
              range on attribute importance.  The hypothesis that similarity                 
              along a stimulus dimension will decrease the importance of that                
              dimension is tested.  The third set of studies examines                        
              similarity between stimulus and response scales and tests the                  
              conjecture that when a stimulus dimension is more closely related              
              to the response scale, that stimulus will receive greater weight               
              to the extent that it is perceived to be more valid.  When the                 
              validity of the stimulus is unconfounded with response scale                   
              similarity, the more valid cue is weighted more heavily.                       
                                                                                             
              By contributing to a better understanding of how individuals                   
              evaluate multiattribute items, this project may lead to more                   
              realistic models of individual valuation for use in decision                   
              making, marketing and voting.
