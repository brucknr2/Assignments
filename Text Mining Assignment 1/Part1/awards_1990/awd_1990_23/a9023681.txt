Abstract    :
              Dr. Goss' research goals are understanding the regulation of                   
              protein synthesis and protein-nucleic acid interactions.  She will             
              likely use her FAW award to measure rates and interactions of                  
              prokaryotic translocation in order to answer several questions                 
              about the mechanism of this process.  Since these experiments                  
              require characterization of several components and a number of                 
              difficult kinetic measurements, it is likely to take several years             
              to yield significant answers to these mechanistic questions.                   
                                                                                             
              This proposal fulfills the FAW objectives which are 1) to recognize            
              outstanding and promising women scientists and engineers in                    
              academic careers of research and teaching and 2) to facilitate the             
              further development of their careers.
