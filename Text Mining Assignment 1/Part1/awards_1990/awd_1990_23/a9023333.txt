Abstract    :
              The potential of computers is limited by how effectively users                 
              can access their computing power via the user interface.  This                 
              research attacks the problem of usability by fundamental                       
              improvements to the interface development process.  It aims at a               
              new generation of behaviorally-oriented techniques for                         
              representing the details for the interaction between users and                 
              systems.  Interactions are represented by means of a User                      
              Interface Notation (UAN) which is being developed for                          
              communication among persons with various professional backgrounds              
              involved in various phases of the development cycle of a specific              
              interface. Experiments will be performed to evaluate an existing               
              UAN and to develop criteria for new features and capabilities of               
              the notation.  A theoretical analyses will be done based on                    
              cognitive theory and relating the approach to other work in                    
              human-computer interactions.  The results will be integrated into              
              a set of coherent requirements for the next generation of a UAN.               
              The requirements will then form the basis for the development of               
              tools which use the revised UAN.  The tools include an editor and              
              tools to generate code and skeletal user documentation from a UAN
