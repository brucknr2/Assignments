Abstract    :
              This is a project to study the ability of biologically                         
              active filters to absorb, adsorb and stabilize volatile                        
              organic compounds that are emitted from industrial and                         
              municipal waste processing systems.  Experimentation in                        
              this project initially involves passage of synthetic gas                       
              streams containing trichloroethylene through a                                 
              biologically active medium that initially will be enriched                     
              for favoring methanotrophic microbial organisms.  Other                        
              organic compounds to be included include 1,2                                   
              dichloroethylene, benzene and toluene.                                         
                                                                                             
              This proposal was submitted in accord with the NSF Program

              Institutions.  Previous efforts to remove volatile organic                     
              compounds from process streams to reduce their emission to                     
              the air have demonstrated the efficacy of                                      
              physical/chemical systems.  The physical/biological                            
              process this research addresses has promise of removing                        
              the potential air pollutants from gases prior to their                         
              being exhausted to the atmosphere at significantly.
