Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a proposal for a research program to study the role of                 
              interfaces in superplastic deformation and cavitation failure in               
              ceramics. Superplastic forming offers the potential for near-net-              
              shape processing of relatively complex shapes from viable                      
              structural ceramics. The propensity to cavitate during deformation,            
              however, is one aspect of superplasticity that need to be better               
              understood for this technique to gain prominence in ceramic                    
              processing. The proposed research addresses the critical issues                
              relating to the cavitation problem. The PI intends to study the                
              nucleation and growth of cavities during superplastic deformation              
              as a function of the properties of the grain boundary phase. The               
              research will include the in-house processing of controlled                    
              microstructures for the superplastic deformation studies.
