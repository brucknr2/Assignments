Abstract    :
              This research will focus on fundamental issues in parallel algorithm           
              design for graph-theoretic problems.  Parallel algorithms for the              
              following problems will be developed:                                          
                                                                                             
                o  Basic problems on directed graphs, and the elimination of the             
                   transitive closure bottleneck.                                            
                                                                                             
                o  The maximum matching problem, the maximum flow problem, and the           
                   blocking flow problem.                                                    
                                                                                             
                o  Incremental problems.  These are problems in which an input graph         
                   with certain properties is given, but these properties may change         
                   due to the addition or deletion of an edge or vertex.  These              
                   problems are of importance in the evaluation of a dynamically             
                   changing network.                                                         
                                                                                             
                o  Bucket sort.  This is the sorting problem when the inputs are             
                   restricted to be integers of polynomial size.  While this is not          
                   a graph problem, it occurs as a subroutine in most graph                  
                   algorithms, and is often the limiting factor in their efficiency.         
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
              These new algorithms will be developed in the shared-memory PRAM model         
              and their implementations on other standard models of parallel                 
              computation will be considered.  The development of new improved               
              sequential algorithms from these new parallel algorithms will be               
              investigated.
