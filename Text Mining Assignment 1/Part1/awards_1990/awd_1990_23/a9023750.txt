Abstract    :
              The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will acquire                          
              items of oceanographic instrumentation to be placed in a pool                  
              of shared use equipment.  This equipment is maintained for                     
              use on or in association with the three research vessels                       
              operated by the Institution.  A substantial part of the                        
              ships' operating schedules in recent years and again in 1991                   
              is in support of NSF-sponsored research projects.  The                         
              instrumentation will also increase the capabilities of the                     
              ships and of the institution to support research and                           
              engineering activities.  The instrumentation includes:                         
                                                                                             
              -An integrated meteorological sensor and data system (IMET).
