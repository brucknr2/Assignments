Abstract    :
              The Southern Technology Council is taking a necessary first step               
              toward implementing the recommendations set forth in its report                
              Turning to Technology, a long-range strategic plan for strengthe-              
              ning the S&T capabilities of the South.  The necessary first step              
              is to bring the plan to the attention of state legislators and                 
              representatives of relevant organizations throughout the South.                
              The Council proposes to do this through one day symposia that                  
              will be highly publicized.  The symposia will relate the                       
              strategic plan to state-specific needs and conditions, stimulate               
              consideration and discussions of priorities, and will prompt the               
              formation of permanent planning mechanisms and legislative                     
              structures for state S&T policy.
