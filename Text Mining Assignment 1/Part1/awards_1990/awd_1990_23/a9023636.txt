Abstract    :
              In this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and                            
              Organometallic Program of the Chemistry Division, Pierpont will                
              continue studies on transition metal complexes that contain                    
              electroactive organic ligands.  The synthesis and                              
              characterization of transition metal complexes that contain                    
              catecholate, semiquinone, and related electroactive organic                    
              ligands will be pursued.  These complexes exhibit selective                    
              redox activity at either the metal or ligand, thus allowing                    
              investigation of intramolecular metal-quinone electron transfer                
              reactions.  The photochemical and photophysical properties of                  
              quinone complexes of the platinum group metals will be                         
              examined.  Multinuclear complex ensembles will be investigated                 
              for their activity as catalysts in photoconversion processes.                  
              Electronic effects in intramolecular metal-quinone electron                    
              transfer reactions and their potential involvement with                        
              bioinorganic reactions will be studied in functional models for                
              metalloenzymatic processes.                                                    
              %%%                                                                            
              Catechols, quinones and other quinoid molecules are common                     
              components of biological systems, in which they usually                        
              function in association with metal ions.   In some cases these                 
              molecules function in the binding and transport of metals, and                 
              in other cases their metal complexes have a role in electron                   
              transfer and/or substrate activation.  The semiquinone and                     
              catecholate metal complexes which will be synthesized in this                  
              project will serve as models of the similar natural molecules.
