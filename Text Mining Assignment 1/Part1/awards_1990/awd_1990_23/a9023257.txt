Abstract    :
                   This Faculty Award for Women Scientists and Engineers is                  
              made to Dr. Anna Hasenfratz of the Physics Department, the                     
              University of Arizona.  Dr. Hasenfratz will continue                           
              investigations of field theoretical models, especially those                   
              involving lattice calculations.                                                
                   The NSF Faculty Award for Women recognizes the high                       
              quality of the awardee's record in teaching and scholarship as                 
              well as potential for continued significant contributions to                   
              scientific research, the academic profession, and the                          
              education of future scientists.  Particularly noteworthy                       
              achievements are Dr. Hasenfratz's teaching of graduate-level                   
              courses, and her research in theoretical physics.
