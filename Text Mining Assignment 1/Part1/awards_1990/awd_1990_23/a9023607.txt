Abstract    :
              This research is concerned with the                                            
              basic physical, electronic and                                                 
              material properties of multi-

              traps are located in the silicon

              the physical mechanisms by which                                               
              charge injection, transport and

              device structures.  The origin and

              as well as the examination of

              particular, we propose to                                                      
              investigate a new SONOS device

              show great promise for low voltage
