Abstract    :
              Among the best documented empirical regularities in criminology is             
              the positive association between past and future criminality.  One             
              interpretation of this association (termed state dependence) is                
              that prior criminal involvement actually increases future criminal             
              propensity.  Another (termed population heterogeneity) is that the             
              association is not a reflection of a causal relationship but rather            
              is attributable to persistent differences across individuals in                
              their propensity to engage in crime.  One or the other of these                
              interpretations is suggested by many competing general theories of             
              crime.  Yet there has been little research attempting to                       
              distinguish these two fundamentally different explanations.                    
                                                                                             
              This project will statistically distinguish the relative importance            
              of the two explanations for the observed positive correlation                  
              between past and future criminality.  Two widely known panel data              
              sets will be used for the research--the National Youth Survey of               
              U.S. youths and the Farrington and West longitudinal survey of                 
              English males.  Not only will this research address the relative               
              contributions of state dependence and heterogeneity in explaining              
              the positive association of past to future delinquency/criminality,            
              but also it will illuminate the nature of the association of a                 
              variety of individual, familial, and behavioral factors to criminal            
              involvement.  Thus, the research will make important contributions             
              to extant general theories of crime.
