Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary objective of this U.S.-Poland research project between             
              Dr. Roy Glauber of Harvard University and Dr. Maciej Lewenstein                
              of the Polish Academy of Science's Institute for Theoretical                   
              Physics is to examine problems of photodetection within a                      
              dielectric medium and on radiative interactions of single atoms or             
              ions .  The researchers will continue their efforts to develop the             
              theoretical framework for treatment of optically pumped and                    
              dielectric media and use it to demonstrate novel quantum                       
              mechanical effects in photon counting distributions and related                
              correlation functions.  Results may yield a new method of photon               
              detection that can be used to investigate several quantum                      
              phenomena, such as quantum mechanical tunneling, effects of                    
              cavity resonances, influence of spatial wave packets, and the                  
              radiative interactions of ion pairs.                                           
                                                                                             
              This project in theoretical physics fulfills the program objective of          
              advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the              
              United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary                      
              talents and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual                  
              interest and competence.
