Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The recipient of this FAW Award is a leader in interdisciplinary               
              research on benthic boundary flows, optics and particle                        
              concentrations. During this five year award she participate in                 
              the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE), a program to                    
              describe and understand the global ocean circulation, its decadal              
              changes and its influence on climate. Her specific interest is                 
              studying the sources and sinks of particles in the ocean and the               
              transformation and transport process from production or                        
              introduction into the ocean to final incorporation into the                    
              sediments. WOCE will provide and opportunity to measure the                    
              variability of particulate matter concentration (PMC) throughout               
              all oceans during the next decade. She plans to plot the data in               
              real time from transmissometers, which respond to changes in                   
              particles in the water column and CTDs, which measure                          
              Conductivity, Temperature and Depth, for selected WOCE cruises.                
              The near term emphasis will be on the Pacific Ocean.
