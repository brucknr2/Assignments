Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project consists of two parts.  The first is a theoretical and            
              empirical investigation of the role of endogenous debt constraints             
              in determining consumption, and the impact of such constraints on              
              asset market pricing.  The second part is a theoretical                        
              investigation of learning in games.  There is a loose connection               
              between the two parts in the sense that learning is potentially an             
              important explanation for such asset market phenomena as                       
              speculative bubbles.                                                           
                                                                                             
              This research is very significant because it bridges two very                  
              different literatures on credit markets: the incomplete markets                
              literature and contract theory.  The synthesis of these two                    
              literatures produces models that capture both approaches as special            
              cases.  The preliminary theoretical and empirical results give                 
              different efficiency and policy implications than the more                     
              traditional approaches.
