Abstract    :
              The purpose of this research is to analyze the economic behavior               
              of the American industrial economy during the period 1929-1935.                
              This period spans the largest decline in demand ever to strike                 
              the manufacturing sector of the economy.  Understanding the                    
              response of the economy to this dramatic decline in demand, both               
              in output markets and the labor markets is of enormous analytic                
              importance and central to understanding the Great Depression.                  
                                                                                             
              A new data set will be assembled which consists of individual-                 
              plant data form the Census of Manufacturing for 1929, 1931, 1933,              
              and 1935.  These data are far finer than any extant data set for               
              the period, and establishment-level micro-data such as these will              
              be used to analyze the response of the output and labor markets                
              to the severe down turn in aggregate demand experienced during                 
              that period.  The project will create establishment panel data                 
              sets for a variety of important industries.  In addition, the                  
              rich information on the Census schedules will link in extra-                   
              Censal information about the firms owning the establishments and               
              about the technology employed by the firms.  This project is                   
              important because it will provide new information and insights                 
              about the contraction of the economy during the Great Depression.
