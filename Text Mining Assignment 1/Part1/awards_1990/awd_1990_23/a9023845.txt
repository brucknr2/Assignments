Abstract    :
              This award is for support of a 3 year interdisciplinary                        
              project to study ice-water equilibrium and transport                           
              phenomena in porous media and at ice-vapor surfaces.  The                      
              experiments will be designed in the light of recent advances                   
              in the basic physics of surface melting and the extensive                      
              literature on unfrozen water in porous soils and rocks.                        
              Theoretical studies and laboratory measurements will be                        
              intergrated to achieve an understanding of the factors which                   
              influence the formation of unfrozen water films between ice                    
              and various mineral surfaces.  This research has widespread                    
              practical applications including better understanding of the                   
              disruption of man-made structures due to frost heaving,                        
              frost-induced damage to concrete and other porous materials,                   
              and ice bonding to roads and other surfaces.
