Abstract    :
              The School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology at the                    
              University of Hawaii will acquire several items of oceano-                     
              graphic instrumentation to be placed in a pool of shared use                   
              equipment.  This equipment is maintained for use on or in                      
              association with the research vessels and facilities operated                  
              by the University.  A large part of the ships' operating                       
              schedule during 1991 is in support of NSF-sponsored research                   
              projects.  The instrumentation will also increase the                          
              capabilities of the ship and of the University to support                      
              research and engineering activities.  The instrumentation                      
              includes:                                                                      
                                                                                             
              -Newly developed Continuous Profiling System that will                         
               provide a range of environmental data at a long-term                          
               offshore sampling site,                                                       
              -Shipboard computer upgrade and optical data recording device                  
               for increasing shared-use, sea-going computing capabilities,                  
              -precision graphic recorder for displaying acoustically                        
               derived data of seafloor bathymetry and sedimentary                           
               profiles, and                                                                 
              -precision audio frequency signal source for calibrating and                   
               testing seagoing acoustic instruments.                                        
                                                                                             
              The instrumentation described above will increase the                          
              capability of the University to support NSF-sponsored                          
              research and engineering projects.
