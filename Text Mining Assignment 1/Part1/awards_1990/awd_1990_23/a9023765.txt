Abstract    :
              The Department of Oceanography at Texas A&M University will                    
              acquire a new precision salinometer as a replacement for                       
              one that is beyond practical repair.  The device will will                     
              be added to a pool of oceanographic instrumentation that is                    
              maintained for use on or in association with the R/V GYRE,                     
              a research vessel that is operated by the University.  A                       
              substantial part of the ship's operating schedule has been                     
              in support of NSF-sponsored research projects.  The                            
              instrumentation will increase the capabilities of the ship                     
              and of the University to support research and engineering                      
              activities.
