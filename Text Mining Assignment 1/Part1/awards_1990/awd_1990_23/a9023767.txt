Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Preliminary funding evidence and anectodal information are causing             
              a great deal of concern in academic, government and industrial                 
              circles that increasing numbers of young people may be discouraged             
              from careers in academic biological and biomedical research because            
              of the difficulty that investigators are having in obtaining                   
              funding.  Young investigators are critical for the expansion of the            
              fundamental biological knowledge base ranging from ecology to                  
              medicine.  This knowledge fuels academic, industrial and economic              
              growth.  The Commission on Life Sciences of the National Research              
              Council proposes to examine the funding issue by convening a                   
              committee of experts.  While it is not the intent of this activity             
              to reinvestigate pipeline issues, the committee will review this               
              subject where relevant to this study.  The committee will                      
              specifically address current funding mechanisms for young                      
              investigators in the biological and biomedical sciences by major               
              federal agencies and private organizations, the current state of               
              funding by these entities, and the major problems and constraints              
              in the funding system.  The committee will determine the impact of             
              these issues on the ability to recruit and retain young researchers            
              in academics and will report the details of each point and include             
              recommendations on ways to improve their funding situation in a                
              report.  This project is expected to take 15 months, at an                     
              estimated cost of $373,410 derived from federal and private                    
              sources.  An award of $25,000 is recommended.
