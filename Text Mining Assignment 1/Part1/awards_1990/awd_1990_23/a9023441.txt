Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research of Professor D. Bump to                  
              work in automorphic functions.  He intends to work on extending                
              the Rankin Selberg method and on new uses of the metaplectic                   
              group.  These include the study of non-unique Whittaker models of              
              theta functions on the n-fold cover of GL(2).                                  
                   Modular forms arose out of Non-Euclidean geometry in the                  
              middle of the nineteenth century.  Both mathematicians and                     
              physicists have thus long realized that many objects of                        
              fundamental importance are non-Euclidean in their basic nature.                
              This field is principally concerned with questions about the                   
              whole numbers, but in its use of geometry and analysis, it                     
              retains connection to its historical roots and thus to problems                
              in areas as diverse as gauge theory in theoretical physics and                 
              coding theory in information theory.
