Abstract    :
                   The construction of appropriate estimators is complicated when            
              data are sampled according to complex rules, or when multiple                  
              measurements with different inherent biases are available.  This               
              research will develop estimation procedures for certain of these               
              cases.  Then their statistical properties will be investigated when            
              sampling is multistage, or when estimates are obtained by combining            
              biased and unbiased estimators.  Constructions of admissible                   
              estimators for spherically symmetric families will also be sought              
              using extensions of James-Stein procedures.
