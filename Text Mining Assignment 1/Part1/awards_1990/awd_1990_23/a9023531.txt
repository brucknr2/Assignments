Abstract    :
              Most game-theoretic applications in economics assume players are               
              rational, mutually rational, and purely self-interested. In                    
              experimental studies of games one or more of these assumptions                 
              often appear to be violated because people do not play Nash or more            
              refined equilibria (learning sometimes reduces violations but not              
              always). It is usually difficult to tell from strategy choices                 
              alone which assumptions a subject is violating. Since game-                    
              theoretic solution concepts can be interpreted as algorithms for               
              choosing a strategy, we can test the algorithms directly using a               
              computer system that records what information in a game (e.g.,                 
              which payoffs) a subject is looking at, and for how long, along                
              with their choices. The information processing data are revealed               
              preferences for information, which can be used to infer an                     
              unobservable thinking process. We can also measure the effect of               
              learning on information processing to see how subjects learn, and              
              whether they learn optimal responses or general principles (e.g.,              
              solution concepts). The games and ideas that will be studied in                
              this project include: sequencing bargaining, forward induction,                
              Nash vs. subgame perfection, and "almost common knowledge" games.
