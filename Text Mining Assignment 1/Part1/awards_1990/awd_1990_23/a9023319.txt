Abstract    :
              This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the research             
              of Professor David Lewis at Colgate University. The results of                 
              this research will provide new understanding to the mechanism of               
              the thermal reactions of small-ring hydrocarbons. The shock tube               
              method will allow high reaction temperatures to be reached (1100               
              K) without the complication of reaction on the reactor wall. New               
              and sophisticated spectroscopic methods will be used to detect                 
              intermediates in these reactions, and from this analysis an                    
              insight to the mechanism of the reaction can be reached.                       
                                                                                             
              The isomerization and fragmentation reactions of small-ring                    
              hydrocarbons will be studied by shock tube and static reactor                  
              techniques. Mechanistic details of these reactions will be probed              
              with state of the art spectroscopic techniques, namely, high                   
              resolution IR absorption spectroscopy, tunable diode laser                     
              methods, and vibrational circular dichroism. Sophisticated                     
              deuterium and carbon-13 labeling experiments will be employed to               
              determine the course of reaction. From these experiments it will               
              be possible to determine if these reactions proceed in a                       
              concerted or stepwise manner, and if orbital symmetry rules are                
              obeyed.
