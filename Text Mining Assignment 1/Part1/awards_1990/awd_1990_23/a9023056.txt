Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This highly theoretical research develops a formal, mathematical               
              model of the interaction between voters and legislators in a                   
              unicameral legislative system.  Most existing formal models of the             
              relationship of voters and legislators deal with a fixed time                  
              period and treat the relationship as one directional.  Voters are              
              assumed to influence legislative behavior or vice versa but not                
              both.  However, because elections and the legislative process are              
              inherently dynamic processes where influence flows both ways                   
              simultaneously, existing models are limited in the questions they              
              can address.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              This research models the representative process as one of                      
              reciprocal influence where decisions by voters influence                       
              decisions by legislators which then influence decisions by voters              
              in the next period. The process continues indefinitely until                   
              equilibrium is achieved.  This means that voters, when they make               
              their decisions, anticipate the reactions of legislators.                      
              Legislators, in turn, anticipate the reaction of voters when                   
              deciding policies.                                                             
                                                                                             
              The project will proceed to use these models to explain the                    
              development of certain common institutional features of                        
              legislatures including political parties, seniority, safe seats                
              and lobbying. When completed this project will greatly strengthen              
              existing theories of representative relationships, enhance their               
              realism, and provide a more systematic and rigorous basis for                  
              evaluating the potential effects of proposed legislative reforms               
              such as legislative terms limits.
