Abstract    :
              The research interests here lie in the general area of compound                
              semiconductor materials and devices.  This research explores novel             
              devices, using unique material characteristics such as quantum and             
              strain effects in compound semiconductors.  Four major directions              
              will be examined.  They are:  device applications of selective                 
              epitaxy, mass transport of compound semiconductors, submillimeter              
              wave technology, and band structure engineering.
