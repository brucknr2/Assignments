Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The fabric (that is, the physical structure) of sand, and the                  
              effect of aging,                                                               
              play a fundamental role in determining the stresses necessary                  
              to trigger liquefaction under earthquake loading.  Recent                      
              observations indicate that changes in sand fabric, as                          
              measured in the field, may result in a rapid initial gain in                   
              stiffness due to aging, but that dynamic loads, such as those                  
              induced by earthquakes, cause this stiffness to degrade.  This                 
              results in significant fluctuations of the sand liquefaction                   
              resistance with time.  It is possible that both physical and                   
              chemical mechanisms may contribute to these age-related                        
              changes in liquefaction resistance.                                            
                                                                                             
              The basic intent of this research project is to investigate in                 
              the laboratory whether beneficial ageing effects on soil fabric                
              can be destroyed by relatively low levels of cyclic strain,                    
              thereby simulating the effects of earthquakes which are                        
              smaller, but more frequent, than the "design earthquake" for                   
              a given site.  The goal is to investigate the earthquake-                      
              induced reversibility of the effects of time on sand fabric,                   
              thereby concluding whether it is a matter of practical                         
              concern in evaluating the liquefaction potential of a given                    
              site.  If this turns out to be the case, it will bring into                    
              question the way in which penetrometer-based design                            
              methods are currently applied, and will further suggest that a                 
              conservative design approach may be to base the                                
              liquefaction potential evaluation on the resistance of the                     
              sand in a freshly-deposited state in the laboratory.
