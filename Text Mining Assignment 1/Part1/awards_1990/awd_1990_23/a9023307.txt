Abstract    :
                   This Faculty Award for Women Scientists and Engineers is                  
              made to Dr. Jolie A. Cizewski of the Physics Department,                       
              Rutgers University.  Dr. Cizewski will continue investigations of              
              the structure of medium- and heavy-mass nuclei by studying the                 
              complete spectrum of excitations of low and moderate angular                   
              momentum.                                                                      
                   The NSF Faculty Award for Women recognizes the high quality               
              of the awardee's record in teaching and scholarship as well as                 
              potential for continued significant contributions to scientific                
              research, the academic profession, and the education of future                 
              scientists.  Particularly noteworthy achievements are Dr.                      
              Cizewski's teaching achievements, her encouragement of graduate                
              research, and her own research in nuclear physics.
