Abstract    :
                   This work continues the nuclear theory program of Carl                    
              Shakin and Louis Celenza at CUNY Brooklyn.  A broad range of                   
              problems will be addressed concerning nuclear structure and                    
              reactions at mean-field and relativistic energy scales and                     
              problems related to the underlying quark substructure of                       
              nuclei.  The emphasis is on relativistic theoretical                           
              frameworks.  Some selected topics are the description of                       
              nuclear matter using light front dynamics, the general theory                  
              of electromagnetic response functions, a comparison of instant                 
              and light-front dynamics and light-front structure functions                   
              of nucleons.
