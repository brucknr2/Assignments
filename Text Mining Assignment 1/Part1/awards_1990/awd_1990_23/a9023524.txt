Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Research is proposed in the development of novel numerical                     
              algorithms for the solution of partial differential equations                  
              arising in computational fluid dynamics.  Issues of interest                   
              include the use of novel adaptive grid techniques for                          
              compressible and incompressible flows in two and three                         
              dimensions, the inclusion of chemistry terms for combustion and                
              hypersonic flow and the suitability of SIMD architectures, such                
              as the Connection Machine, for any type of adaptive grid                       
              algorithms.  Computer science techniques will be combined with                 
              the mathematics of numerical computations in carrying out the                  
              proposed research.
