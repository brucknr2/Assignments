Abstract    :
                   A research program will be carried out at the Brookhaven                  
              National Lab (BNL) AGS facility and at Vassar College related                  
              to hypernuclear physics, specifically, experiments aimed at a                  
              search for rare, strangeness -2 dibaryons and for sigma                        
              hypernuclei in which sigma baryons are bound in nuclei.  The                   
              dibaryon search is motivated by serious quark bag model                        
              predictions.  The sigma hypernuclear search offers the                         
              possibility of new information regarding the force between                     
              sigma baryons and normal nuclear matter, and ultimately how                    
              the introduction of strange quarks into the nucleon modifies                   
              the strong force.  Undergraduate students will be integrated                   
              into this research program.  The research will be carried out                  
              in collaboration with a larger group including staff at BNL.
