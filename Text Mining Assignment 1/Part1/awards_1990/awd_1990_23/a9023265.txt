Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will permit the completion of an important new                      
              astronomical instrument, a spectropolarimeter for the  palomar five            
              meter telescope.  This instrument will be used to study the nuclei             
              of active galaxies by a group that has led the way in the study of             
              apparant superluminal motion in these objects.
