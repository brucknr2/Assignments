Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This study investigates whether work conditions influence emp-                 
              loyer continuity among women following childbirth.  Certain work               
              conditions are hypothesized to improve continuity rates.  Inter-               
              views with 300 expectant women in northern Indiana ask their                   
              perceptions of employment conditions, job factors in their plans               
              for work after the birth, and effects of organizational charac-                
              teristics on the provision and use of family benefits for emp-                 
              loyed women.  Results will document obstacles to work following                
              childbirth among women who originally planned to return, and will              
              tell what employment practices maximize retention and job satis-               
              faction among mothers.
