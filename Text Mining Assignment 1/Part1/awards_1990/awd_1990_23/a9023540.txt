Abstract    :
              The objective of the research is to use an alternating                         
              current (instead of direct current) to provide the needed                      
              electrical field in the application of electrokinetics for                     
              contaminant management in clays. The study will emphasize                      
              the verification of theoretical concepts by testing                            
              remolded soil samples as well as undisturbed soil specimens                    
              in a triaxial cell that has been modified to permit the                        
              application of an alternating electric field.
