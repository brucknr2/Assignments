Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This program will attempt, purportedly for the first time, to                  
              fabricate thin film heterostructures of electroactive polymers                 
              in which the structure and architecture of the films are                       
              manipulated at the molecular level.  The new materials formed                  
              from these complex molecular assemblies will be studied for                    
              the determination of their optical properties, electrical                      
              properties, which will provide new insights into the                           
              fundamental behavior of electroactive polymers and reveal new                  
              opportunities for thin film devices and microelectronic                        
              sensors.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              The overall objectives of the research is to fabricate,                        
              characterize, and evaluate novel, highly ordered, molecular                    
              assemblies of electroactive polymers.  Specifically, .e                        
              monolayer forming systems based on electroactive polymers will                 
              be developed and utilized in conjunction with previously                       
              developed electroactive monolayers to fabricate complex                        
              heterostructures comprised of functionally distinct layers                     
              arranged at the molecular level to achieve specific                            
              electrical, optical, or chemical response.  Particular                         
              attention will be paid to monolayer forming systems that                       
              provide the highest level of order and orientation of the                      
              electroactive polymer component and a high degree of                           
              processing flexibility.
