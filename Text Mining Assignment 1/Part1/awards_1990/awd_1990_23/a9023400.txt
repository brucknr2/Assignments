Abstract    :
              This project will combine spin-polarized tunneling methods with                
              some of the techniques of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) in an            
              ultra high vacuum environment.  The techniques will be applied to              
              probe the surface magnetism of superconducting and magnetic                    
              materials.  The research will include low temperature studies of               
              spin-orbit and magnetic scattering in superconductors, magnetic                
              impurities in normal metals, and tunneling measurements with                   
              oriented single-crystal ferromagnets.  Part of the project will                
              involve continued development of superconducting and ferromagnetic             
              tips crucial to operation of STM and spin polarized tunneling SSTM             
              apparatus.  Ferromagnetic to ferromagnetic tunneling measurements              
              will be made at temperatures up to 300 K with various materials and            
              modulation techniques.  The STM techniques will initially be used              
              to position the tunneling tip at a proper site within tunneling                
              distance.  Later the limits of spatial resolution will be                      
              investigated in the study of individual impurities or                          
              antiferromagnets.  These results will be compared with theory.  It             
              is expected that this study will give information leading to                   
              eventual design of a spin-sensitive tunneling microscope with close            
              to atomic resolution.
