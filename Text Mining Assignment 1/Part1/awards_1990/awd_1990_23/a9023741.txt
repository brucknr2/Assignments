Abstract    :
                   A group of three senior scientists, research associates                   
              and students will continue their research in elementary                        
              particle physics.  Three activities will be pursued during the                 
              grant period.  1.  A comprehensive program of precision studies                
              of the spectroscopy of the system consisting of a b-quark with                 
              its anti-particle will come to conclusion.  These studies at                   
              the Cornell Electron Storage Ring with the Columbia University                 
              - Stony Brook detector (CUSB), began in 1977 and emphasized                    
              photon detection with a high resolution spectrometer.  2.                      
              Participation in the construction and research program of the                  
              D0 detector at Fermilab will continue.  The detector will have                 
              a major commissioning run in the summer of 1991 followed by a                  
              long data taking run two to three years later.  The group has                  
              been involved with design of the electronics for the detector                  
              and its upgrades and will soon also be heavily involved in the                 
              data analysis.  3.  A new activity will begin with the Phi-                    
              factory planned to be built at Frascati in Italy.
