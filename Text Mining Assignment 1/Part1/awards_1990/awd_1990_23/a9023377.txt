Abstract    :
              This grant in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry program of                  
              the Chemistry Division will support faculty from Liberal Arts                  
              colleges in the southeastern United States who wish to enhance                 
              their teaching by participating in research.  Faculty                          
              interested in analytical chemistry will congregate at Tennessee                
              at times convenient to them each summer, and also participate                  
              during the school year at their home institutions as                           
              facilities, time, and interest permit.  Work at Oak Ridge                      
              National Laboratory may occur as appropriate.                                  
              By bringing faculty from many regional institutions with                       
              similar research interests to a single site, this Research                     
              Opportunity Award will enhance collaboration among schools,                    
              promote research, enhance the Research Experiences for                         
              Undergraduates program at Tennessee, and thus significantly                    
              improve the competance of existing scientists and the flow of                  
              new scientists into analytical and surface chemistry.
