Abstract    :
              The Skidaway Institute of Oceanographic will acquire a two-                    
              axis, fiber-optic laser doppler velocimeter (LDV) for the                      
              study of benthic boundary layers.  Studying the small-scale                    
              dynamics between seafloor sediments and the water just                         
              above requires a multi-dimensional approach.  Such studies                     
              involve laboratory and field measurement programs, and                         
              numerical modelling.  Recently developed LDVs offer a                          
              modern way to non-invasively measure mean velocities,                          
              turbulence intensity in both along-stream and vertical                         
              directions, and turbulent shear stress.  The LDV flow                          
              measurement system will be integrated into a large flume                       
              research facility being constructed with institutional                         
              funds.  It will serve a number of investigators in the                         
              Southeastern U.S. working on multidisciplinary problems                        
              relating to sediment geochemistry, sediment transport, and                     
              benthic ecology.
