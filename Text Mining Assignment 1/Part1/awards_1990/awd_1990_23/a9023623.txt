Abstract    :
                   The PI plans to study the tropical convective systems and                 
              their impact on the forcing of tropospheric and mesospheric                    
              circulation patterns by utilizing satellite data bases in                      
              conjunction with data obtained from wind profiles.  She will                   
              also examine the relationships between satellite derived                       
              measurements of atmospheric water vapor and vertical wind                      
              profiles measured by the radars in the tropics in order to                     
              provide insight into the dynamics of vertical energy fluxes which              
              couple the energy from the source regions to other heights.  She               
              also plans to obtain the statistics of cloud composites                        
              associated with convection in order to force a model of an                     
              atmosphere on a rotating sphere to establish the mode structures               
              in the wind field that will be present in the troposphere,                     
              stratosphere, and mesosphere.  The model-generated mode                        
              structures will be compared with the radar observed mesospheric                
              structures of the diurnal tide, quasi two-day wave, and other                  
              longer period wave motions.  Additionally, the PI plans to gain                
              expertise in two other atmospheric radar probing techniques, the               
              MF/HF radar and the 1 GHz boundary layer radar.
