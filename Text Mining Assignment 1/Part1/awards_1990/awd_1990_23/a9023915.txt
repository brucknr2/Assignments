Abstract    :
              This research will investigate the micro-structure of various types            
              of non-woven geotextiles. Specifically 1) direct methods (water                
              vapor impregnation and image processing techniques) will be                    
              utilized to quantify the micro-structures of the geotextiles of                
              interest, in addition to the current practice of obtaining data                
              only from indirect methods (dry and hydrodynamic sieving methods);             
              2) a number of performance tests will be conducted on various types            
              of geotextiles and soils to evaluate the performance to determine              
              the suitability of the geotextiles to a particular soil-type under             
              simulated field conditions; 3) the micro-structure and the                     
              performance data received from step one and two respectively will,             
              in turn, set the stage for the development of a mathematical model             
              relating micro-structures of geotextiles and its hydraulic                     
              properties in field conditions; and 4) an attempt will be made to              
              develop an expert system for selection of geotextiles for filter               
              and drainage application.
