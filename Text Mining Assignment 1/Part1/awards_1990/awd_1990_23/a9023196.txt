Abstract    :
                   This project involves the study of nonlinear hyperbolic                   
              systems of partial differential equations from both analytical                 
              and numerical points of view, with emphasis on problems from                   
              Plasma Physics and the Vlasov-Maxwell system.  Particle Methods                
              for higher-dimensional systems will be studied, with the goal of               
              obtaining convergence as well as higher-order accuracy.                        
              Collisional effects (e.g. those from the LANDAU system) will also              
              be included.  Many of the presently-used numerical schemes have                
              little (if any) theoretical justification.  For those few that                 
              are well founded, the known accuracy is relatively poor.  Thus                 
              from a practical point of view, much improvement is possible.                  
              Moreover, at this time there are no rigorous studies (neither                  
              theoretical nor computational) of collisional effects.  These                  
              studies will have application in areas such as fusion energy.
