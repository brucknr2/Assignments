Abstract    :
              Thomborson         The theory underlying optimal adder design and global wire 
              routing is well understood, so the focus is on implementation  issues. 
              Experimental software is being developed to determine  optimal adders. 
              Attention is being paid to tradeoffs between the  smallest area, fastest, and
              least power adders.  The feasibility  of using large linear programs to solve
              the problem of routing  wires on chips and modules is being investigated. 
              Theoretical  work is on the problem of finding minimum length tree shaped 
              interconnections (Steiner trees) among a set of terminals on a  VLSI chip. 
              Rendering grey-scale images on a monochrome display  terminal or laser printer
              is being explored.  Algorithms,  amenable to speedup on parallel or pipelined
              computers, are  sought.
