Abstract    :
                   There is much interplay between the areas of algebraic                    
              geometry and the geometric aspects of several complex variables -              
              areas which have engendered a significant amount of current                    
              research activity and excitement.  Among the fundamental problems              
              on which important progress has been made are:  (a) applications of            
              Hodge theory to complex and algebraic geometry; (b) properties of              
              holomorphic and meromorphic mappings of complex manifolds; and (c)             
              theory of the classification of algebraic 3-folds.                             
                   This grant will help support a conference to be held at Johns             
              Hopkins University in April, 1991, which will focus on the above               
              mentioned areas.  This conference will provide an excellent chance             
              for U.S. mathematicians to interact with their Japanese counter-               
              parts, a number of whom are visiting Johns Hopkins under the                   
              auspices of the Japan-U.S. Mathematics Institute.
