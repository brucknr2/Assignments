Abstract    :
              This research project plans to investigate the microscopic                     
              characteristics of dopant-hydrogen complexes.  Hydrogen, as a                  
              ubiquitous impurity in semiconductors, forms complexes with a wide             
              variety of defect species, thereby modifying the electrical and                
              optical properties.  The research will involve a combination of                
              vibrational spectroscopy, uniaxial stress techniques, and theory to            
              address these complexes.  In addition to searching for new hydrogen-           
              related defect centers a number of centers that are already known              
              but not well understood will be studied.  The motion of the                    
              hydrogen within the defect complex will also be studied.                       
              Associated with the hydrogen motion are relaxations of the host                
              atoms.  The lightness of the hydrogen also suggests quantum                    
              mechanical effects may be important.
