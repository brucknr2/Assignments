Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This award provides support to Dr. Dawn Iacobucci under                   
              the National Science Foundation's Faculty Awards for Women                     
              Scientists and Engineers Program.  The objectives of this                      
              program are to recognize the nation's most outstanding and                     
              promising women scientists and engineers in academic careers                   
              in research and teaching, to retain them in academia, and to                   
              facilitate the further development of their careers.                           
                                                                                             
                   This award will allow the investigator to pursue her                      
              research spanning the areas of statistical modeling and the                    
              use of such models to social network applications in                           
              marketing.  She will extend her modeling work by applying it                   
              to comparisons between pairs of people or between groups.                      
              For example, she plans to develop a means of identifying a                     
              firm's competitors in the marketplace using data and models                    
              of social network ties between organizations.  She also plans                  
              to investigate the effects of differing amounts of                             
              information on the actions of an intermediary agent in a                       
              negotiation, such as a real estate agent assisting a home                      
              buyer and seller.  She will also investigate the use of                        
              computer simulations and human laboratory experiments in                       
              conjunction to better understand two-person interaction                        
              processes.
