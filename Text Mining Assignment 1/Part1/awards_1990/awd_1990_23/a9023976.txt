Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research examines phase transitions induced by surface                    
              segregation of solute in metal alloys.  An associated surface                  
              miscibility gap is determined by experiment and modeling and the               
              morphological features of the phase transition followed.  A model              
              of the transition is compared to experimental results.  The model              
              alloy system is copper-silver with selected alloy compositions.  A             
              second thrust is on the effects of surface segregation on the                  
              equilibrium form of alloy crystals and related surface energies.               
              This research is performed on lead-bismuth and lead-tin alloys.                
              This study of surfaces relates to a variety of physical phenomena              
              occurring at or near crystal surfaces that in part determines the              
              useful properies of such materials.  Therefore this research is                
              important to the continued advancement of materials.
