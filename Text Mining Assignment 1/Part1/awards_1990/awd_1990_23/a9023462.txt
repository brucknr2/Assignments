Abstract    :
              Between 1945 and 1961, West German chemical producers made the                 
              transition from primarily coal-based to predominately petroleum-               
              based feedstocks for manufacture of organic chemicals, thus                    
              following American leadership in petrochemical technology and                  
              ensuring their long-term competitiveness.  Dr. Stokes is examining             
              this significant change, combining approaches drawn from political             
              and economic history with those from history of technology.  This              
              study will contribute to broader issues including the political,               
              economic and social factors affecting technological choice;                    
              technological transfer in its political context, and the state's               
              role in shaping technological development.                                     
                                                                                             
              Under this grant, Dr. Stokes is completing research including                  
              travel to Germany to examine the archives of the BASF and Bayer                
              companies and Federal Archives in Koblenz.  This research promises             
              to produce a detailed examination of the emergence of the West                 
              German petrochemical industry.  Understanding how this German                  
              industry transformed itself from technological backwardness                    
              (compared to its British and American counterparts) to world                   
              leadership will shed light on the process and effective strategies             
              of technological change.  It will also help us to understand the               
              bases of West Germany's political, economic, and technological                 
              performance in the postwar world.
