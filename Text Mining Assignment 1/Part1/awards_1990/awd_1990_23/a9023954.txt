Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project surveys a representative national sample of 1500                  
              U.S. adults to get their ideas of justice regarding economic,                  
              political, and social issues.  Respondents will report their                   
              conceptions of both actual and ideal relationships between                     
              individuals' characteristics and their outcomes.  Data will                    
              permit the first comprehensive test of a formal theory of deter-               
              minants and consequences of felt justice and injustice.  The                   
              survey also will be administered in countries with governments                 
              and economic systems comparable to the U.S. (Great Britain,                    
              Germany, Netherlands, Japan, and Italy) and in Eastern Europe                  
              (Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, the U.S.S.R., and Yugoslavia).                     
              Future research will survey China.  This permits comparisons of                
              justice feelings in different types of social systems, and in                  
              countries undergoing rapid change.  Analyses will include com-                 
              parisons of individuals in different circumstances, and of                     
              differing ages and cultural backgrounds.  The outcome of this                  
              project will be a collaborative monograph based on the multi-                  
              national data.
