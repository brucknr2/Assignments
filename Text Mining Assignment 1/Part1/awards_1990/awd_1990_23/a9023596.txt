Abstract    :
              The research will investigate the corrosion resistance of coated               
              and uncoated reinforcement in concrete subjected to cracking and               
              cyclic loading and methods to repair such sections undergoing                  
              corrosion.  Past research has been conducted on reinforced concrete            
              blocks, generally uncracked and unloaded, subjected to temperature             
              variations and wet/dry cycles of exposure to concentrated chloride             
              solutions.  To more realistically simulate field conditions, it is             
              intended in the investigation to include cracked and cyclically                
              loaded reinforced concrete slabs.  Past research has indicated that            
              under such conditions it may be possible to wear and crack bar                 
              coatings at crack interfaces.
