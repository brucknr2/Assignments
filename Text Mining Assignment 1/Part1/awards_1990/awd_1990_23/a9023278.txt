Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This project investigates causes of women's under-represen-               
              tation in science.  Data from five large surveys are analyzed to               
              test hypotheses concerning effects of early socialization,                     
              mathematical achievement, family duties, discrimination, and                   
              other factors.  Results will provide a more comprehensive view                 
              than previously available of the pathways women and men take to                
              scientific careers, and the special obstacles which affect                     
              women's career choices.
