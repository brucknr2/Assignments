Abstract    :
              The College of Marine Studies at the University of Delaware                    
              will acquire oceanographic instrumentation to be placed in a                   
              pool of shared use equipment.  This equipment is made                          
              available to users of the institution's research vessel: the                   
              R/V CAPE HENLOPEN, a 115-foot vessel that is owned and                         
              operated by the University.  A significant portion of the                      
              ship's operating schedule during 1991 is in support of NSF-                    
              sponsored research projects.  The instrumentation will also                    
              increase the capabilities of the ship and of the institution                   
              to support research and engineering activities.  The                           
              instrumentation includes:                                                      
                                                                                             
              -Scintillation counter for measurements of radio-isotope                       
                tracers and other chemical parameters,                                       
              -portable fume hood for removing chemical fumes from the                       
                ship's chemical laboratory van.                                              
                                                                                             
              The equipment described above will increase the capability of                  
              the University to support NSF-sponsored research and                           
              engineering projects.
