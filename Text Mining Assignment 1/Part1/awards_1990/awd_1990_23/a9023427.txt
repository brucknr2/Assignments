Abstract    :
                   Professor Bourdon will investigate the iteration of                       
              holomorphic maps of the unit disk of the complex plane into                    
              itself.  The project concerns finding a linear fractional model                
              of the map in question.  The investigation will take place in the              
              framework of composition operators on a Hilbert space of analytic              
              functions.  A major component of the work will involve the use of              
              a computer to generate conjectures and then prove them                         
              analytically.  Part of the project will be done with the active                
              participation of undergraduates.                                               
                        Hilbert space operators are essentially infinite                     
              matrices of complex numbers.  These operators have applications                
              in every area of applied science as well as in pure mathematics.               
              Bourdon's research is an attempt to understand certain important               
              classes of such objects.
