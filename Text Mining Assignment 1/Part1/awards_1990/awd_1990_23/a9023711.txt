Abstract    :
              This is a three-year program in Theoretical                                    
              Modeling of Microelectromechanical Systems                                     
              combining the efforts of investigators from the                                
              Electrical Engineering and Civil Engineering                                   
              Department at Case Western Reserve University.                                 
              The program objectives are to carry out theoretical                            
              studies to gain a fundamental understanding of                                 
              electromechanical and (mechanical) interface                                   
              characteristics of microfabricated electromechanical                           
              devices and to produce models which can predict                                
              the electromechanical performance of these devices.                            
              A thorough understanding of these                                              
              electromechanical and interface properties as well                             
              as predictive theoretical models is necessary for                              
              successful design and fabrication of                                           
              microelectromechanical systems (MEMS).                                         
                                                                                             
              The research program is organized into two parts:                              
              (i) development of advanced computational                                      
              techniques for electromagnetic, (mechanical) stress,                           
              and coupled electromagnetic/stress fields analysis in                          
              microelectromechanical devices and (ii)                                        
              development of theoretical interface models for                                
              friction, lubrication, and wear in                                             
              microelectromechanical devices.  These two parts                               
              have a synergetic relation toward the objectives                               
              stated above.
