Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This Faculty Award for Women Scientists and Engineers is made to               
              Dr. Martha P. Haynes of the Department of Astronomy, Cornell                   
              University.  The NSF Faculty Award for Women Scientists and                    
              Engineers recognizes the high quality of the awardee's record in               
              teaching and scholarship as well as the potential for continued                
              significant contributions to scientific research, the academic                 
              profession, and the education of future scientists.                            
                                                                                             
              During the next five years, the research will focus on how galaxy              
              formation and evolution is affected the environment in which a                 
              galaxy lives, primarily through ground-based radio and optical                 
              observations.  Of particular interest is how the fundamental                   
              properties of galaxies (mass, luminosity, etc.) reflect                        
              conditions early in a galaxy's history rather than later                       
              modifications due to evolutionary processes.                                   
                                                                                             
              The grant will be used to enlarge the research group,                          
              particularly with the addition of a postdoctoral research                      
              associate and an additional graduate student, as there is much                 
              fertile research to be done to follow through on the efforts of                
              the last decade.  Towards the end of the five year grant period,               
              there will be early observations made with the upgraded Arecibo                
              Observatory radio antenna and with the new 100m Green Bank                     
              Telescope.  Experiments not previously possible will be                        
              attempted.
