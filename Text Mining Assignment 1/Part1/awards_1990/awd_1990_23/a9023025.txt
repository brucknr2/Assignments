Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Workshop on Analysis and Characterization of Marine Particles                  
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
              In the past 20 years, there has been an increasing amount of                   
              interest in suspended particulates in seawater.  There is,                     
              however, concern that the analytical and sampling variability                  
              associated with the methods be sufficiently within control that                
              the important temporal and spatial variability of particles and                
              fluxes may be discerned.  At this time there is a considerable                 
              diversity of approaches and techniques being used by the                       
              community of active researchers in this field and there is no                  
              single source which provides a review and catalogue of existing                
              methods for the characterization of marine particles.  In order                
              to remedy this workshop on sampling and chemical analysis of                   
              marine particles will bring together leading researchers in the                
              field of marine particle analysis.  The object of this meeting                 
              will be to produce a monograph which will be a comprehensive                   
              overview of the present practices, provide an effective teaching               
              resource for graduate level oceanography courses and be a                      
              reference for experienced researchers.
