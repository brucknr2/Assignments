Abstract    :
              The purpose of this research is to analyze decision-making by                  
              high level plant managers and economic administrators and                      
              bureaucrats in the Soviet Union.  Three sources of information                 
              will be utilized for this analysis-- a structured survey of 582                
              high-level government officials responsible for economic matters,              
              120 in-depth interviews with high level administrators, and a                  
              survey of 1500 Soviet enterprise managers.  The investigator will              
              use this survey data to study the resource allocation practices                
              of the Soviet economic bureaucracy, bureaucratic procedures, and               
              changes in these practices wrought by Soviet economic reform.                  
              This research is extremely important for the development of                    
              empirical knowledge about the Soviet economy.  Evidence of high                
              level Soviet managerial perceptions of their role in the Soviet                
              economic system and the functioning of that system will provide a              
              basis for evaluating existing theories and models.  Moreover,                  
              evidence of their perceptions of the changes under Perestroika                 
              will add to the empirical base for the analysis of Perestroika.
