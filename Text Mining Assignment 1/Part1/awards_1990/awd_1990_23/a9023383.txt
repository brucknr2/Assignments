Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project supports a cultural anthropologist at the University              
              of South Florida in an analysis of the network structure of                    
              public and private social service agencies in the Tampa Bay area.              
              Using network algorithms to analyze the function and shape of the              
              interactions between these agencies, the project will describe                 
              and analyze the hierarchy of interactions between about 500                    
              agencies.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              This research is important because communities in the developed                
              world have multiple social service agencies interacting with each              
              other, various levels of government, social institutions such as               
              schools, and the general public.  Understanding how these                      
              interactions are structured in a hierarchical manner will advance              
              the abilities of decision makers to allocate resources                         
              efficiently.
