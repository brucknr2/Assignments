Abstract    :
              This research is carried out in                                                
              recognition of the fact that                                                   
              numerical simulations have increased                                           
              in importance in almost all areas of                                           
              engineering, although they may often                                           
              be too expensive for routine                                                   
              applications in many areas of                                                  
              engineering and applied science.                                               
              Recently, a new generation of

              issues of accuracy and efficiency of                                           
              numerical simulations.  Based on the                                           
              initial success of adaptive                                                    
              algorithms in computational

              that those schemes be extended to                                              
              applications in other areas of                                                 
              engineering.  One such area is

              information is essential in
