Abstract    :
                   By channeling the energy flux from the energy-containing                  
              motion below the photosphere to the solar atmosphere, magnetic                 
              fields play an important role in the energetics of the                         
              chromosphere and of the corona.  The mechanical energy which must              
              be supplied at the higher altitudes may have its origin in quasi-              
              steady magnetic fields relaxing themselves via microflares,                    
              and/or in waves propogating in the magnetized plasma.  Most of                 
              the magnetic flux emerges from the sun in high intensity flux                  
              tubes.  Near the surface of the sun, the flux tubes expand as                  
              they reach the solar atmosphere.  Previous studies have shown                  
              that this expansion strongly affects the equilibrium structure                 
              and the observed emission measure.  The propagation of                         
              magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves is also affected by the                        
              expansion.  A numerical study of these processes in                            
              multidimensional geometry will bring a better understanding of                 
              the coupling between the photosphere and solar atmosphere, such                
              as e.g., estimates of wave energy output.  It is planned to use a              
              previously developed magnetohydrodynamic numerical code with                   
              curvilinear coordinates adaptable to the geometrical complexity                
              of the magnetic field and to the strong density stratification.                
              The focus of this study is on the effects of magnetic structures               
              on MHD wave excitation and transfer in the solar atmosphere.                   
              These multidimensional results will be compared with the previous              
              one-dimensional estimates as well as with the mechanical energy                
              requirements given by transport models.
