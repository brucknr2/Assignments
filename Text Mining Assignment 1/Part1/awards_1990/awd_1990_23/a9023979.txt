Abstract    :
              The focus of this research system level design tools, and it is                
              being conducted within the ADAM project at USC.  Tools include a               
              partitioner, a simulator-verifier, a multi-processor synthesizer,              
              software for making hardware-software tradeoffs, memory hierarchy              
              design tools, bus selection software, and a system-wide scheduler.             
              The first research task is to make available to the CAD design                 
              community recently developed system level tools. To do this, user              
              interfaces are being constructed, and the tools integrated into a              
              CAD framework.  Second is to explore new research topics: a high               
              level synthesis tool to configure neural chips from specified                  
              behavior, use of artificial intelligence techniques to meet                    
              conflicting design goals and constraints, and a study of the                   
              mechanical-electrical interface.  Third, formal models of the                  
              system design process are being explored.                                      
                     This grant is made under the Faculty Awards for Women                   
              Scientists and Engineers Program.
