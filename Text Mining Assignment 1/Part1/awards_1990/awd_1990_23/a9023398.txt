Abstract    :
              With this grant in the Theoretical and Computational Program of                
              the Chemistry Division, Professor Tannor will study a wide                     
              variety of three-dimensional photodissociation and reactive                    
              scattering processes using converged quantum mechanical time                   
              dependent wavepacket methods. The results of the computations                  
              will aid experimentalists in interpreting the mechanisms of                    
              exceedingly rapid chemical reactions. Experimental data for                    
              these fast reactions is just now emerging from Zewail's group                  
              at the California Institute of Technology.                                     
                                                                                             
              Experimental absorption, emission and final product                            
              measurements will be modeled. The processes to be studied                      
              include ozone photodissociation, IHI(-) photodissociation, H3+                 
              predissociation, H+H2 reactive scattering and polyene                          
              spectroscopy and photochemistry. The results will be visualized                
              by viewing the three-dimensional wavepacket trajectories as a                  
              function of time, using 3-D computer graphics. A novel and                     
              efficient set of computational techniques will be employed,                    
              involving the synthesis of FFT and DVR methods, and propagation                
              in the Interaction Representation.
