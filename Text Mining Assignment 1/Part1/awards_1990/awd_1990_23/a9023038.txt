Abstract    :
                   This award will partially support the Particles and Fields                
              Conference to be held in Vancouver, Canada; August 18-22, 1991.                
              This is a meeting of the Division of Particles and Fields of the               
              American Physical Society, which will be held jointly with the                 
              Division of Particle Physics of the Canadian Association of                    
              Physicists on the campus of the University of British Columbia.                
              Planary and parallel sessions will cover most of the currently                 
              active high energy physics topics and will provide a broad                     
              overview of what is being done now at the various accelerator                  
              centers of the World.  The award is for the partial support of                 
              US students and post-doctorals, who would otherwise have                       
              difficulty obtaining support.
