Abstract    :
              This is a research project aimed at developing an                              
              improved understanding of the behavior of                                      
              materials and structural elements (beams, plates,                              
              membranes) employed in the manufacture of                                      
              micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS), on the                                
              basis of the microstructure exhibited by the                                   
              materials, with the goal of assessing the                                      
              performance reliability of such systems.  Effective                            
              (overall) physical properties, primarily elasticity and                        
              strength, and the associated structural response will                          
              be evaluated with the recognition that there are a                             
              number of microstructural effects that are                                     
              important at the length scales associated with                                 
              MEMS but which are unimportant at larger length                                
              scales. These include the typical linear dimension of                          
              a crystallite within the material being on the same                            
              order of magnitude as the thickness of the film,                               
              substantial through-thickness variations in grain size                         
              and shape, the presence of considerable alignment                              
              of the grains (texture) leading to anisotropy of                               
              response, and large levels of residual stress arising                          
              form the processes used to create may MEMS.                                    
              Such effects may preclude direct application of                                
              classical theories for structural elements, thus                               
              necessitating the development of new theories.                                 
              Furthermore, the variability inherent in the                                   
              microstructure, which depends strongly on the                                  
              process conditions, requires a probabilistic                                   
              description of the material behavior and structural                            
              response evaluation aimed at assessing the                                     
              performance reliability of MEMS.  To this end, this                            
              research will address:  (1) mathematical modeling                              
              of material strength and effective properties, (2)                             
              influence of microstructure on the structural                                  
              response of MEMS, and (3) reliability analysis of                              
              MEMS using stochastic finite-element methods.
