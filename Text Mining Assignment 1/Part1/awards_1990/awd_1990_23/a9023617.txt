Abstract    :
              Methanogens are fastidious anaerobic archaebacteria whose                      
              metabolism centers around the reduction of CO2 to CH4.  Their                  
              environments are often extreme and they have evolved to handle                 
              these stresses differently from other bacteria.  One critical                  
              aspect of methanogen metabolism which has received little is                   
              osmoregulation.  Dr. Roberts plans to explore molecular                        
              biological approaches to study osmoregulation in methanogens at                
              the DNA/mRNA as well as protein levels.                                        
                                                                                             
              This proposal fulfills the FAW objectives which are 1) to                      
              recognize outstanding and promising women scientists and                       
              engineers in academic careers of research and teaching and 2) to               
              facilitate the further development of their careers.
