Abstract    :
                   This Faculty Award for Women Scientists and Engineers is                  
              made to Dr. Ruth J. Williams of the Department of Mathematics,                 
              University of California, San Diego.  Dr. Williams will continue               
              working in her research interest in probability, specifically on               
              stochastic processes.  Her primary focus to date has been on                   
              multidimensional diffusions and their applications in physical,                
              biological and social sciences, as well as in engineering.  She                
              plans to investigate stochastic integral equations and nonlinear               
              PDE's and their connection with stochastic processes.                          
                   The NSF Faculty Award for Women recognizes the high quality               
              of the awardee's record in teaching and scholarship as well as                 
              potential for continued significant contributions to scientific                
              research, the academic profession, and the education of future                 
              scientists.  Dr. Williams will continue her work on stochastic                 
              processes, an area of probability theory.  Particulary noteworthy              
              is her appointment to an Associate Editorship to a leading                     
              journal of probability.
