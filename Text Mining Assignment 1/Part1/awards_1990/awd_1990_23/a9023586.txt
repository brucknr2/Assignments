Abstract    :
                   This project continues theoretical studies incorporating                  
              relativistic effects in nucleon physics.  The two main programs                
              are relativistic nuclear hamiltonian dynamics (Keister) and the                
              quark structure of hadrons.  Specific topics to be studied                     
              include nucleon Compton scattering and a light-cone model for                  
              inclusive nuclear reactions.
