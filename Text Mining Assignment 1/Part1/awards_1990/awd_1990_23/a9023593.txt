Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
               WESTNET is one of approximately 20 mid-level networks which                  
              connect to the NSFNET backbone.  Through the mid-levels, the                   
              NSFNET links over a thousand university and college campuses,                  
              business and industrial research laboratories, and governmental                
              research centers across the nation and around the world.  Using                
              NSFNET, educators and researchers access library resources,                    
              supercomputing centers, satellite data, medical imaging,                       
              scientific instruments, video applications, national data bases,               
              and colleagues worldwide.  The states covered by WESTNET are                   
              Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming, and the lower                 
              part of Idaho.                                                                 
                                                                                             
                This award funds upgrading the speed of the WESTNET                          
              communication line into each state from 56,000 bits per second to              
              1.544 million bits per second.  It also provides for circuit and               
              hardware redundancy to minimize any downtime, and increased hours              
              and services for the Network Operations Center.***
