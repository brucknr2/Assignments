Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal is for career advancement under the Research                     
              Opportunities for Women program of the National Science Foundation.            
              The principal investigator intends to enhance her career in                    
              research by collaborating with investigators at the University of              
              California, Berkeley in the study of the interfaces in                         
              aggregate/cement and steel/cement systems. Particular emphasis will            
              be placed on the relationship between interface morphology and the             
              corrosion initiation of steel in concrete. Specimens of concrete               
              with embedded steel rebars will be subjected to controlled                     
              environment, such as sodium salt solution, for various periods of              
              time. During the test the open-circuit potential, which has been               
              shown to be a good indicator of corrosion initiation, will be                  
              monitored. Periodically, the tests will be interrupted and the                 
              hydration phases and pore distribution at the interface will be                
              analyzed using back-scattering electron imaging coupled with an                
              image analyzer. The effects of admixtures will be studied by                   
              preparing concrete specimens with 10 weight percent replacement of             
              cement by silica fume. The research is intended to contribute to               
              the knowledge and understanding of concrete microstructural                    
              properties and their impact on the corrosion process of steel in               
              concrete.
