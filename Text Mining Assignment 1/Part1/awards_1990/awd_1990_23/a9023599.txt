Abstract    :
              This award provides support to Dr. Christina Romer under the                   
              National Science Foundation's Faculty Awards for Women Scientists              
              and Engineers Program.  The objectives of this program are to                  
              recognize the nation's most outstanding and promising women                    
              scientists and engineers in academic careers in research and                   
              teaching, to retain them in academia, and to facilitate the                    
              further development of their careers.                                          
                                                                                             
              This award will allow the investigator to pursue her research                  
              interests which focuses on the nature and causes of business                   
              cycles in the period before World War II, in the hopes of                      
              learning more about how the modern economy operates and about                  
              what can be done to prevent or mitigate business cycles in the                 
              future.  Three projects will be undertaken.  The first will                    
              analyze the role of macroeconomic policy stabilization of real                 
              output during the Great Depression.  The second will involve                   
              examining whether monetary and fiscal policies in the post war                 
              era have tended to in general to counteract or exacerbate                      
              movements in real output.  The third project will extend the PI's              
              previous work on historical macroeconomic data.  Her previous                  
              work has shown that since the conventional series is seriously                 
              flawed, it is important to look for new and better sources of                  
              prewar data.
