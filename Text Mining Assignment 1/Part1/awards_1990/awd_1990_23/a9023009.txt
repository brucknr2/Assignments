Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The objective of this proposal is the production of cie                   
              crystals by the propellers of aircraft when operated in supercooled            
              clouds.  These crystals comprise an undesirable contamination when             
              research aircraft attempt to measure the ice structure of natural              
              clouds.  Reduced pressure at the propeller tip is thought to                   
              initiate artificial nucleation; this and other candidate processes             
              will be investigated using the King Air aircraft.
