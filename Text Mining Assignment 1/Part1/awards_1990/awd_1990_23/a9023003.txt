Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project involves a comparative study of social and economic               
              factors affecting food production in four Micronesian societies.               
              Cultural anthropologists will study interactions among food                    
              production, consumption, and exchange within households in two                 
              female farming societies (Yap and Palau) and two male farming                  
              societies (Kosrae and Marshall Islands).  Communities within each              
              of the four societies vary with respect to level of food                       
              production, economic and political articulation with the world                 
              system, the importance of cash, and the degree of urbanization.                
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
              Data will include in-depth interviews as well as community                     
              surveys of social and economic behavior.  Case history materials               
              on household activities will be collected from a sample of                     
              households.  Formal analyses of the relations between attitudes,               
              goals, and economic behavior will be done.  This research is                   
              important because adequate food production in local communities                
              is a cause of concern in much of the world, and a comparative                  
              study like this one will advance our understanding of the social               
              and cultural causes  of variations in food production.
