Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              The P.I.'s propose to study spatial and temporal variations in                 
              the distributions and particulate fluxes of a suite of                         
              naturally occurring radioactive nuclides as part of the Joint                  
              Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS) in the equatorial Pacific.  The                
              radionuclides to be measured serve as ocean tracers that yield                 
              fundamental information about the rates of biogeochemical                      
              processes that govern the production and fate of biogenic                      
              particles in the oceanic water column.  The study is designed                  
              to test the hypothesis that the uptake and release of soluble                  
              chemical species by particulate matter, and the formation and                  
              destruction of particle aggregates in the oceanic water column                 
              occur at rates that vary both spatially and temporally in                      
              response to variations in the rate of plankton production at                   
              the sea surface and the flux of organic matter leaving the                     
              surface layer.  The data will be interpreted within the context                
              of biological rate measurements and other data to be collected                 
              within JGOFS and will be used to test biogeochemical models.
