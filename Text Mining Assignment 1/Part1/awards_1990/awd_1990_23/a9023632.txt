Abstract    :
              This Faculty Award for Women Scientists and Engineers is made                  
              to Dr. Hanna Reisler of the Department of Chemistry, University                
              of Southern California.  Reisler will continue investigations                  
              in the area of chemical dynamics.  Studies will emphasize                      
              photodissociation dynamics, mechanisms of bimolecular                          
              reactions, and collision-induced dissociation in the gas phase                 
              and on surfaces.

              The NSF Faculty Award for Women recognizes the high quality of                 
              the awardee's record in teaching and scholarship as well as                    
              potential for continued significant contributions to scientific                
              research, the academic profession, and the education of future                 
              scientists.  Particularly noteworthy achievements are Reisler's                
              work on the fundamental dynamics of chemical bond breaking and                 
              her involvement in the training of graduate students.
