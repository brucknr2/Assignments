Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary objective of this US-Poland research project                       
              between Dr. Richard Aron of Kent State University and                          
              Dr. Alexander Pelczynski of the Institute opf Mathematics,                     
              Polish Academy of Sciences, is to undertake joint                              
              research on both function, matrix and operator algebras,                       
              and polynomials on finite and infinite dimensional                             
              spaces.  The researchers intend to concentrate on Banach                       
              space concepts and questions in classical analysis,                            
              particularly questions about inequalities.  The groups                         
              involved are amongst the leaders in this field and have                        
              cooperated in the past.  Continued collaboration should                        
              yield increased research activity and output in the                            
              three general areas of function algebras, operator                             
              ideals and polynomials.  Any progress in this area would                       
              represent a significant contribution to mathematical                           
              research and enable contacts between the US and Poland                         
              to be substantially strengthened.                                              
                                                                                             
              This project in mathematical research fulfills the                             
              program objectives of advancing scientific knowledge by                        
              enabling leading experts in the United States and                              
              Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool                       
              research resources in areas of strong mutual interest                          
              and competence.
