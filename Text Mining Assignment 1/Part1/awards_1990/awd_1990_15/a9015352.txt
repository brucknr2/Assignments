Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a travel request to attend the 5th World Filtration                    
              Congress in Nice, France.  Originated and organized in Paris                   
              by the French Filtration Society in 1974, the First Congress                   
              was a success in identifying the processing and technology                     
              problems of that period associated with filtration.  Since                     
              then three other Congresses have been held, in London in 1979,                 
              in Dowington, PA (USA), in 1982, and in Ostend (Belgium), in                   
              1986.  The major theme of the 5th Congress is separation by                    
              filtration, giving due attention to the increasingly                           
              significant role of membranes.  Emphasis is on the adaptation                  
              of processes to market requirements, energy savings, and                       
              quality of life.
