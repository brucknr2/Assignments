Abstract    :
              The objective of the proposal is to identify, assess and prioritize            
              the national research needs for the civil engineering profession.              
              The conference will be structured and managed to go beyond the                 
              development of a long list of research ideas.  The emphasis will               
              be to select high priority problems, and to develop a prospectus               
              for problem solution to each of them.                                          
                                                                                             
              The Forum will be attended by consultants, developers, suppliers,              
              builders/constructors, specialty contractors, associations,                    
              researchers academics, and government agencies.
