Abstract    :
              The Department of Mathematics at the University of Michigan will               
              receive half-time support over a two-year period for a systems                 
              administrator for a network of computer workstations (Sun's,                   
              SPARC's, Mac's, PC's tied (via ethernet) to Servers) increasingly              
              used by members of the department in their research programs.                  
              Some of the research areas that will exploit the computational                 
              environment are:
