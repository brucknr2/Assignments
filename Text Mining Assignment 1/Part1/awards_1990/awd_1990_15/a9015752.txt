Abstract    :
              A new approach to implementing an                                              
              optical crossbar using acoustoopics                                            
              is proposed.  This novel device                                                
              configuration can permute an array                                             
              of single mode fiber inputs to                                                 
              outputs without suffering from fan-                                            
              in and fan-out loss, which plague                                              
              other approaches.  The                                                         
              reconfiguration time of the                                                    
              switching network can easily be sub                                            
              microsecond, and the addressing                                                
              complexity is minimal.  This fiber optic                                       
              switching system avoids optical to                                             
              electronic conversion and can                                                  
              transmit ultra high bandwidth                                                  
              signals.  The device concepts will                                             
              be verified using phased array bulk                                            
              acoustooptic devices.  Then, a                                                 
              compact integrated optics module                                               
              will be fabricated and optimized                                               
              using surface acoustic wave based                                              
              guided wave acoustooptic devices,                                              
              and the SAW modules will be inserted                                           
              into digital and video switching                                               
              system testbed demonstrations.                                                 
              These SAW modules can be combined                                              
              into larger networks, and photonic                                             
              switching architectures that take                                              
              advantage of this unique device                                                
              configuration will be investigated.
