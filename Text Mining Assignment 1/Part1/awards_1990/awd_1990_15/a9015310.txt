Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The goal of this project is to enhance molecular modeling of                   
              protein-DNA interactions and to develop an improved method for                 
              refining X-ray crystallographic data.  The improvements proposed               
              here will be incorporated into the AMBER set of molecular                      
              programs.
