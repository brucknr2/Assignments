Abstract    :
              This research is funded under the Special Initiative on Coordination           
              theory and Collaboration Technology.  This is one of eleven winners            
              under that competition.                                                        
              Traditional support for coordinating the activities of collaborative           
              software engineers consists mainly of version control and mail                 
              systems and does not meet the requirements of many software                    
              engineering tasks such as interactive group design and debugging.              
              In this project the researchers investigate flexible coordination of           
              the activities of cooperating software engineers.  In particular,              
              they develop an approach allowing: (1) a range of concurrency                  
              control mechanisms including serial transaction, concurrent                    
              serializable transactions, concurrent non-serializable transactions            
              allowing other transactions to access various types of partial                 
              results, and not control; (2) alerters automatically informing users           
              of events in which they are interested; (3) dynamic variable-grained           
              locking, and (4) live sound integrated with the concurrency control            
              mechanism.  In the development of the approach, the researchers use            
              results from the work done in shared windows, long transactions,               
              distributed interactive systems, and other systems.  The researchers           
              also study how a particular scheme can be automatically chosen by              
              the system based on a minimum performance level requested by the               
              user.  Several prototype applications will be developed to                     
              demonstrate the novel aspects of this research.
