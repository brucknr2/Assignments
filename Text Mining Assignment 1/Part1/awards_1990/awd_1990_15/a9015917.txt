Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Chairman of the Technical Committee for Ocean Processes and                
              Climate (TC/OPC) of the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission             
              (IOC) will be supported to advance the work of the Technical                   
              Committee, especially during intersessional periods.  A particular             
              focus of the Committee's work will be development of scientifc                 
              plans for a long-term large-scale ocean observing system in support            
              of ocean climate and related research.  The Chairman will provide              
              direction for the IOC Secretariat to staff the Committee and its               
              work; prepare and distribute Committee documentation; arrange for              
              program development workshops, etc.  The Chairman will assure                  
              effective interaction with other IOC bodies which support ocean                
              climate research and will represent IOC ocean climate and related              
              interests with other intergovernmental organizations involved in               
              activities in these areas, such as the World Meteorological                    
              Organization, the United Nations Environment Programme, etc.
