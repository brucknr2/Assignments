Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports a two week intensive training session at the               
              Pittsburgh Supercomputer Center (PSC) for twenty two students.  The            
              participants will be exposed to multi-processing, numerical                    
              methods, data communications, graphics as well as the standard                 
              elements of supercomputing.  Vectorization will be discussed and               
              students will be introduced to the FORGE Automatic Code                        
              vectorization package.  students will become familiar with                     
              performance monitoring techniques, visualization techniques and                
              multi-tasking with an introduction to parallel theory.  The                    
              students will be divided into three groups with each group                     
              receiving a project assignment.  First hand experience with                    
              distributed-task programming will also be part of the training                 
              institute.  Each group will be given the opportunity to produce an             
              animation sequence on videotape of their project results.  Faculty             
              will come from PSC, Carnegie-Mellon University, University of                  
              Pittsburgh, Thinking Machines Corporation and Pacific Sierra                   
              Research.  the supercomputer in use is the CRAY Y-MP/832.
