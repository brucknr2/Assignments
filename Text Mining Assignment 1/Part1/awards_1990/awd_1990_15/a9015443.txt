Abstract    :
              This research is funded under the Special Initiative on Coordination           
              Theory and Collaboration Technology.  This is one of eleven winners            
              under that competition.                                                        
                                                                                             
              The central focus of this research is experimental observation of              
              groups doing real collaborative work and using systems and                     
              communications media explicitly designed to aid in their tasks.                
              Expected results are to expand understanding of how people                     
              collaborate and how to design systems that augment collaborative               
              activities.  To this end the project has five interdependent                   
              components: 1) a theoretical foundation for observing and                      
              understanding the social and cognitive aspects of group                        
              collaborations; 2) tools for rapid prototyping and reconfiguration             
              of application environments for use by working groups, and multi-              
              media communications to support multi-person interactions; 3)                  
              protocol analysis tools to record and study how individuals and                
              groups interact through the networked computer environment; 4)                 
              application testbed systems (generic and domain specific) that can             
              be used by groups engaged in real work; and 5) group studies and               
              experiments to test systems, social and cognitive hypotheses.
