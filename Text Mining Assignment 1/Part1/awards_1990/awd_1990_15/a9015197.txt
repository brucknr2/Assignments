Abstract    :
              This project involves observations of the near infrared solar                  
              corona both prior to and during the total                                      
              solar eclipse of 11 July 1991, in an attempt to understand the                 
              relative contributions of electron                                             
              scattering, dust scattering and dust thermal emission near the Sun.            
              The observations will be carried                                               
              out in collaboration with scientists at the Institute for Astronomy            
              at the University of Hawaii.                                                   
              Instrumentation for this effort is currently being developed at the            
              Institute by team members, and                                                 
              features a system utilizing coronagraph techniques, designed to                
              allow measurements to be made                                                  
              outside the period of total eclipse.  Dr. MacQueen is an expert on             
              coronagraphs, and this information                                             
              is likely to lead to a better understanding of the interplanetary              
              medium.
