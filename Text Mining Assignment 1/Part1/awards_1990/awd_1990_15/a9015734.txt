Abstract    :
                   This research seeks to determine why some avian species live              
              in colonies.  This long-term project is unique in that it is                   
              designed to follow thousands of individual cliff swallows for the              
              duration of their lifetimes.  These birds nest in colonies of                  
              many different sizes.  Birds living in colonies which range in                 
              size from very small to extremely large will be monitored for                  
              several years and their lifespans calculated.  How many                        
              offspring each individual produces during its lifetime will be                 
              determined.  Differences in lifetime output of young will be                   
              related to the colony size each individual occupied.  This will                
              reveal what sorts of evolutionary costs and benefits individuals               
              can expect in different size colonies.  Many of the presumed                   
              costs and benefits of group  living are believed to be universal               
              for all social species, including humans.  This research will                  
              used a nonhuman model species to gain an understanding of the                  
              consequences of group living.
