              (ROA).  The principal investigator, Dr. Nora Sabelli, senior                   
              research scientist at the National center for Supercomputing                   
              Applications (NCSA) will be working with Prof. Linda McDonald,                 
              Asst. Prof. Physics Dept., North Park College.  Prof. McDonald is              
                                                                                             
              completing her Ph.D thesis research at NCSA on the calculation of
