Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Description:  This project is for participation by  U.S.                       
              scientists in an International Symposium/Workshop on                           
              Frontiers of Molecular Biological Research to be held in                       
              Lahore, Pakistan in September 1991.  The Pakistani                             
              organizer is Dr. S. Riazuddin, Director of the Center for                      
              Advanced Molecular Biology (CAMB) at the University of                         
              Panjab, Lahore.  Areas to be covered will include: repair                      
              enzymes, restriction enzymes, replication enzymes, plant                       
              microbe interaction, transgenic plant technology, and                          
              insecticidal proteins and other biological controls.  The                      
              meeting will be preceded by a two-week training course for                     
              twenty selected young university researchers who intend to                     
              pursue research careers in the field.  The purpose of the                      
              course will be to train researchers on advanced recombinant                    
              DNA techniques, on other methodologies and concepts that                       
              will form the basis for discussions in the                                     
              Symposium/Workshop.  Proceedings of papers presented and                       
              discussions will be printed and made available to the                          
              scientific communities in the two countries.                                   
                                                                                             
              Scope:  The field of molecular biology is becoming                             
              increasingly important in dealing with developing                              
              countries' problems such as production of food, medicines,                     
              and improving fuel sources and use.  U.S. and Pakistani                        
              scientists from the laboratories of Drs. Grossman and                          
              Riazuddin have been collaborating in joint research                            
              projects for over a decade.  This meeting allows this                          
              relationship to be expanded to include a larger number of                      
              Pakistani scientists and to help guide future local as well                    
              as joint research.
