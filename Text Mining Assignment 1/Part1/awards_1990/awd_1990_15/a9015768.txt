Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is to provide information, academic activities and                
              educational exposure to the marine environment to faculty and                  
              students from colleges and universities with enrollments                       
              dominated by minority groups.  It will be operated by nine                     
              members of the Southern Association of Marine Laboratories                     
              (SAML), and 36 Historically Minority Colleges and Universities                 
              (HMCUs).  Additional HMCUs will be encouraged to participate in                
              the project during its second year.  The three major components                
              are:  provision of support for minority students to participate                
              in courses and research at SAML institutions; provision of                     
              academic interactions between SAML members and HMCUs (seminars,                
              faculty visits, marine familiarization programs); and provision                
              of marine field trip experience to colleges and universities                   
              whose student bodies are dominated by minority students.  These                
              proposed activities will reach more than 350 students and 75                   
              faculty annually.
