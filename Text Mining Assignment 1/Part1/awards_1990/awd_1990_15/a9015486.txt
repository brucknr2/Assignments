Abstract    :
              In the proposed research program we plan to develop                            
              a series of new tunable solid-state laser materials                            
              based on tetravalent chromium (Cr4+) as laser-active                           
              ion in various low field dielectric crystal hosts and                          
              study their spectroscopic and laser properties.  These                         
              novel tunable solid state lasers are expected to                               
              operate in the technologically important near infrared                         
              spectral region between 1 - 2 um. Conventional                                 
              chromium-doped lasers are based on Cr3+ as an active                           
              ion.                                                                           
                                                                                             
              The spectroscopic and lasing properties of the various                         
              new tetravalent chromium-doped laser crystals will be                          
              investigated in order to obtain better understanding                           
              of lasing mechanisms in these tunable solid-state                              
              lasers.  One host crystal candidate with suitable                              
              tetrahedral sites where Cr4+ ion may substitute for a                          
              tetravalent cation will be selected and grown for                              
              spectroscopic and laser studies each year.  Most                               
              promising crystal hosts are various oxide crystals                             
              containing the SiO4 or GeO4 tetrahedra in its crystal                          
              lattice.  Measurements of the absorption spectra,                              
              excitation spectra, fluorescence spectra, and                                  
              fluorescence lifetime as a function of temperature                             
              and wavelength will be performed to identify optically                         
              active centers.  Gain and excited state absorption will                        
              be measured to determine possible loss mechanisms                              
              in tetravalent chromium-doped crystals.  Different                             
              modes of laser operation will be investigated.  The                            
              expected lasing (1-2 um) and forming (500-1000nm)                              
              wavelengths by second harmonic generation are                                  
              important for many possible applications in optical                            
              communication, coherent laser radar, night vision                              
              technology, remote sensing, range finding, counter                             
              measure, infrared semiconductor diagnosis, and                                 
              medical applications.
