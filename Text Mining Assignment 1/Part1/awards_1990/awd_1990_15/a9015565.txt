Abstract    :
              The proposed project is on the filtration of fibrous aerosols                  
              using nuclepore and fibrous filters.  Fibers tend to align                     
              with the flow and penetrate the filters.  The fiber                            
              orientation in filter will be determined using holographic and                 
              image processing techniques                                                    
              developed for ultrafine fibers with submicron diameters.  The                  
              results will be compared with filter efficiency measurements                   
              complemented with a theoretical model.                                         
                                                                                             
              The project will provide unique experimental results on the                    
              micromechanical aspects of a fiber motion in a filter and                      
              filter efficiency, with application in environmental control,
