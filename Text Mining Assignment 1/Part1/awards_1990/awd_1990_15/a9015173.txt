Abstract    :
                   Computer communication networks are becoming increasingly                 
              important for integration of administrative, engineering design,               
              and production processes in the large-scale manufacturing business.            
              The efficiency and flexibility of networks for computer-integrated             
              manufacturing (CIM) can be significantly improved by using optical             
              fibers as the transmission media.  Since the physical                          
              characteristics of optical fibers are significantly different from             
              those of coaxial cables, the topology and medium access mechanisms             
              in the existing CIM networking architectures need to be revised.               
                   The objective of this research is to conduct basic and applied            
              research in integrated office and factory communication networks.              
              The research will focus on the development and analysis of a high-             
              speed fiber-optic-based network protocol that will integrate real-             
              time distributed manufacturing processes with engineering design               
              and plant management databases.  Projects of national importance               
              like (1) Manufacturing Automation Protocol, (2) Technical                      
              and Office Protocols, and (3) Integrated Services Digital                      
              Network will directly benefit from this research.
