Abstract    :
                   Algorithmic complexity theory will be used to investagate                 
              1) the correspondnece principle for quantum systems whose                      
              classical counterparts are chaotic 2) the concept of minimum                   
              error in measurement theory and 3) the smooth boundary limit                   
              of the quantum motion of polygonal billiards.
