Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research in arithmetic algebraic                  
              geometry of Professor Jeremy Teitelbaum of the University of                   
              Illinois at Chicago. Dr. Teitelbaum will pursue his studies of                 
              the geometry and arithmetic of the p-adic upper half plane,                    
              guided by the Exceptional Zero Conjecture, which relates the                   
              values of certain functions, namely p-adic L-functions, to the                 
              analytic geometry of certain curves. In addition, he will                      
              continue his study of the computational complexity of algorithms               
              from algebraic geometry.                                                       
                   Arithmetic algebraic geometry is a subject that combines                  
              the techniques of algebraic geometry and number theory. In its                 
              original formulation, algebraic geometry treated figures that                  
              could be defined in the plane by the simplest equations, namely                
              polynomials. Number theory started with the whole numbers and such             
              questions as divisibility of one whole number by another. These two            
              subjects, seemingly so far apart, have in fact influenced each other           
              from the earliest times, but in the past quarter century the mutual            
              influence has increased greatly. The field of arithmetic algebraic             
              geometry now uses techniques from all of modern mathematics, and is            
              having corresponding influence beyond its own borders.
