Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Measurements of the auroral ionosphere using a digital                    
              research-ionosonde co-located with EISCAT near Tromso Norway                   
              provide the content and orientation of the proposed work.  Data                
              acquisition and analysis were accomplished (1983-1989) by the                  
              investigator during a stipendium with the Max-Planck Institut fur              
              Aeronomie, followed by a research consultancy at the British                   
              Antarctic Survey.  The seven papers now to be written will join                
              four already published, or accepted, which have resulted from prior            
              work.  Two papers present a new method for deriving ionospheric                
              vector velocities from high resolution Doppler and echolocation                
              analyses and undertaking their comparison with EISCAT bulk ion-                
              velocity measurements.  Three papers are concerned with new                    
              achievements in the development of data acquisition principles for             
              digital ionosondes.  They show progress toward a better                        
              understanding of the interplay of the processes of radio                       
              reflection, refraction, diffraction and dispersion in controlling              
              the information content of ionosonde echoes.  One paper                        
              demonstrates two new methods for the spatial representation of                 
              ionospheric soundings.  Two papers are concerned with natural                  
              (Joule) and artificial (radio) heating of the auroral ionosphere.
