Abstract    :
              This grant supports the International Culture Collection of                    
              Vesicular-Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi (INVAM) at West Virginia                
              University.  INVAM will collect, maintain, and distribute                      
              authenticated mycorrhizal fungi for research and education                     
              activities.  Mycorrhyzal fungi are important mutualistic                       
              microorganisms in that they have a principal role in maximizing                
              productivity and longevity of plants in natural and cultivated                 
              ecosystems.  Mycorrhyzal fungi are difficult to culture and                    
              maintain.  Research progress on this organism depends on a                     
              central repository of germplasm maintained under defined                       
              conditions.  INVAM is expected to serve as a focal point for                   
              mycorrhyzal research.
