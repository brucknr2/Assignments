Abstract    :
              This award will support a workshop on atomic and molecular                     
              physics to be held in Cuernavaca, Mexico, March 1991.  The                     
              workshop, organized by Professor Thomas Morgan of Wesleyan                     
              University and Professor Carmen Cisneros, Director of the                      
              Institute of Physics at Cuernavaca, will serve to continue                     
              the research and collaboration momentum that was developed as                  
              a result of two earlier workshops held in 1981 and 1986 and                    
              to initiate new research directions in this field for the                      
              1990`s.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              Many body and many electron effects in atomic and molecular                    
              structure and in collisions have received considerable                         
              attention during the last several years, and there is much                     
              current interest in these topics within the atomic and                         
              molecular physics community.  Significant experimental and                     
              theoretical progress has been made in the last few years on                    
              electron correlation and on some few-body problems and an                      
              initial understanding of many important aspects is now at                      
              hand.  However, the field in nascent and with proper guidance                  
              and stimulation it is likely that, in the near future,                         
              research on the more complex attributes of few-body problems                   
              and of electron correlation, and their consequences in                         
              differing physical phenomena, will produce conclusions of                      
              wide generality.  An important focus of the proposed workshop                  
              is to identify common features present in a diverse network                    
              of experimental and theoretical data.  The workshop aims to                    
              provide an atmosphere that promotes and encourages open                        
              presentation of ideas and free discussion in order to search                   
              for and identify the most influential characteristics                          
              responsible for the diversity of many body and many electron                   
              phenomena.
