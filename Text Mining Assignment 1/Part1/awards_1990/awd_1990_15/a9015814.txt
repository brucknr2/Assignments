Abstract    :
                This grant is to support travel to the International Union of                
              Geodesy and Geophysics meeting in Vienna, Austria, in August,                  
              1991.  The IUGG meets every four years.  By means of this block                
              travel grant, the American Geophysical Union administers an                    
              effective and equitable distribution of funds for partial travel               
              support without scientists having to apply individually to the                 
              NSF.  Screening committees, operated by the U.S. National                      
              Committee for the IUGG, are instructed to consider                             
              conscientiously minority applicants and to obtain a balance                    
              geographically and institutionally, according to career level,                 
              and according to discipline in order to maximize the impact of                 
              U.S. scientists on the meeting and the ultimate impact on U.S.                 
              science of the information gained by the participants.
