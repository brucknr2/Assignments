Abstract    :
              This is a project to maintain and augment as necessary, the network            
              of thirty-two automatic weather stations established on the                    
              antarctic continent and on several surrounding islands.  These                 
              weather stations measure surface wind, pressure, temperature,                  
              humidity, and in some instances other atmospheric variables, and               
              report these via satellite to a number of ground stations.  The                
              data are used for operational weather forecasting in support of the            
              United States Antarctic program, for climatological records, and               
              for research purposes.  The AWS network, which began as a                      
              small-scale program in 1980, has been extremely reliable and has               
              proven indispensable for both forecasting and research purposes.
