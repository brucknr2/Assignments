Abstract    :
              To advance the understanding of                                                
              somatic embryogenesis, the                                                     
              Principal Investigators (PIs) have                                             
              proposed a hypothesis in which form                                            
              development of the carrot embryo is                                            
              related to the combined effect of                                              
              nutrient, hormone and geometry.
