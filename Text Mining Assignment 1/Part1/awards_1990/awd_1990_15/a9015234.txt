Abstract    :
              Doubt remains concerning the age and nature of Late Cenozoic                   
              marine and glacial deposits along the coast of the Chukchi                     
              Peninsula, Siberia, and the correlation of these deposits                      
              with the Late Cenozoic sequence on nearby Alaskan coasts.  A                   
              better understanding of the Chukotkan sequence is especially                   
              needed in the light of recent confirmation that western St.                    
              Lawrence Island was over-run by large glaciers that                            
              originated on the mountainous Chukchi Peninsula.  Adding                       
              interest is the fact that glaciomarine deposits of middle                      
              Pleistocene age are reported to be widespread on the Chukchi                   
              coast.                                                                         
                                                                                             
              This award addresses these questions in a joint study with                     
              Soviet researchers intended to establish a new stratigraphic                   
              and geochronologic framework for regional late Cenozoic                        
              correlations.  Special attention will be given to the                          
              paleoclimate significance of the remarkable mid-Pleistocene                    
              event that evidently resulted in out-of-phase glaciation                       
              throughout central Beringia.  This project is proposed as a                    
              part of the program for U.S. - U.S.S.R. Cooperation in the                     
              Field of Basic Research.
