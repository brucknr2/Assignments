Abstract    :
              The Synthetic Organic Program continues to support the research                
              of Dr. William L. Jorgensen of the Department of Chemistry at                  
              Yale University.  His research is concerned with the                           
              interactive computer program, CAMEO, which is being developed                  
              to predict the products of organic reactions given starting                    
              materials and conditions.  The program uses mechanistic                        
              principles for broad classes of reactions to make its                          
              predictions.  The intent is for CAMEO to mimic the logical                     
              processes of a synthetic organic chemist as closely as                         
              possible.  Consequently, an important aspect of the project is                 
              to identify the logic and cast it in terms of fundamental                      
              organizing  principles governing organic reactions in addition                 
              to developing a tool to aid in the design of organic syntheses.                
                                                                                             
              The classes of reactions that have been implemented cover (1)                  
              base catalyzed processes, organometallic reactions, ylide                      
              chemistry and organosilicon chemistry, (2) electrophilic                       
              processes involving carbonium ions as intermediates including                  
              electrophilic aromatic substitution, and (3) pericyclic                        
              reactions, i.e., cycloadditions, electrocyclic processes and                   
              sigmatropic rearrangements.  Improved treatment of heterocyclic                
              chemistry is planned as well as new modules for the creation                   
              and reactions of carbenes, nitrenes, and free radicals.                        
              Standard oxidations and reductions of functional groups will                   
              also be implemented along with features to improve feedback to                 
              the user.
