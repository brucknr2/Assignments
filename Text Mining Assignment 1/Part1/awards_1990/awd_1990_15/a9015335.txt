Abstract    :
              This grant provides partial funding for the acquisition of a melt              
              rheometer.  Melt rheometry is a useful tool for developing an                  
              understanding of the temperature-dependent phase behavior in                   
              polymer systems with complex chain architectures.  The equipment               
              will be used in research on polyurethane systems, as well as on                
              thermotropic liquid crystalline systems.
