Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will support a four month visit by Professor                        
              Victor Kac of MIT to Pisa, Italy to carry out research with                    
              Professor Corrado DeConcini of the Scuola Normale in Pisa.                     
              The two mathmeticians intend to work on quantum groups at                      
              roots of unity and on quasiperiodic solutions of exceptional                   
              hierarchies of soliton equations.                                              
                                                                                             
              There has been a great deal of work recently on quantum                        
              groups Uq(g), where g is a finite-dimensional simple Lie                       
              algebra, for generic q.  For q = root of 1 the properties of                   
              Uq(g) are dramatically different.  The structure of the                        
              center of Uq(g) for this case is of particular interest to                     
              the researchers.  In the area of quasiperiodic solutions of                    
              soliton equations, thanks to the Krichever constructions                       
              Riemann theta functions are seen as solutions of the Kadomtsev-                
              Petviashvili (KP) equations.  This result has been extended                    
              to show that Prym theta functions are also solutions of KP                     
              equations of type B.  The proposed joint work will attempt to                  
              show that some further generalizations, for example the Prym-                  
              Tjurin theta functions, will also turn out to be solutions to                  
              other exceptional hierarchies of soliton equations.
