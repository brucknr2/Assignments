Abstract    :
                 Collections of thunderstorms known as mesoscale convective                  
              systems (MCS) are of scientific interest for a variety of                      
              reasons.  MCSs are a major source of rainfall and severe weather               
              (including lightening).  In addition, they are believed to be                  
              important to the vertical redistribution of atmospheric heating                
              which is important to global dynamics.                                         
                 Using numerical models and observational data from already                  
              completed field programs, the Principal Investigator will                      
              continue his research on MCSs.  This includes the general                      
              dynamical/microphysical MCS structures, the relationship between               
              MCS structures and lightening and the nature of the convective                 
              and mesoscale motions which impact the heat budget of these                    
              systems and the local environment.
