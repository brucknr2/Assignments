Abstract    :
              Program visualization refers to the use of graphics to illustrate some         
              aspect of a program execution.  Proper visual representations can              
              significantly enhance the understanding of complex computations.  The          
              objective of this project is to formulate and evaluate a new                   
              methodology for the visualization of concurrent computations, which is         
              to derive visualizations from a program's assertional-type proofs              
              rather than from a program's structure or operations.  Based on the            
              reasoning about program states by a proof system, the visualization            
              will be specified in a declarative style as a mapping from program             
              states to a three-dimensional world which is rendered by some graphics         
              display device.  A prototype visualization testbed to be built will            
              ultimately consist of a 64-node NCUBE-7 multicomputer connected via a          
              fiber optic link to a Silicon Graphics IRIS-4D graphics workstation.
