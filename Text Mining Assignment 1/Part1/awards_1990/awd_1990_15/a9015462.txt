Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              IPS-2 is a performance measurement system for parallel and                     
              distributed programs.  It allows application programmers to measure            
              their parallel programs (both shared-memory and distributed), and              
              produce execution profiles, graphs, and high-level analyses.  IPS-2            
              is in current use on VAX, DECstation (MIPS-based), and Sequent                 
              Symmetry computers, and has been used for a wide variety of                    
              performance tasks.                                                             
                                                                                             
              The goal of this project is to adapt and port IPS-2 to the                     
              supercomputer environment; specifically for the CRAY Y/MP under                
              UNICOS.  Providing IPS-2 under UNICOS will allow the system to be              
              available to several of the NSF Supercomputer sites.  This effort              
              will place powerful performance tools in the hands of an important             
              class of parallel programmers, i.e., those writing sophisticated               
              scientific applications.  IPS-2 should simplify the analysis of                
              complex programs, and make more efficient use of both hardware and             
              programmer resources.                                                          
                                                                                             
              The combination of the Wisconsin IPS-2 group and the NSF San Diego             
              Supercomputer Center staff provides both the performance measurement           
                                                                                             
              experience and the Cray UNICOS expertise to successfully transfer the          
                                                                                             
              IPS-2 system to a broader audience of researchers.//
