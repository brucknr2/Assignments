Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This grant supports Dr. Gombosi's efforts at modeling the                      
              environments of comets.  The main thrust of the work will be the               
              further development of a time-dependent, multidimensional dusty                
              model of the inner coma.  In addition, new models of the nucleus-              
              coma interface, the radiative transfer processes, as well as the               
              plasma environment of the comet will be developed.                             
                                                                                             
              The historic encounters with comets Halley and Giacobini-Zinner                
              have begun to lead to a better understanding of the major physical             
              and chemical processes controlling cometary environments.  The                 
              quantitative and qualitative leap of available information paved               
              the road to a new generation of comprehensive comet models, which              
              will synthesize our knowledge in such diverse areas as nucleus                 
              formation, orbital evolution, gas and dust emission, dynamics and              
              aeronomy of partially ionized dusty gas flows, and solar wind                  
              interaction.  A new generation of cometary models will evolve from             
              a series of intitiatives by various groups and individuals                     
              simultaneously cooperating and competing.  Dr. Gombosi will be an              
              active participant in this effort.
