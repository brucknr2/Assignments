Abstract    :
              The proposed research makes a connection between                               
              micromechanical modeling of particulate flow, supercomputer                    
              simulation techniques of governing equations, and experimental                 
              verification for fluidized bed technology.  The aim is to                      
              develop a predictive tool flow patterns and concentration                      
              distributions in fluidized beds, including for three-phase                     
              flow and circulating fluidized beds.  The kinetics theory of                   
              granular flow will be applied.  Time average and transient                     
              solids distributions will be measured and compared to the                      
              calculated patterns to guide development of the models.                        
                                                                                             
              The proposed numerical simulations in fluidized beds will                      
              improve our understanding for design purposes, scale-up,                       
              control in operation, and anticipation of possible problems                    
              such as erosion of internal structures or inadequate gas-solid                 
              contracting.
