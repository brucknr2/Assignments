Abstract    :
              This project is aimed at a systematic investigation of the                     
              variations of superconductive properties with thallium content and             
              carrier concentration in thallium cuprates.  Superconductive                   
              properties will be correlated with structure and chemical                      
              composition, including hole concentration and oxygen content, for              
              a number of thallium cuprate systems.  The proposed study will help            
              to gain an understanding of the superconductive mechanism, and will            
              also help to optimize synthetic procedures and chemical                        
              compositions required for more homogeneous materials with higher               
              Tc, or for the preparation of new materials.
