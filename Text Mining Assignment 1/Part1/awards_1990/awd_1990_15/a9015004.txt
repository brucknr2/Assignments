Abstract    :
              This award supports a visit by Dr. Robert E. McIntosh of the                   
              University of Massachusetts Amherst to the University of New                   
              South Wales, Australia, to work with Professor M.L. Banner to                  
              investigate sea state behavior under very strong wind                          
              forcing.  The proposed investigation would install unique                      
              instruments developed at the University of Massachusetts and                   
              NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center on a specially equipped                       
              Australian aircraft to collect and analyze data that would                     
              make significant advances in three important areas.  It would                  
              (1) establish the aerodynamic drag of the sea surface for                      
              very strong wind forcing conditions typical of intense                         
              storms, improving our ability to make reliable forecasts of                    
              sea state, (2) quantify the attributes of the ocean directional                
              wave spectrum under these extreme conditions, (3) determine                    
              the electromagnetic (EM) bias that the TOPEX satellite radar                   
              altimeter will be subject to for the very high seas and winds                  
              encountered in the Southern Ocean.  By establishing the                        
              relationship between the wind speed, wind stress, the wind                     
              wave field, and the EM bias for very high seas and winds, this                 
              project will have a major impact on improving the reliability                  
              of the algorithms used in remote sensing of the sea state and                  
              marine winds and of ocean forecasting, as well as improving                    
              the ability of satellite altimeters such as TOPEX to study                     
              the Southern Ocean circulation.
