Abstract    :
                   PIs will continue research on the role of intrinsic factors               
              in evolutionary rates and modes of marine invertebrates,                       
              centering on the bivalves and shelled gastropods in two reigons:               
              the Neocene (including Recent) of the eastern Pacific and the                  
              Late Cretaceous of the Gulf and Atlantic Coastal Plain.  PIs will              
              refine databases on developmental modes and geographic and                     
              bathymetric ranges, add data on body size and population                       
              densities, and collect more data on patterns of extinction,                    
              survival and rebound for European mollusks around the Cretaceous-              
              Tertiary (K-T) boundary.  PIs will test hypotheses on: separate                
              and continued effects of geographic range, developmental modes,                
              body size, population density, and preservation potential on                   
              evolutionary rates and patterns; relation of those patterns to                 
              bathymety and latitude; evolutionary trends in body size and the               
              frequency of Cope's Rule (broadly vs narrowly defined); and                    
              similarity of survivorship and rebound patterns at the K-T                     
              boundary in Europe and North America, and their relation to the                
              background patterns as listed above.
