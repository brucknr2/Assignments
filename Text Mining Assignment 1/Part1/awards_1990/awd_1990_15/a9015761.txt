Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Dr. Reiter plans to study the mechanisms involved in the regulation            
              of pineal melatonin production during the long nights (short days)             
              in the rat and the hamster.  The relative contribution of the                  
              different neurotransmitter systems as well as different components             
              of the same system may vary from species to species and also from              
              long day to short day conditions.  Investigation of mechanisms                 
              underlying sustained synthesis and secretion of melatonin will                 
              significantly enhance the understanding of melatonin's role in                 
              mammalian physiology.//
