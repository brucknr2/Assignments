Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This program looks at corrosion mechanisms in thin films of                    
              electronic materials with emphasis on atmospheric corrosion in                 
              copper.  In air copper develops a thin surface film of oxide.                  
              Subsequent exposure to moist environments containing corrosive                 
              gases, such as sulfur dioxide, aids the growth of corrosion                    
              products on the surface.  Of special interest are the microcell                
              corrosion processes pertaining to the conversion of an                         
              approximately 20 Angstrom film of cuprite to a 200 Angstrom film of            
              cuprite and copper sulfide.  The studies include corrosion of                  
              polycrystalline copper, single crystal copper, and vacuum-deposited            
              copper foils.  The thin film growth process, chemistry, structure,             
              and morphology are determined by several surface analytical                    
              techniques, including Auger spectroscopy, transmission electron                
              microscopy, and                                                                
              associated diffraction methods.                                                
              %%%                                                                            
              There is a need for improved understanding of atmospheric corrosion            
              of microelectronic devices to improve their resistance to                      
              degradation.  This research on copper provides a foundation for the            
              investigation of other metals, alloys and semiconductors of                    
              commercial importance in thin film technologies.
