Abstract    :
              Drs. Hoddeson and Westfall are continuing their exploration of the             
              critical features in the emergence of large-scale research in                  
              America through a close examination of the founding and first                  
              decades of operation of Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory                  
              (Fermilab), the base of the world's highest energy particle                    
              accelerator.  As the United States prepares to enter a new phase               
              in the pursuit of science on unprecedented scales, e.g., the                   
              Superconducting Super Collider (SSC), the Human Genome Project and             
              the Manned Space Station, deeper understanding of the workings of              
              "big science" through detailed case studies becomes especially                 
              vital.  Through research in documents, supplemented by oral history            
              interviews with leading participants, the project is designed to               
              examine historical problems of big science, including:  the effects            
              on research of increased size, scope, and cost of facilities and               
              experiments;  changes in research resulting from much larger                   
              working teams, budgets, and time-scales;  the role of theoretical              
              models and computer analysis in experimentation and accelerator                
              building; and the influences of geographical concentration,                    
              national and international politics, and economic policy.
