Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a proposal for the continued development and application of            
              a new transmission electron diffraction method for accurately                  
              measuring the electron density distribution of cations in various              
              crystalline materials. Electron beam techniques will enable the PIs            
              to study the structure of micro-crystals and "real" materials.                 
              Specifically, the PIs intend to:                                               
                *  determine the charge state of Cu in various oxides including              
                   oxide superconductors                                                     
                *  study the nature of bonding and crystal properties of MgO                 
                *  test theoretical calculations such as structure factors and               
                   the role of ionicity in structural phase transitions                      
                *  further develop the electron diffraction technique                        
              The results of this research will contribute to the understanding              
              of the crystal structure of a number of technologically important              
              semiconductor and ceramic materials.
