Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal is concerned with theoretical studies of order-                  
              disorder transitions.  Emphasis is placed on obtaining exact and               
              rigorous results and applying them to realistic model systems.                 
              Specific problems proposed include the interaction-around-a-face               
              model, the Ising model in a nonzero magnetic field, random systems,            
              directed percolation, and related topics.
