Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              With this award the Synthetic Organic Program will support the                 
              research of Dr. James D. White of the Department of Chemistry at               
              the Oregon State University. Dr. White will focus his efforts on               
              six areas of synthesis of heterocyclic natural products.                       
                                                                                             
              The proposed research is directed towards the chemical synthesis               
              of certain, specified target structures with the objective of                  
              advancing the present state of knowledge of the principles of                  
              organic synthesis and their application in the design of routes to             
              complex molecules. The research is focused on the synthesis of                 
              heterocyclic systems that present a significant challenge to                   
              contemporary methodology. The specific areas towards which the                 
              synthetic effort will be directed include -lactams (especially                
              antibiotics of the carbapenem group), alkaloids of the prianosin               
              family which possess significant cytotoxic activity, a                         
              structurally unique set of arachidonic acid metabolites related to             
              leukotriene, and a member of the nonadride group that exhibits                 
              hepatotoxic activity.
