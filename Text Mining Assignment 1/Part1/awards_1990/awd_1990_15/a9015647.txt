Abstract    :
                   The objectives of this research are: (1) optimum design and               
              control of the resistance brazing process using Taguchi-class                  
              optimization techniques; (2) investigation of the influence of                 
              process parameters on mechanical and electrical properties of the              
              brazed joints; and (3) development of a physical model based on                
              microstructural analysis in order to rationalize the results and               
              to enhance the understanding of brazeability of electrical                     
              contacts made out of dispersion-strengthened composites.                       
                   This study includes the development of an experimentally-                 
              based process model using Taguchi's experimental design approach.              
              The signal-to-noise ratio method will be used to analyze the                   
              results in order to explore the optimum process conditions that                
              yield the best joint quality with minimum variation about the                  
              target value.  The results of the metallurgical investigation                  
              will be correlated with fracture loads, fracture surface, and                  
              resistivity of the brazed joint.  This will provide a better                   
              understanding of the dependence of brazing joint microstructure                
              on processing variables such as brazing current, heating time,                 
              electrode force, and joint clearance.
