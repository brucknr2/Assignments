Abstract    :
                   This project will carry out basic research in theoretical                 
              nuclear physics on a range of topics of current interest                       
              including solar neutrino physics, fragmentation in nuclear                     
              collisions at intermediate energies and analyses of heavy-ion                  
              scattering phenomena.
