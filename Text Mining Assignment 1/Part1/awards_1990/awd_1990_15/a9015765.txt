Abstract    :
              In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of              
              the Chemistry Division, theoretical and experimental studies of                
              small clusters will be made in order to derive potential energy                
              parameters which might form the basis for functional group                     
              transferable intermolecular potentials.  One of the main                       
              objectives of this study is to develop a quantitative                          
              understanding of hydrogen bonding.  Quantum and semiclassical                  
              simulation methods will be used to predict cluster spectra and                 
              determine accurate potential energy surfaces for several organic               
              molecules.  High resolution infrared spectra of clusters formed                
              from these molecules will be measured using laser-molecular beam               
              techniques.  The experimental and theoretical results will be                  
              combined to develop group-transferable potential energy surfaces               
              that can be used in studies of energy relaxation and in molecular              
              modelling codes.

              One of the most fluorishing areas in physical chemistry is the                 
              study of the formation, structure, and dynamics of clusters in                 
              small molecular systems.  Such species are important in                        
              atmospheric and combustion chemistry and their properties can more             
              easily be calculated with present theories.  The proposed studies              
              will provide data which can be compared with existing theories to              
              test their validity and to stimulate more sophisticated models.                
              These models will ultimately lead to a detailed understanding of               
              environmentally and biologically significant systems.
