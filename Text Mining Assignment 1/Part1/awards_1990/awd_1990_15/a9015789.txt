Abstract    :
                   This industry internship project will be carried out in                   
              conjunction with MILCO, one of the largest textile industries in               
              the country.  The main products of MILCO are TRICO fabric for                  
              internal use as well as for sale to other companies, and ladies'               
              sleep wear for wholesale supply to large stores.  Currently, MILCO             
              has significant problems in maintaining high productivity due to               
              space limitations and the lack of an efficient computerized                    
              production planning and inventory control system.  The objectives              
              of this project are: (1)  provide MILCO with analytical tools to               
              study the various alternatives to solve their plant layout problem,            
              (2)  improving their marking and cutting operations, (3)  help them            
              to develop a long-term strategy for production planning and                    
              inventory control and, finally, (4)  establish a future                        
              collaboration with MILCO to work with research problems of their               
              interest.  It is also expected that the knowledge gained in this               
              project will have a significant impact on the Principal                        
              Investigator's long-term development as researchers and teachers.
