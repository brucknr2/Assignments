Abstract    :
                   The research will explore the effects of combustion assist                
              gases and ultraviolet/infrared laser combinations to develop                   
              efficient methods of machining materials that are conventionally               
              difficult-to-machine, such as the refractory metals (tungsten and              
              molybdenum), superalloys, and ceramics such as silicon carbide,                
              aluminum nitride, and composites.                                              
                   The specific goals are (1) to study the effects of                        
              infrared/ultraviolet combination laser sources, combustion-assist              
              gases, and gas-flow conditions on the cutting process, (2) to                  
              conduct experiments on difficult-to-machine materials, to verify               
              experimentally and augment the results of the analytical study, and            
              (3) to recommend methods to improve the effectiveness of laser                 
              cutting for thicknesses greater than 5 mm.  The specifics that will            
              be addressed include the effect of infrared/ultraviolet laser beams            
              on the absorption of laser energy, the effect of chemical reactions            
              on laser energy absorption, and the influence of combustion on the             
              cutting efficiency.
