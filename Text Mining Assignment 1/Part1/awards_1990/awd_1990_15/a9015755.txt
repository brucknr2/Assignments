Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The California Institute of Technology Submillimeter Observatory               
              (CSO) operates the only U.S. based submillimeter wavelength                    
              telescope.  With excellent sensitivity for both continuum and                  
              spectroscopic observations and with angular resolutions between 30             
              and 8 seconds of arc, innovative projects can be undertaken to                 
              provide critical new information in many fields of astronomy,                  
              including studies of the Solar System, our Galaxy, and                         
              extragalactic phenomena.                                                       
                                                                                             
              This grant will support a multifaceted scientific research and                 
              technology development program focussed on the 10.4 meter diameter             
              telescope of the CSO.  The telescope is sited at an altitude of                
              4100 meters on Mauna Kea, Hawaii, where the atmosphere is very dry             
              and ideal for observations at wavelengths as short as 320 microns.             
              During the grant period, new receivers should become available for             
              routine observations at wavelengths shorter than 800 microns.  One             
              half of the observing time is available for use by the general                 
              astronomy community.
