Abstract    :
              This U.S. - Italy award will support a planning meeting between U.S.           
              and Italian astronomers concerned with instrumentation for the                 
              Galileo telescope.  This telescope will be built on Mauna Kea, Hawaii          
              as a result of a collaboration between the University of Hawaii and            
              the Italian Ministry_for Scientific Research.  The meeting, organized          
              by Professors Donald Hall and R. Brent Tully of the University of              
              Hawaii and Professor C. Barbieri of the Astronomical Observatory of            
              Padova, will provide an opportunity for Italian and U.S. Astronomers           
              to make specific decisions on what instrumentation will be built for           
              the early years of the telescope and who will build them.them.                 
                                                                                             
              Design specifications and concepts will be discussed.  With each               
              instrument there will be supervisory and advisory roles split between          
              the two communities of astronomers and the meeting will serve to               
              clarify and assign these responsibilities.  In addition, the meeting           
              will help to establish instrumentation priorities.
