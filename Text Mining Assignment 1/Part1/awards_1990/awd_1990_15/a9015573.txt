Abstract    :
                   Relative to the large effort that has been devoted to design              
              problems of new processes, there has been relatively little work               
              on developing methodologies for the optimal redesign of existing               
              processes that can be performed with limited resources.  The                   
              primary objective of the research is to perform a systematic                   
              study on the optimal redesign of existing processes through the                
              use of synthesis simulation and optimization techniques.                       
                   The investigation will develop methodologies for the optimal              
              redesign problem of existing processes that will be applicable to              
              other engineering disciplines.  In particular, the design of (a)               
              heat and power systems, (b) complex reactor networks, (c)                      
              reactor-separator systems, (d) separation systems and (e) systems              
              that involve stochastic uncertainties will be addressed.                       
              Theoretical models coupled with insights are expected to result                
              in redesign conceptual frameworks that will enhance the                        
              designer's ability to innovate.
