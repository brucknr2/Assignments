Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The research focuses on two questions important to our                         
              understanding of the dynamics of convection on the Sun:                        
                                                                                             
                   1)  Can the pattern of convection on the Sun's surface be                 
              attributed to the depth variation of the specific heat of the                  
              fluid, as its constituent gases become ionized?                                
                                                                                             
                   2)  How well can the nonlinear dynamics of the observed                   
              convection be represented by a smaller model involving                         
              interactions of only a few linear eigenmodes?  These questions                 
              will be addressed by a computer simulation involving code                      
              optimization for the parallel/vector environment at the Cornell                
              National Supercomputer Facility; and the construction of a                     
              graphical interface for simulation data, which will provide a                  
              testing ground for advancing the state of the art in scientific                
              visualization.  Special emphasis will be given to:                             
                                                                                             
                        (a)  incorporation of next-generation software for                   
                             interactive data rendering in three dimensions                  
                        (b)  creation of modular, high-level (Unix/C) software               
                             tools that could be utilized by other researchers               
                             for building interfaces,                                        
                        (c)  operation of the interface over a network (with X               
                             Windows).
