Abstract    :
              Geanakoplos                                                                    
              Zuck                                                                           
              This research is funded under the Special Initiative on                        
              Coordination Theory and Collaboration Technology.  This is one of              
              eleven winners under that competition.                                         
              How to make decisions in the face of uncertainty is a core                     
              problem in many computer science and economic modelling problems.              
              However, there are a number of weaknesses in the traditional                   
              approaches to modelling knowledge.  Among them are assumption                  
              that there are perfect reasoners and that inferences can be based              
              on arbitrarily deep levels of knowledge.  This research on                     
              coordination theory is to develop a new notion of practical                    
              knowledge upon which to base coordinated decision making.                      
              Practical knowledge will take account of several factors which                 
              limit a reasoner's deductive ability such as computational                     
              resources available to the reasoner,  imperfections in the                     
              reasoner's ability to carry out correct deductions, and                        
              faultiness and incompleteness in the data available to the                     
              reasoner.  Many of these factors have been studied previously in               
              isolation.  This research extends and unifies such work in order               
              to come up with a comprehensive theory of sound reasoning in a                 
              practical multi-agent environment.
