Abstract    :
                   The objective of this industry internship is to develop a                 
              Computer Integrated Production Planning and Control (CIRR & C)                 
              system for the process of furniture manufacturing.  The project                
              will be carried out in collaboration with the Forestry Science                 
              Laboratory in Princeton, West Virginia.  The work will focus on                
              the functional and mathematical integration of the network of                  
              methodologies which constitute a CIRR & C system for this                      
              environment.  This research is generic in nature and will be                   
              applicable to other industrial settings.
