Abstract    :
                   This grant supports research and operation of the Princeton               
              Cyclotron Laboratory.  The group will carry out measurements at                
              the frontiers of nuclear physics, nuclear astrophysics, and                    
              fundamental symmetries and interactions.  The experiments will                 
              extend the search for time reversal invariance in nuclear                      
              systems, for meson exchange currents in beta decay, and for                    
              axion-like particles in electron-positron interactions.  Other                 
              experiments will use specially developed equipment to study the                
              properties of nuclei far from stability.  A series of                          
              measurements using the Princeton QDDD magnetic spectrometer will               
              provide new date concerning astrophysical processes that occurred              
              in the early moments of the universe.                                          
                   A related program of accelerator improvement and of                       
              advanced instrumentation development will continue.  The                       
              accelerator improvements are aimed at increasing both performance              
              and reliability.  The instrumentation research and development                 
              will include work on bolometer radiation detectors.                            
                   The Cyclotron Laboratory is used for research and for                     
              graduate student training by a large number of user groups from                
              other universities, in addition to those from Princeton.
