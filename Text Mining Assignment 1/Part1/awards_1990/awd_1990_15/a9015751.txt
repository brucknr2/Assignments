Abstract    :
                   An international collaboration including scientists from                  
              Heidelberg, Oxford, Southampton, Strathclyde, and Yale                         
              Universities, and the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in England                
              is undertaking an accurate measurement of the 1S-2S transition                 
              frequency in muonium, absolutely and relative to the 1S-2S                     
              transition in atomic hydrogen.                                                 
                   This grant supports the participation of Boshier and                      
              Hughes from Yale University.  A significant test of QED is                     
              anticipated, largely because of a recently discovered method                   
              for producing muonium atoms in vacuum with thermal energies,                   
              which is expected to provide a usable muonium flux two orders                  
              of magnitude greater than previously available.
