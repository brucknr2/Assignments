Abstract    :
              This grant will support an International Conference in Stochastic              
              Partial Differential Equations (SPDE's), May 6-8, 1990, and a                  
              satellite School-Seminar in the same topic for new researchers,                
              May 3-5.  Both activities will be held at the University of North              
              Carolina at Charlotte.  The purpose of the conference is to bring              
              together researchers who are working on different theoretical and              
              applied aspects of SPDE's and to promote research in this field.               
              The purpose of the School-Seminar is to bring the subject of                   
              SPDE's to the attention of new researchers (graduate students,                 
              postdocs and recent Ph.D.'s) and provide them with a unique                    
              opportunity to be taught by, meet, and have discussions with the               
              outstanding scientists working in the area.                                    
              The introductory sessions scheduled for the School-Seminar are                 
              linear elliptic and parabolic SPDE's, methods in non-linear                    
              SPDE's, and applications of SPDE's.  The main part of the                      
              conference will cover recent theoretical developments in SPDE's                
              and various applications, especially to oceanography and signal                
              processing.
