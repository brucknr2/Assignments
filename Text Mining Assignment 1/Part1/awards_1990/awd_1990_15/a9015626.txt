Abstract    :
              This SMALL GRANT for EXPEDITED RESEARCH award is made in order to              
              develop an optical technique for the measurement of crack growth               
              at elevated temperatures.  The need is to evaluate the sensitivity             
              of the method of caustics at the high temperatures.
