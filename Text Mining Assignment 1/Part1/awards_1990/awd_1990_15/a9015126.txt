Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This action is for support of the Second                                       
              International Conference on Recent Advances                                    
              in Geotechnical Earthquake Engineering and                                     
              Soil Dynamics, to be held in St. Louis,                                        
              Missouri, March 11-15, 1991.  The first                                        
              conference was held April 26-May 2, 1981.                                      
              During the intervening 10 years, impressive                                    
              advances have taken place in geotechnical                                      
              earthquake engineering, and major earthquakes                                  
              have occurred around the world (such as the                                    
              1985 earthquakes in Chile and Mexico); and                                     
              the Loma Prieta earthquake of 1989                                             
              highlighted the destruction that can occur in                                  
              a major metropolis as a result of a moderate                                   
              earthquake.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              This conference is co-sponsored by eleven                                      
              major and international organizations with a                                   
              strong interest in geotechnical earthquake                                     
              engineering.  The themes for the conference                                    
              cover all aspects of the subject, from                                         
              structures on land to offshore structures                                      
              (especially those used in oil exploration);                                    
              the safety of dams, retaining walls,                                           
              hazardous waste and sanitary landfills; the                                    
              performance of building foundations; the use                                   
              of geotextiles for earthquake hazard                                           
              mitigation; the performance of lifelines;                                      
              landslides and the stability of slopes.                                        
              Thirteen internationally recognized speakers                                   
              will present state-of-the-art presentations                                    
              and many members of the Steering Committee                                     
              and the Organizing Committee are

              engineers.  A special session addresses                                        
              lessons learned from the 1989 Loma Prieta                                      
              earthquake.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              The proceedings from this conference will                                      
              present the state of the art in geotechnical                                   
              earthquake engineering and will contribute to                                  
              research and implementation of earthquake                                      
              hazard mitigation.  This conference will be                                    
              an important early contribution to the                                         
              International Decade of Natural Disaster
