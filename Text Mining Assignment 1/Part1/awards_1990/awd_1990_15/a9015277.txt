Abstract    :
                   This research will develop an information and decision                    
              theoretic model of integration and identify the characterizing                 
              information requirements for three major functions of                          
              manufacturing: process design, production planning, and shop                   
              floor control.  The model development will be conducted in two                 
              phases.  In Phase I, the investigators will unite previous                     
              results in several major disciplines of the literature to uncover              
              the basic sub-functions, decision spaces, logical                              
              interrelationships, and required data classes and knowledge                    
              classes pertaining to these functions.  In Phase II, the model                 
              will be calibrated to certain previous efforts, using empirical                
              results obtained from the industry-sponsored Computer Integrated               
              Manufacturing Program at Rensselaer.                                           
                   This research focuses on integration issues that are crucial              
              to the development of competitive manufacturing systems.  The                  
              results should provide considerable insight into the information-              
              theoretic aspects of future manufacturing systems.
