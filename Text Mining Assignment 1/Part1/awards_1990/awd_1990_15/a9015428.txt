Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                            
              The purpose of this project is to investigate a number of                      
              theoretical issues in language acquisition through an                          
              experimental study of binding in Icelandic.  "Binding" refers                  
              tosystematic constraints on the relationship between pronouns and              
              their antecedents.  Icelandic is a very interesting language for               
              studying the acquisition of binding, as it has binding properties              
              that are distinct from English.  In particular, Icelandic has a                
              "long distance" reflexive construction which has generated                     
              considerable interest in linguistic theory and has motivated                   
              theoretical work in language acquisition as well.                              
                                                                                             
              The data will be collected in Reykjavik, Iceland.  30 children,                
              ages 3;0-6;0, will serve as subjects of three experiments                      
              designed to determine their interpretations of reflexives and                  
              pronouns, and thus to illuminate the course of the acquisition of              
              binding in Icelandic.                                                          
                                                                                             
              The results of this study will bear on a number of issues in                   
              acquisition theory and linguistic theory.  First, it will provide              
              a description of the Icelandic child's acquisition of binding, an              
              area which has received very little attention, and thus will                   
              contribute to the growing body of cross-linguistic research into               
              the development of binding.  In addition, it will illuminate                   
              aspects of the syntax of Icelandic, in particular, the linguistic              
              analysis of long distance reflexives.  Finally, the study has                  
              direct implications for general linguistic theory and for the                  
              developmental processes involved in the acquisition of syntax.
