Abstract    :
              This research is funded under the Special Initiative on                        
              Coordination Theory and Collaboration Technology.  This is one of              
              eleven winners under that competition.                                         
              This study investigates certain aspects of the role of computerized            
              information systems as instruments of coordination in complex                  
              organizations.  Questions addressed in this research include:  What            
              kinds of coordination problems do computerized systems actually                
              resolve, and to what extent?  What social and economic impacts                 
              result from the use such systems?  The research gathers empirical              
              data through cross sectional studies, comparative case studies and a           
              longitudinal survey of manufacturing firms that have relatively                
              structured systems that can be characterized as Computer Integrated            
              Manufacturing.  Results expected from the research include                     
              empirically grounded accounts of the role of computerized                      
              information systems in coordinating activities of complex                      
              organizations and increased theoretical understanding of the                   
              economic and sociological impacts of these information systems.
