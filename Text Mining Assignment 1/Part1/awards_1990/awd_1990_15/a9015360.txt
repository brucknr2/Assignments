Abstract    :
              The workshop is aimed at working research scientists who have                  
              basic knowledge of the field and need to become better acquainted              
              with computational modeling strategies.  The sub-title of the                  
              workshop: programs, methodology, selection, troubleshooting,                   
              emphasizes this point.  Speakers from academia and industry will               
              describe current new methodologies, compare parameterization                   
              schemes, and share strategies.  NCSA with its strengths in                     
              visualization and supercomputer applications will address a                    
              critical need for comparison and evaluation of high-performance                
              computing methods and capabilities.  The workshop will help                    
              transfer high performance computing technology from front-line                 
              modeling research laboratories, both academic and industrial, into             
              the hands of a wider audience.  In general, the workshop will                  
              address the needs of researchers interested in using modeling                  
              methods as a tool to solve biological problems.
