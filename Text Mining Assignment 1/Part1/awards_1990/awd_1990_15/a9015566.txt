Abstract    :
              With this grant in the Theoretical and Computational Program of                
              the Chemistry Division, Professor Cioslowski will develop new                  
              methods for the qualitative understanding and description of                   
              the results of modern electronic structure calculations. He                    
              will construct, test and implement a set of standard tools for                 
              interpretation of the molecular wave functions which will lead                 
              to a deeper understanding of chemical bonding.                                 
                                                                                             
              The research will implement a new method of orbital                            
              localization based on the orbital density analysis of Bader                    
              extended to correlated wave functions. These orbitals will be                  
              used to discuss the bonding in molecular complexes and to                      
              develop compact representations of excited state wave                          
              functions. Professor Cioslowski  will also develop a new index                 
              for addressing the question of molecular similarity  and in                    
              addition will develop a method  for using pseudo-Wannier                       
              orbitals in the calculation of the excited electronic states of                
              polymers.
