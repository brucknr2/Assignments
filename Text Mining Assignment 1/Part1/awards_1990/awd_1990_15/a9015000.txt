Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Novel computational methods for quantum statistical models,                    
              including models of solid helium 3 and other frustrated spin                   
              systems, models related to Boson localization relevant to                      
              superfluid helium 4 in porous media, and models for strongly                   
              correlated electronic materials including the High Temperature                 
              Superconductors.  In the Boson localization problem the study of               
              thermodynamics and dynamics will include utilizing known                       
              algortihms but with implementation and optimization on massively               
              parallel computer architectures.  Finally, for the strongly                    
              correlated electron problems work on the "marriage" of Monte                   
              Carlo and many body theory methods to avoid the problems of the                
              restricted parameter and temparature regime to which fermion                   
              Monte Carlo applies.  Overall, studies will utilize methodologies              
              ranging from  improved path integral Monte Carlo algorithms to                 
              new variational methods and methods based on generalizations of                
              the decoupled cell Monte Carlo method.  The hardware will include              
              both pipelined and parallel supercomputer architectures.
