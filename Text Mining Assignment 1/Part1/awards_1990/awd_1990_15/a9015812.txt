Abstract    :
              This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program will support a                    
              series of three annual "Workshops on Reactive Intermediates".                  
              These workshops have the dual purposes of (1) providing an                     
              effective forum for informal discussion by active scientists of                
              current research in topical areas of organic dynamics, and (2)                 
              assisting the Program staff in identifying areas of research in                
              organic dynamics that should be incorporated into the Program's                
              long-range planning.                                                           
                                                                                             
              Each workshop will bring together approximately 18 active                      
              scientists from around the United States for discussions of                    
              current research in mechanisms of organic chemical reactions,                  
              with a focus on unpublished results and an emphasis on critical                
              evaluation of research in progress.  The informal discussion                   
              format is intended to stimulate challenge and criticism, to                    
              facilitate the development of collaborative approaches to                      
              shared research problems, and to prevent unproductive                          
              duplicative efforts.   The participants are drawn widely from                  
              the community of physical, organic, and organometallic chemists                
              studying the chemistry of reactive intermediates, and a                        
              particular effort is made to incorporate young investigators,                  
              women, and underrepresented minority scientists into the                       
              mainstream of research activities in the area of organic                       
              dynamics.  The topics chosen for discussion are selected to                    
              complement, not compete with, other established and more formal                
              conferences.
