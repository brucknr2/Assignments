Abstract    :
              Willsky         There are three major components of this research program  which
              has as its overall objective the development of new classes  of algorithms for
              statistical signal processing and estimation of  spatial and multidimensional
              data.  The first is the development  of statistical models and methods for
              multiscale signal analysis  and processing in one and several dimensions. 
              Problems that are  being addressed include the development of a statistical 
              counterpart to the emerging theory of multiresolution signal  decompositions
              and wavelet transforms, the investigation of  iterative, multigrid signal
              processing algorithms, and  applications of these methods to topics ranging
              from inverse  reconstruction problems to problems of signal or image 
              segmentation.         The second is the development of efficient algorithms for
               processing spatial data.  This topic focuses on the exploitation  of the
              structure of noncausal models, such as those described by  partial difference
              equations or Markov random fields, in order to  develop extremely efficient and
              highly parallel algorithms.   Specific problems being investigated include the
              employment of  radially inward and outward recursions for multidimensional 
              signal processing, parallel processing structures based on  spatial
              partitioning of multidimensional signal processing, and  the development of
              efficient algorithms for tracking motion and  other temporal changes in
              space-time random fields.         The third is the development of statistical
              methods for  estimating or reconstructing geometric features in 
              multidimensional data given uncertain measurements of various  quantities, such
              as the support of a convex object in 2-D or 3-D,  or the 2-D silhouette of 3-D
              objects.
