Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary objective of this US-Bulgaria research                             
              project between Dr. Koji Nakanishi of Columbia University                      
              and Dr. Nina Berova of The Bulgarian Institute of                              
              Organic Chemistry is to examine biopolymers using                              
              exciton chirality methods.  Pectins will be featured for                       
              overall classification and determination of glycosidic                         
              linkages.  In their work, the researchers intend to                            
              develop and employ a new set of cyanine dyes that react                        
              with amino groups for absolute configuration of alkaloids                      
              and amino sugars.  (These dyes are chosen for unique                           
              spectroscopic properties, requiring only nanogram sample                       
              quantities.)  Results are expected to extend the                               
              methodology for determining microstructure of complex,                         
              irregular polysaccharides such as pectin and would allow                       
              for the determination of absolute configurations of                            
              small amounts of rare sugars and the frequency and                             
              points of branching in glycosidic linkages.                                    
                                                                                             
              This project in organic chemistry fulfills the program                         
              objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling                        
              leading researchers in the United States and Eastern                           
              Europe to combine complementary talents and pool                               
              research resources in areas of strong mutual interest                          
              and competence.
