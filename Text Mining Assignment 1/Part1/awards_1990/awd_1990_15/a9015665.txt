Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research is developing an understanding of the mechanical                 
              properties of cubic forms of trialuminides.  Phase stability and               
              ductility of cubic forms of aluminum-titanium-chromium and                     
              aluminum-titanium-manganese ternary alloys are the focus of the                
              study.  Part of the phase stability work involves the effect of                
              fourth element additions on the extent of the cubic phase (L12)                
              region.  This includes the determination of specific element site              
              occupation, atomic size and electronic structure. Micromechanisms              
              associated with the dislocations accounting for plastic flow in                
              the alloys are being studied.  It is expected that the research                
              will contribute to the knowledge base needed for the development               
              of new families of low density, heat-resistant alloys that have                
              high specific strengths and excellent oxidation resistance.
