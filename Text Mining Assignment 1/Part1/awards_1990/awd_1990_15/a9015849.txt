Abstract    :
              The focus of this project in the Organic Chemical Dynamics                     
              Program is the chemistry of organosulfur compounds. This family                
              of compounds includes a number of substances of vital                          
              importance in biological systems, important starting materials                 
              and intermediates in synthetic organic chemistry, and several                  
              compounds which play important roles in environmental chemistry.               
                                                                                             
              The project will emphasize reaction intermediates and unstable                 
              species which are involved in the synthesis and reaction                       
              mechanisms of selected organic compounds of sulfur and other                   
              chalcogens. One phase of the project will be the study of the                  
              chemistry of imidazole-2-chalcogenones (-2-thiones;                            
              -2-selenones; -2-tellurones). This will include a kinetic and                  
              mechanistic study of charge transfer complex formation with                    
              halogens and cyanogen halides, the preparation and chemistry of                
              imidazolyl sulfines, selenines and tellurines. In another                      
              aspect of the project, the oxidation of disulfides,                            
              trisulfides, thioozonides, sulfenic acids, and sulfinic acids                  
              will be investigated. The mechanisms and products from the                     
              reactions of sulfinyl halides with light, heat, amides,                        
              sulfenic acids, and sulfines will be studied. Molecular orbital                
              calculations will be performed for many of the reaction                        
              intermediates and products.
