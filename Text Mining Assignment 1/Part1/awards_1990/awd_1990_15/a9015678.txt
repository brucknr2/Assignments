Abstract    :
              The transfer of material from one star to another in close                     
              "interacting binary" star systems appears to proceed at a highly               
              uneven pace.  The evolution of these systems depends sensitively               
              on the average mass transfer rate. Therefore a clarification of the            
              nature of these modulations is important to an understanding of                
              both the origin and fate of these systems.  The Principal                      
              Investigator (PI) has received NSF support in the past to modernize            
              and automate the 16-inch telescope at Indiana University to conduct            
              measures of star brightnesses (photometry) more accurately and                 
              efficiently than in the past.  The PI now plans to use this                    
              equipment as well as a 40-inch telescope at U.S. Naval Observatory             
              in Flagstaff, Arizona to conduct coordinated observations every                
              available clear night for three years of a sample of stars from                
              three classes of interacting binaries: cataclysmic binaries, dwarf             
              novae, and "Algol" binaries.  The processes to be studied occur                
              over timescales of days to years.  The research includes tests of              
              the "hibernation theory" of nova evolution, the determination of               
              the relationship of the "supermaxima" to other features in the                 
              light curves of dwarf novae, and the search for activity cycles in             
              Algol systems.
