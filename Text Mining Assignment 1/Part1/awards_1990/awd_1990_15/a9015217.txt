Abstract    :
              The floating-zone process is an important method for growing                   
              single crystals of electronic, optical and high-Tc oxide                       
              superconducting materials.  The shape of the melt/gas                          
              interface, i.e., the free surface of the melt zone, can                        
              significantly affect zone stability, which is critical to the                  
              successful operation of the process.  The shape of the                         
              melt/crystal interface, as well as the solute and temperature                  
              distributions in the growing crystal, can significantly affect                 
              the crystal quality.  These interface shapes and distributions                 
              are governed by transport processes such as heat transfer,                     
              mass transfer and fluid flow during crystal growth.  In this                   
              project, analysis of the interfacial stability problem will be                 
              undertaken simultaneously with the study of heat and mass                      
              transport during crystal growth.  It is expected that this                     
              integrated approach will contribute to the manufacture of                      
              larger single crystals and of purer and larger samples in zone                 
              refining.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              The research consists of three parts:  1. crystal growth and                   
              zone-stability improvement,  2. flow observation and                           
              segregation analysis, and  3. computer simulation.  The study                  
              is unique in that the interaction between convection in the                    
              melt zone and the shapes of the melt/solid interfaces will be                  
              clearly demonstrated through direct observations of a                          
              transparent melt zone during actual crystal simulation.
