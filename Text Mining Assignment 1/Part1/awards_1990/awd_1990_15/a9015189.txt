Abstract    :
                   The object of this research is the physics of maritime                    
              clouds and precipitation, including the nature of mixing between               
              clouds and their environment, the capacity of this process to                  
              moisten the region surrounding such clouds, the relative                       
              importance of ice and water drops in producing precipitation in                
              such clouds, and the physics of "ship tracts", the trails of                   
              condensation often produced by ships.
