Abstract    :
              This is a two-year collaborative project between Wai-Fah                       
              Chen of Purdue University and H.B. Wu and S.P. Zhou of the                     
              Chongqing Institute of Architecture and Engineering of China                   
              (CIAEC).  It is supported by the National Science Foundation                   
              and the National Science Foundation of China.                                  
                                                                                             
              Stability analysis and design of steel structures is one of                    
              the most important structural engineering problems today.                      
              Several important structural stability problems of similar                     
              type exist in the United States and China, despite their                       
              differences in scale.  In this project, the principal inves-                   
              tigators will undertake full-scale experimental tests and                      
              analytical modeling to attempt to solve stability problems                     
              in steel framed structures.  The Purdue team will work                         
              principally on the expanded data bank for semi-rigid                           
              connections and on the basic mathematical formulation and                      
              computer-based model development.  The CIAEC team will work                    
              principally on the full-scale tests.  Each team will spend                     
              time in the other's facility.  It is expected that major                       
              findings resulting from the cooperative research will                          
              provide the necessary basis for possible next revision of                      
              current Specifications for Design, Fabrication and Erection                    
              of Structural Steel for Buildings, which are used in the                       
              United States and China.
