Abstract    :
                   The formation, energy transfer processes, and chemical                    
              reactions of the ozone excited states will be investigated and a               
              kinetic model of these processes, based upon the experimental                  
              results, will be constructed.  Specifically, they plan to measure              
              the wavelength dependence of the absolute quantum yields as                    
              functions of wavelength, pressure, gas composition, and                        
              temperature, and to investigate chemical reactions of the excited              
              ozone states.   The research is motivated by the need to assess                
              the potential atmospheric importance of ozone excited states                   
              which cannot be accomplished until the states, the quantum yields              
              for production, the wavelength dependencies, the products of the               
              quenching steps, the connections among the several observed                    
              states, and the rate coefficients for the elementary reactions                 
              have been identified.
