Abstract    :
                   This project represents the continuation of research begun                
              as a pilot study in which the application of a new mathematical                
              technique, known as the contour dynamics method, to the study of               
              atmospheric dynamics was investigated.  The initial results of                 
              that study are sufficiently promising to warrant continuing the                
              research.  The project involves the collaboration of Dr. Alan                  
              Plumb of MIT and Dr. Lorenzo Polvani of Columbia University who                
              is funded under ATM-9020999.                                                   
                   The contour dynamics method provides a means to resolve                   
              fine structure of fields at relatively low computational expense.              
              This is particularly useful for studies of the behavior of the                 
              stratospheric polar vortex.  Disturbances to this vortex, in the               
              form of upwardly propogating large-scale waves, often result in                
              the breaking off from the main vortex of filaments and secondary               
              vortices;  this air then mixes into the middle latitude regions,               
              affecting the overall circulation of the stratosphere.  This                   
              study will attempt to better define the nonlinear dynamical                    
              processes involved.  The Principal Investigators also hope to                  
              begin exploring the dynamics of synoptic-scale eddies in the                   
              troposphere using the same techniques.
