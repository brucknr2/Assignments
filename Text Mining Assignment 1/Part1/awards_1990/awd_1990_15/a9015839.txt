Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary objective of this U.S.-Poland research project                     
              between Dr. Ralph Jaccodine of Lehigh University and                           
              Dr. Wojciech Fabianowski of Warsaw Technical University is                     
              to examine and characterize new monolayer coupling agents                      
              which interact both with metal and polymers.  The researchers                  
              intend to determine the mechanical and electrical properties                   
              of these metal-monolayer-polymer composite structures.                         
              Results should be useful in addressing multiple problems                       
              associated with joining dissimilar materials in a range of                     
              applications.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              This project in materials research fulfills the program                        
              objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling                        
              experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to combine                     
              complementary talents and pool research resources in areas                     
              of strong mutual interest and competence.
