Abstract    :
              This award supports research on ways for computer vision systems               
              to exploit the Computer Aided Design models available for many                 
              manufactured objects.  The goal is to learn how to build a vision              
              system capable of recognizing and locating instances of curved 3D              
              objects modeled by parametric surface patches and their                        
              intersection curves in the imperfect line drawing obtained by                  
              edge detection from a single image.  Ongoing implementation of                 
              research system building blocks will be completed, including                   
              specialized components of a solid modeler, algorithms for                      
              constructing exact aspect graphs of object models, and techniques              
              for locating model instances from image contours.  Novel                       
              recognition strategies will be investigated, based on both                     
              object- and viewer-centered representations.  New data structures              
              and algorithms will be developed that efficiently implement these              
              strategies; these will be integrated into a working recognition                
              system.  A notable aspect of this research is the systematic                   
              characterization of geometric constraints by polynomial                        
              equations, which may then be solved by application of available                
              computational and mathematical tools.
