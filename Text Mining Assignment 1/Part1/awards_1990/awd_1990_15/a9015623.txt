Abstract    :
              This research seeks to design an apparatus capable of measuring                
              permeability of wafers/disks drilled through a weathered surface.              
              Permeability changes can then be compared with more standard                   
              petrologic and geochemical analyses.  The ability to make such                 
              determinations has a wide range of theoretical and practical                   
              applications, but has not been done heretofore.
