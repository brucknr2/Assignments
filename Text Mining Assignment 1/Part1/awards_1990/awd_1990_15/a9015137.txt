Abstract    :
              This award will support collaborative research between Dr.                     
              James Byrnes of the University of Massachusetts at Boston and                  
              Dr. Gavin Brown of the University of New South Wales. The                      
              research is to advance theoretical understanding of the                        
              properties of trigonometic sums with restricted coefficients,                  
              and to explore the application of these results to important                   
              engineering problems. A primary focus of the project is to                     
              resolve the question of how close to constant the modulus of                   
              a polynomial can be along a curve, typically the unit circle,                  
              in which case, the polynominal is a finite trigonometric sum.                  
              This question is important both to theoretical mathematical                    
              analysis because of the fundamental nature of polynominals,                    
              and to engineering because of the applicability of the work                    
              to the problem of minimizing peak to average ratios of power                   
              in transmitter design.                                                         
                                                                                             
              The project represents excellent collaboration between the                     
              U.S. and Australian researchers in that both are at the point                  
              of expanding their parallel expertise in classical mathe-                      
              matical analysis to the solution of engineering problems,                      
              important to both countries. This is significant fundamental                   
              work in an important area of mathematical research, as well                    
              as having the potential for solving major engineering                          
              problems.
