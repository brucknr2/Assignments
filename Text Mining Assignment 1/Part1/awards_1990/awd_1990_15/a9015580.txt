Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A new and novel technique will be developed for the                            
              determination of amorphous silica in marine sediments.  It is                  
              based on the high temperature titration of amorphous silica                    
              with added calcium carbonate according to the reaction:  SiO2 +                
              CaCO3 ----- CaSiiO3 + CO2.  The proposed research will proceed                 
              along three lines:  1. Further development of the method.                      
              Preliminary pyrolysis experiments were done at 500oC for three                 
              days.  Subsequent work was at 700oC for one hour.  These new                   
              conditions necessitate the repetition of many experiments to                   
              determine the optimum temperature and time and the dependence                  
              of the reaction on mineralogy, water content etc. for the                      
              optimum conditions.  2. Revaluation of the marine silica                       
              budget.  Preliminary work indicates that calcareous oozes and                  
              continental shelf sediments are much more important sinks than                 
              previously believed.  3. The use of the &18O of the product CO2                
              as a measure of the &18O of amorphous silica and the paleocean                 
              from which it was deposited.  //
