Abstract    :
              With support from the Organic Dynamics Program, Dr. Rudolph A.                 
              Abramovitch will study the synthesis and chemistry of                          
              five-membered heterocyclic nitrenium ions. These species are                   
              highly reactive intermediates whose chemical reactivity is of                  
              interest to physical organic chemists and to theoretical                       
              chemists. In addition to their inherent theoretical interest,                  
              these species are of potential importance as a new class of                    
              electrophilic primary aminating agents that are of interest to                 
              synthetic organic chemists as well.                                            
                                                                                             
              Of particular interest is the potential ability of these                       
              species to undergo isomerization to other cationic systems.                    
              The generation and trapping of these heterocyclic sigma-cations                
              by nucleophiles will be studied via ion cyclotron resonance                    
              mass spectrometry in an effort to obtain information concerning                
              the operation of pi-to-sigma "electronic isomerizations" in the                
              nitrenium ions. Trapping experiments will also be performed in                 
              solution with the same objective in mind. Detailed analysis of                 
              the various reaction products thereby obtained is expected to                  
              afford insight into the nature of the reactive intermediate(s)                 
              present in each case.
