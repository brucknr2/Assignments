Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              The investigator proposes to study the industrial                              
              applicability of his ongoing research in the area of                           
              statistical quality control.  He plans to put a case for                       
              the usage of combined Shewhart cumulative score charts as                      
              a viable process control tool.  He argues that his                             
              procedures are easy to understand and that properties of                       
              these procedures are easier evaluated than the cusum type                      
              schemes.  He has shown that the combined Shewhart                              
              cumulative quality control procedure, in theory, is more                       
              sensitive to shifts in the process mean and/or                                 
              variability than both the standard Shewhart and the                            
              improved Shewhart schemes.  It has also been shown to                          
              compare favorably with the standard cusum type charts.                         
              The PI proposes to implement his procedures and compare                        
              their performance against the Shewhart and cusum type                          
              charts using real data.  He intends to identify local                          
              companies and academic institutions where these                                
              procedures can be implemented.
