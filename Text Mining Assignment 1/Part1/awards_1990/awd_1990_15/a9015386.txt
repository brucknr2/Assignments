Abstract    :
                   This research program includes tests of the Newtonian law                 
              of gravity on a laboratory distance scale, searches for new                    
              intermediate range forces at strength levels below those                       
              currently detectable, and tests of the equivalence principle                   
              which underlies the theory of general relativity.  The Irvine                  
              group plans:                                                                   
                   (1.)  An improved version of their recently conducted                     
              experiment for a composition dependence in the apparent                        
              gravitational force acting on lead and copper test masses                      
              due to a local lead attracting mass.  They expect to                           
              compare these forces to a few parts in 10 million.  (2.)                       
              Construction and operation of a rotatable torsion balance, which               
              will be used initially in the laboratory to test the equivalence               
              principle using the earth and sun as acceleration sources, and                 
              later at a mountain site with low microseismic background for an               
              improved equivalence principle test and for an ultra high                      
              sensitivity search for composition dependent forces.  (3.)  A                  
              test of the inverse square distance dependence of the                          
              gravitational force from 2mm to 2 cm.                                          
                   These experiments will provide a high-precision foundation                
              for our knowledge of the gravitational force.
