Abstract    :
                   This is a project to develop a production function which                  
              captures how technological improvements impact the work force.  The            
              impact of lead times and lags is a key innovation.  Then using                 
              optimal control, the optimal mix and expansion/contraction of these            
              elements is determined in an uncertain environment.  In a longer               
              term scenario, a model is developed to determine optimal sizing and            
              capacity of new production capacity.                                           
                   The completion of this project should give new insights into              
              the strategic planning process, and help to lead the way to                    
              improved corporate and governmental planning.
