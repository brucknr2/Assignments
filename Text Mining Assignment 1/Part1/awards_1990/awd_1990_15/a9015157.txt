Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Research into the implementation of multigrid on block-structured              
              grids will be conducted.  The major area of investigations is the              
              intergrid boundaries, common to block-structured grids.  The                   
              treatment of the boundary conditions is a crucial component in                 
              achieving efficient and accurate numerical schemes.                            
              Investigation into new ways of implementing the boundary                       
              conditions in a multigrid multiblock scheme is proposed here.                  
              Areas of investigation are data structure, interpolation and                   
              restriction operators and conservation across boundaries. The                  
              resulting new method will be implemented on shared-memory                      
              parallel computers to achieve high turn around times.
