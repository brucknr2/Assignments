Abstract    :
              The pursuit of realism in image synthesis has typically meant the              
              abandonment of efficiency.  The two most popular shading techniques,           
              ray tracing and radiosity, become quite inefficient when generalized           
              to simulate both diffuse and specular reflection.  This project                
              develops a new, unified shading algorithm that will simulate the full          
              range of reflectance phenomena without sacrificing efficiency.  The            
              approach employs a combination of radiosity and ray tracing ideas we           
              called bidirectional ray tracing.  The algorithms and data structure           
              developed should be useful for architectural design, computer-aided            
              product design, scientific visualization, motion picture special               
              effects, and improved models of image formation for computer vision.
