Abstract    :
                   The principal investigators will study the partial                        
              differential equations and integro-differential equations that                 
              model semiconductor devices by using analytical and numerical                  
              methods.  Their work will span the entire range from the actual                
              derivation of the basic equations to the solution of concrete                  
              boundary value problems.  In particular, the investigators will                
              study the Boltzmann equation and systems derived from it such as               
              the hydrodynamic model and the drift-diffusion model using                     
              asymptotic methods.                                                            
                   The systems of differential equations that describe the                   
              behavior of semiconductor devices are difficult to solve                       
              analytically.  Even large computers are unable to resolve aspects              
              of the solutions accurately.  Thus there is a great need for                   
              approximate theories that contain enough of the physics of the                 
              devices to be realistic and yet are tractable mathematically.                  
              The principal investigators will derive approximate models of                  
              semiconductors and study them with asymptotic and numerical                    
              methods, in order to understand the workings of actual devices.
