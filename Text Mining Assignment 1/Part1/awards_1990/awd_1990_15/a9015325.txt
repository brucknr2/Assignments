              Technical Narrative                                                            
                                                                                             
              This U.S.-Nigerian collaborative research project involving                    
              the University of Maryland and the University of Ilorin, Ilorin,               
              Nigeria is in the general area of climatology of atmospheric                   
              conditions.  Project funding will enable the co-investigator from              
              the University of Ilorin to work for three months time in the                  
              laboratory of Dr. Rachel Pinker at the University of Maryland.                 
              The collaborative research will analyze data used to derive                    
              information on the seasonal variation of sub-Saharan aerosol                   
              optical depths. Additionally, the co-investigator will visit the               
              NOAA Environmental Research Laboratories in Boulder, Colorado in               
              order to become acquainted with the World Climate Research                     
              Program plans to establish global baseline radiation networks for              
              monitoring global climate change, and for validating satellite                 
              retrieval methods.                                                             
                                                                                             
              This project in aerosol climatology fulfills the program                       
              objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling                        
              leading experts in the United States and Nigeria to combine                    
              complementary talents and pool research resources in areas                     
              of strong mutual interest and competence.
