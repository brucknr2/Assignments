Abstract    :
              The research proposed is concerned with probabilistic concepts arising         
              in the theory of computation on the one hand, and its effect on the            
              understanding of the nature of randomness on the other.  The theory of         
              problems with intractable random instances is more subtle than similar         
              worst-case theories.  Constructive expanders, coding theory, and other         
              combinatorial and algebraic techniques must be used.  An important use         
              of hard-on-average problems is the generation of pseudo-random                 
              strings.  In contrast, worst-case negative results rarely have                 
              applications, while worst-case positive results are hopeless for many          
              easy-on average problems.
