Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Dr. Schechter will obtain observations of Cepheid variable stars               
              and carbon stars to determine the shape of the potential of our                
              Galaxy.  In both cases photometry will yield distances to the stars            
              while spectroscopy will yield velocities.  The data from the                   
              Cepheids will also be used to determine the distance from the Sun              
              to the center of our Galaxy.                                                   
                                                                                             
              It has proven difficult to determine the relative contributions of             
              a disk, a bulge, and dark matter to the total masses of galaxies.              
              A better understanding of the relative importance of dark and                  
              luminous matter in a galaxy is a prerequisite to understanding how             
              galaxies form and evolve.  In the Milky Way galaxy one can measure             
              all three components of position and velocity for specific tracers             
              of mass.  Our knowledge of the mass distribution in our Galaxy can             
              then be applied to understanding the structure of other galaxies.              
              Dr. Schechter's research addresses two of the fundamental problems             
              in galactic structure -- the degree to which orbits are non-                   
              circular at the distance of the Sun in our Galaxy and the distance             
              of the Sun to the center of our Galaxy.
