Abstract    :
              Working with Dr. David Blair at the University of Western                      
              Australia and Dr. Rolf Koch, from the Curtin University of                     
              Technology, both in Perth, Western Australia, Drs. Carl                        
              Pennypacker and Richard Muller, along with two graduate students,              
              all of the University of California at Berkeley, will implement a              
              search for supernovae in the Southern Hemisphere from the Perth                
              Observatory.  Software developed for the Berkeley "Automated                   
              Supernova Search," a highly successful NSF-funded project, will                
              be transferred to the Perth Observatory so that a similar program              
              can be established there.                                                      
                                                                                             
              The search will utilize Perth's 24" telescope, a CCD system                    
              currently under development, and a computer system similar to the              
              one in Berkeley.  When the Perth system starts to function, there              
              will be some overlap in the galaxies searched, such that when                  
              Berkeley discovers a new supernova, Perth can confirm, and vice                
              versa.  Similarly, when inclement weather prevents observations                
              at one observatory, the other can take over.  As confidence is                 
              gained in the new system at Perth, it can begin searches in                    
              galaxies visible only from the Southern Hemisphere, and                        
              discoveries can be shared and studied jointly.
