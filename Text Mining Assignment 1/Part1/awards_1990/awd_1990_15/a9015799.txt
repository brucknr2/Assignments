Abstract    :
              This award supports cooperative research in field theory                       
              between Dr. Henrik Aratyn of the University of Illinois at                     
              Chicago and Dr. A. H. Zimerman of the Sao Paulo State                          
              University (UNESP) in Sao Paulo, Brazil.  Important progress                   
              in modern field theory is presently being achieved in the                      
              case of models possessing huge amounts of symmetry.  These                     
              models are important for understanding two-dimensional                         
              effective gravity as well as related issues of off-critical                    
              string theory and conformal field theories.                                    
                                                                                             
              New advances in understanding of such models seems to require                  
              application of geometrical methods to investigate models                       
              with infinite dimensional symmetry groups.  The method is                      
              based on a fundamental geometrical idea that the orbits                        
              associated to the symmetry groups constitute a physically                      
              relevant phase space.  In this framework the investigators                     
              will study several models which possess the infinite                           
              dimensional gauge groups and analyze the consequences of                       
              these huge degrees of symmetries in the quantum mechanical                     
              setting.  The main part of the work will be performed during                   
              mutual visits to the University of Illinois at Chicago and to                  
              the Instituto de Fisica Teorica-UNESP, Sao Paulo, Brazil.
