              Abstract                                                                        
                  This work is intended to complement and provide a                         
              theoretical basis for interpretation of flare and flare-related                
              phenomena during the current solar maximum.  The two primary                   
              processes to be investigated are (1) the mechanism responsible                 
              for initiating and driving the coronal mass ejection, the solar                
              flare and associated  phenomena, and (2) magnetic reconnection                 
              and its potential role in energy conversion, heating and particle              
              acceleration.  Numerical modelling forms the core of the                       
              theoretical approach to be used in studying these topics,                      
              although some analytical studies will be used for the second                   
              topic.  A primary objective will be to relate the results to                   
              observations.  In particular, the first study will be directly                 
              compared to observations from white light coronagraphs, as well                
              as to x-ray and H alpha data. The second study has application to              
              x-ray, EUV, and H alpha data and to observations with particle                 
              detectors.   ***
