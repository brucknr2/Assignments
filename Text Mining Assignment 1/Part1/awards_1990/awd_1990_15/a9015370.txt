Abstract    :
              Professor Sidney W. Benson is supported by a grant from the                    
              Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to study the                   
              thermodynamics and kinetics of atom-radical and radical-radical                
              reactions.  The results of this research should provide                        
              important input for modeling hydrocarbon combustion and                        
              atmospheric chemistry.                                                         
                                                                                             
              Benson will employ the Very Low Pressure Reactor (VLPR)                        
              technique to invistigate the kinetics of the reaction of alkyl                 
              radicals with oxygen over a wide range of temperatures.                        
              Sufficient data will be collected on these reactions to                        
              distinguish between an addition mechanism and a metathesis                     
              mechanism.  In addition the kinetics of atom-radical reactions                 
              involving halocarbenes will be studied.  These halocarbenes are                
              formed in various radical reactions involving atomic chlorine                  
              with halogenated hydrocarbon free radicals.
