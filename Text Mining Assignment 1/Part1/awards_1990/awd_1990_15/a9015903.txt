Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research addresses the relationship between surface                       
              geology, as described in geological maps, with the                             
              earthquake strong ground motions recorded at a site.  The                      
              motivation is to make more precise the general observation                     
              that structures built on rock sites experience the least                       
              damage and those on soft soil the greatest damage during an                    
              earthquake.  The aim is to address a scale which falls                         
              between "macrozonation" - seismic regionalization - and                        
              "microzonation", that is, site specific intensity modification.                
                                                                                             
              The Whittier Narrows earthquake of October 1, 1987 and                         
              the Loma Prieta earthquake of October 17, 1989 produced                        
              the largest suite of strong ground motion records                              
              (accelerograms) ever taken in just two events.  In addition,                   
              many accelerograms have been recorded on a variety of soil                     
              and rock conditions during other earthquakes.  This study                      
              examines this extensive data library to correlate the intensity                
              characteristics of each instrument site with characteristics of                
              surface geology, as described on surface geology maps.                         
                                                                                             
              This correlation has application in determining priorities for                 
              the rehabilitation of structures, in land use planning, and in                 
              determining probable maximum loss estimates prepared for                       
              insurers, bankers and business.
