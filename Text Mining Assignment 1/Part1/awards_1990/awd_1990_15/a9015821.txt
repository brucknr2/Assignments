Abstract    :
                   This research is concerned with the theory of quantum                     
              groups.  The theory of quasitriangualar Hopf Algebras,                         
              particularly calculations of certain invariants of 3-                          
              manifolds derived from finite dimensional Hopf algebras                        
              and conformal field theory, provides the focus for the                         
              project.                                                                       
                   Quantum groups are a new area of research for both                        
              mathematicians and physicists.  On the mathematical side                       
              it combines three of the oldest areas of "pure" mathematics,                   
              algebra, analysis and geometry, yet it is of great interest                    
              to physicists working in conformal quantum field theory.
