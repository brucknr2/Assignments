Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              This project supports a workshop on an introduction to the Cornell             
              National Supercomputing Facility (CNSF) and to parallel processing             
              and vectorization.  The CNSF is an NSF supported supercomputer                 
              center providing access,education, training and consulting to                  
              academic researchers.  Attendees at the workshop will be                       
              engineering faculty members from eight Historically Black Colleges             
              and Universities (HBCU's).  CNSF will work closely with these                  
              institutions and their faculty on the many aspects of                          
              supercomputing.  This project is aimed at encouraging minority                 
              institution and researchers to expand the scope of their research              
              problems by utilizing the advanced computation capabilities of the             
              center in the areas of vector and parallel processing, access to               
              large address space and extensive visualization tools such as video            
              animation.  The participants will also have an opportunity to meet             
              with other researchers.  Each participant will receive an initial              
              allocation of 10 service units for use in their research program.
