Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research is focused on developing a general lubrication                   
              theory based on the principles of modern continuum mechanics that              
              could account for the existence of both solid particulates and                 
              fluid additives in the lubricant.  Specifically, the theoretical               
              development shall be based on the balance laws of the interacting              
              contua known as the mixture theory.  The governing equations and               
              appropriate boundary conditions are to be derived.  It is                      
              proposed to apply the theory to predict realistic performance                  
              characteristics of various multiphase lubricants in the most                   
              common types of mechanical components such as the hydrodynamic                 
              slider and journal bearings.  The governing equations are to be                
              solved numerically on the CRAY Supercomputer at the Pittsburgh                 
              Supercomputing Center.  Result shall be presented in                           
              dimensionless form useful to the designer.  Based on the                       
              findings, recommendations shall be made for the development of                 
              alternative lubricants that can perform under severe operating                 
              conditions.
