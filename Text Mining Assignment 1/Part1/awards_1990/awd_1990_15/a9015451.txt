Abstract    :
              This grant is to support research in theoretical astrophysics by               
              one of the leading and most productive research groups in the                  
              world.  Studies will range from the generation of gravitational                
              waves by neutron star systems to the dynamical evolution of                    
              globular clusters and galactic nuclei to the dynamics of                       
              superclusters of groups of galaxies.  Both snslytical studies and              
              numerical modeling on supercomputers will be used to extend our                
              understanding of the dynamics and evolution of complex systems.
