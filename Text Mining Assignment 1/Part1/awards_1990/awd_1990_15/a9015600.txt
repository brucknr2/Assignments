Abstract    :
              The research, in the general area of Analytical and Surface                    
              Chemistry, focuses on surface chemistry.  The work promises to                 
              lead to an understanding of the mechanisms by which the energy                 
              of a photon or electron is converted to electronic excitation                  
              that leads to bond breaking whithin chemical species attached                  
              to a metal surface.  Such experiments improve our understanding                
              of surface chemistry which can lead to better catalysts and                    
              thus cheaper and better chemical products.                                     
                                                                                             
              Metals such as platinum and silver will be used as substrates                  
              and alkyl halides used as model systems for species attached to                
              these substrates.  Photon-induced reactions among coadsorbed                   
              species (such as oxygen and ethylene) will be examined, as will                
              the effect of laser-induced desorption of chemisorbed species                  
              on the metal surface.
