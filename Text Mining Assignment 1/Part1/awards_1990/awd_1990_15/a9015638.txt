Abstract    :
                   Quantized Geometry comprises three closely interconnected                 
              areas:  (1)  The Zeta functions of elliptic operators, which in                
              topology and geometry are used to describe non-local numerical                 
              invariants like torsion, and in physics are related to functional              
              integrals.  (2)  The geometry of certain infinite dimensional                  
              spaces and groups, which have appeared in algebraic topology in                
              connection with the algebraic K-theory of topological spaces, in               
              geometric topology in connection with the groups of automorphisms              
              of manifolds, and in physics as mathematical models capable of                 
              incorporating new types of symmetry, like supersymmetry.                       
              (3)  Operator algebraic methods which, with the advent of K-                   
              theory, became relevant to differential and topological geometry.              
                   This grant will enable a number of junior mathematicians to               
              participate in a conference devoted to Quantized Geometry at the               
              Ohio State University in May, 1991.
