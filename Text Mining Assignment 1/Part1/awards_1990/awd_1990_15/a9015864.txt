Abstract    :
              This research is a collaborative effort between an experimental NMR            
              research group and a theoretical chemistry research group to                   
              investigate the dynamics of glassy polymers.  The experimental                 
              group will combine existing techniques of modern solids NMR with               
              new experiments (rotational-echo, double-resonance C-13--F-19 NMR              
              and rotational-echo dephasing H-1 NMR) to investigate the dynamics             
              of 180o flips of the main-chain phenyl rings in polycarbonates and             
              polycarbonate-like plastics.  These systems will be investigated               
              under a variety of physical conditions including high external                 
              hydrostatic pressure.  Chains will be examined in bulk and at                  
              polymer-polymer interfaces.  Phenyl ring flips are of interest                 
              because they monitor the slow density fluctuations of the solid,               
              which are related to physical properties such as toughness.  To                
              understand these density fluctuations in detail, a parallel set of             
              computational experiments using a Generalized Langevin Dynamics                
              simulation technique will be undertaken.  This method of computer              
              simulation has been specifically developed to allow the simulation             
              of slow motions in a glassy solid.
