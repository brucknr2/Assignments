Abstract    :
              The research objective of this project is to develop a                         
              body of knowledge in methodology and analytical tools                          
              for estimating the synchronous machine stability                               
              parameters from the standpoint of system identification.                       
              Furthermore, the significance of the research is that                          
              synchronous machine manufacturers can use the                                  
              technique proposed here to independently validate their                        
              proprietary design model during design and factory                             
              testing.  Power system engineers at utility companies can                      
              use the estimation procedure to identify the machine                           
              parameters for stability studies, using the operating data.                    
              Furthermore, the power system engineers can use the                            
              validated machine models to correctly predict the                              
              developing stability problems of America's bulk power                          
              transmission systems.  Finally, power system control                           
              engineers can use the identified machine models to                             
              accurately predict the dynamic performance of                                  
              electronically controlled future power systems.
