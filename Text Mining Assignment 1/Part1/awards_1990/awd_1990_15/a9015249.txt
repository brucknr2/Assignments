Abstract    :
                   The ever expanding role of window based human-computer                    
              interfaces, while leading to dramatic improvements for users                   
              with normal vision, is in fact detrimental, and often highly                   
              so, to the millions of users who are visually impaired but not                 
              blind.  Indeed, current trends threaten to widen rather than                   
              close the gap between normal and visually impaired users, to                   
              the extend that the latter group may soon literally find                       
              themselves locked out of the community of users almost                         
              entirely.  The goal in this research is to prevent this from                   
              happening, by developing concepts and implementing a prototype                 
              for an alternative to the window-based interfaces of today                     
              which will allow the visually handicapped to become first-class                
              computer users.
