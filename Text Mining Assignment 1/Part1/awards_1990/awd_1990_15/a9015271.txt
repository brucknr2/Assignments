Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is on estimation and signal processing              
              of multidimensional data.  The work involves two main areas of                 
              research.  The first deals with the development of multiscale                  
              models and estimation methods for Markov random fields (MRF) and               
              their application to problems in image processing such as                      
              segmentation, edge detection and coding.  The goal of this effort              
              is to develop multiresolution techniques for MRF's which extend the            
              wavelet methods introduced recently for the multiscale                         
              representation of deterministic signals.  The second part of the               
              research focusses on the development of efficient multigrid and                
              domain decomposition methods for the solution of multidimensional              
              estimation problems, and for inverse problems or impedance imaging.            
              This work is part of a collaborative research effort with a group              
              at MIT led by Professor Alan Willsky.
