Abstract    :
              This award will support collaborative research between Dr.                     
              Gifford Miller of the University of Colorado at Boulder and                    
              Dr. Allan R. Chivas of the Australian National University.                     
              The research is to apply to ostrich eggshells a new and                        
              highly successful varient of the dating technique, amino acid                  
              racemization, that is, investigation of protein changes from                   
              active to inactive materials. The technique can only be used                   
              when there is no loss of these materials from internal to                      
              external environments; the great density of ostrich eggshells                  
              protects such loss in this research. Highly reproducible                       
              dates on the timing and patterns of the migration of hominids                  
              across Asia and into Australia, and information on climatic                    
              changes over relatively short periods of geological time will                  
              result from this research. As racemization can be applied to                   
              materials which are too old to be dated by radiocarbon                         
              dating, the project provides a unique opportunity to date                      
              activities in the 35,000 and older time range.                                 
                                                                                             
              The project represents excellent collaboration between the                     
              Australian and U.S. researchers. The Australian group will                     
              contribute expertise in isolating individual amino acids from                  
              fossils, excellent laboratory facilities, and field support                    
              for collecting samples. Dr. Miller will contribute his                         
              already-extensive expertise in the technique of amino acid                     
              racemization for dating. This is clearly important work of                     
              benefit to both the Australian and U.S. scientific communities                 
              on dating the ages of human migration and associated climate                   
              change.
