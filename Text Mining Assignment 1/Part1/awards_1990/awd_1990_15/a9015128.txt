Abstract    :
                   The Engineering Research Center for Optoelectronic Computing              
              Systems, in its third year of NSF funding, has developed a                     
              research and education program focused on three types of                       
              optoelectronic systems for numerical digital computing, signal                 
              processing, and neural-like information processing, with a broad               
              supporting base of research in optoelectronic materials and                    
              devices.  Educational impact has been great on both campuses,                  
              including new and updated courses, and a program of research                   
              experiences for undergraduates which includes opportunities for                
              students from other institutions.  Industry support and                        
              participation is strong, and considerable technology transfer has              
              been accomplished.  A number of inventions have been made, and                 
              several patents have been received.  This action is for a                      
              five-year renewal of funding, with the first year to be at the                 
              base level of $2.4 million and increases in future years to be                 
              commensurate with further progress and funds available to the                  
              Engineering Research Centers Program.  The research in the coming              
              five-years will proceed in the directions originally set.                      
                   This award also, is to fund the Center's Research                         
              Experiences for Undergraduates outreach program, and will support              
              five undergraduates from other institutions in the current year.
