Abstract    :
              Our understanding of stellar evolution hinges to a large extent on             
              our ability to interpret the spectra of cool stars.  The Principal             
              and Co- Investigators (PI's) plan to continue a long-term program              
              of laboratory measurements of the emission spectra of molecules of             
              astrophysical interests.  The PI's measurements will determine                 
              wavelengths, level structure, excitation energies, and transition              
              probabilities from measurements made with an electric furnace                  
              mounted in the beam of the Fourier Transform Spectrometer at the               
              McMath Solar Telescope on Kitt Peak.  These data will be                       
              transformed to spectral atlases for use in molecular identification            
              and molecular synthesis by astronomers interested in determining               
              the physical conditions (including chemical composition) of the                
              atmospheres of cool stars.
