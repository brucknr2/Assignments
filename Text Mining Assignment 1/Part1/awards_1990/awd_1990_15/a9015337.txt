Abstract    :
              In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the                       
              Chemistry Division, calculations will be performed to help                     
              increase the understanding of electron interactions within                     
              atoms and molecules.  As a result of this work it will be                      
              possible to calculate certain physical properties of atoms and                 
              molecules, such as bond dissociation energies or electronic                    
              spectra.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              Quantum Monte Carlo techniques will be used to compute the                     
              ground state energies of molecules and heavy atoms and to study                
              the reaction between molecular hydrogen and fluorine atom.  The                
              proposed techniques include both the Green's function and                      
              variational Monte Carlo approaches and are expected to yield                   
              highly accurate treatments of the electron correlation effects                 
              in these systems.  Of particular interest is the inclusion of                  
              backflow correlations which enables local current conservation                 
              conditions to be satisfied.
