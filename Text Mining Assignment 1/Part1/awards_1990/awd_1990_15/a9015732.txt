Abstract    :
              A research program will be conducted to investigate the                        
              chemical mechanism for NO removal in combustion products by                    
              cyanuric acid.  Information about the kinetic parameters and                   
              products of several critical gas-phase reactions, viz NCO +                    
              NO, O2 and O, will be obtained in a series of shock tube                       
              experiments using laser-based diagnostics.  The kinetic data                   
              in the temperature range of 2000 to 3000 K will be                             
              incorporated into a detailed chemical model which can be used                  
              to investigate ways to improve process performance.                            
                                                                                             
              The injection of crystalline cyanuric acid particles into hot                  
              combustion products to initiate a reaction sequence which can                  
              remove in excess of 80% of the NO in the exhaust is currently                  
              under development for application to stationary combustion                     
              sources.  It appears to be an economically attractive                          
              alternative to current exhaust gas treatment methods such as                   
              selective catalytic reduction, thermal de-NOx, and urea                        
              injection.
