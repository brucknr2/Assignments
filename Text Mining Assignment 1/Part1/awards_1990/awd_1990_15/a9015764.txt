Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal requests partial support for a Gordon Conference on              
              the topic of "Enzyme Organization and Cell Function."  The                     
              conference has been held twice previously in 1987 and 1989 with                
              great success.  Monies requested will be used to support the travel            
              and subsistence of participants.                                               
                                                                                             
              The topic of the conference deals with a most important topic: how             
              do the structure and organization of enzymes in living cells affect            
              their function.  Some important areas to be covered include the                
              formation of multienzyme complexes, direct transfer of metabolic               
              intermediates, the effect of intracellular conditions on enzyme                
              activity, theoretical and experimental approaches to enzyme                    
              regulation, as well as the transport, maturation and processing of             
              proteins.***  //
