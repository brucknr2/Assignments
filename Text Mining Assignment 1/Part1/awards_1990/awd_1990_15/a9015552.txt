Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              This project supports the development and application of a general             
              interdisciplinary undergraduate course in advanced computing that can          
              be adopted at many colleges and universities.  The principal                   
              investigator, Dr. Dan Sulzbach, is a staff member at the San Diego             
              State University.  The course will be developed by Dr. Sulzbach and            
              Dr. Kris Stewart, a faculty member at San Diego State University and           
              first utilized at San Diego State University which is a member of the          
              twenty campus California State University system (CSU).  After                 
              testing at SDSC the course will be distributed to the other CSU                
              campuses via a one-week workshop.  In 1992 a workshop for faculty              
              from U.S. colleges and universities and a symposium at SIAM will be            
              held to foster the distribution of the course in other institutions.
