Abstract    :
              This is an award to provide renewed support for completion                     
              of a project initiated under NSF Grant No. 88-07774 to                         
              investigate a novel concept for decontamination of water                       
              that contains organic pollutants.  Prior work had                              
              indicated that in the presence of polyethylene oxide,                          
              decomposition products of irradiation were scavenged from                      
              solution suggesting that free radical species formed                           
              during irradiation were coupled to radical sites formed on                     
              the polymer.  The work to be conducted will concentrate on                     
              the dose-rate effect of electron beam radiation to                             
              determine whether the observed coupling of free radicals                       
              formed during radiation is proportional to their                               
              concentration which in turn is proportional to dose-rate.                      
              The investigator plans to modify the electron-beam                             
              accelerator used in prior work to allow a ten-fold                             
              increase in dose rate and plans to use a pulsed linear                         
              accelerator made available for his use in MIT's Plasma                         
              Fusion Laboratory to achieve dose rates several orders of                      
              magnitude larger than possible by use of the Van de Graaff                     
              accelerator previously used in his research.                                   
                                                                                             
              The presence of organic contaminants in water is a problem                     
              of considerable significance as it relates to usefulness                       
              of water for municipal and industrial purposes.  This                          
              research on a method for destruction of these contaminants                     
              by use of ionizing radiation is expected to provide                            
              guidance for its potential use in engineering design of                        
              processes and systems to decontaminate water and                               
              wastewater.
