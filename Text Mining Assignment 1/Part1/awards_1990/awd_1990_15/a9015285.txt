Abstract    :
                   This proposal is to take measurements of the upper ocean                  
              velocity field using an acoustic doppler current profiler (ADCP)               
              mounted in the hull of the research vessel.  The work will be                  
              done as a contribution to the World Ocean Circulation Experiment               
              (WOCE) on the hydrographic cruises in the southeastern Pacific.                
              In addition the PI will test a lowered ADCP system which should                
              be of great utility in measuring currents a depth, particularly                
              in the low latitudes.
