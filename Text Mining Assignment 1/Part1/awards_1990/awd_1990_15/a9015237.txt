Abstract    :
                   The purpose of this conference is to provide a forum for an               
              exchange of ideas between researchers in the Division of Design                
              and Manufacturing Systems to assure that these individual                      
              researchers are informed about the present ongoing activities of               
              their colleagues.  Thus an elimination of duplication of their                 
              efforts may be achieved and a degree of cooperation may result.                
              An overall improvement of efficiency of the Division would be                  
              expected.  In addition, the conference program organization allows             
              for ample time to discuss manufacturing research in detail with the            
              collective research community at the meeting with feedback and                 
              input from the National Science Foundation.  Finally, personal                 
              contacts with researchers in the Division should contribute to                 
              clarifying many current problems in their work.  Principal                     
              Investigator's will have one to two years advanced information as              
              it often takes that much time between the report of the work                   
              presented at the grantees conference and the publication of papers             
              about this work in the literature.
