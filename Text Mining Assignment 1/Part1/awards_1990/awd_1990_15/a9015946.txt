Abstract    :
              The objective of this research is to                                           
              design, fabricate and characterize                                             
              highly resonant electron wave guide                                            
              structures.  The semiconductor                                                 
              structures will be fabricated using                                            
              high mobility GaAs/A1GaAs                                                      
              heterostructures.  Device design                                               
              will be similar to that of HEMT                                                
              devices except a gate structure will                                           
              confirm the two-dimensional electron                                           
              gas between the source and the drain                                           
              to one-dimension.  The region of                                               
              confinement will be shaped in a                                                
              manner analogous to adding tuning                                              
              stubs and cavities to a conventional                                           
              wave guide system.  We will examine                                            
              the transmission coefficients and                                              
              transconductance of the device as a                                            
              function of gate bias, source-drain                                            
              bias, temperature and applied                                                  
              magnetic field.
