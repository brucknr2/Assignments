Abstract    :
              The aim of this renewal proposal is to study the electronic and                
              geometric structure of ordered and defect-ridden transition metal              
              oxide surfaces, and the rich chemistry which they exhibit.  A wide             
              range of surface sensitive electron spectroscopic techniques,                  
              including ultraviolet- and xrayphotoelectron spectroscopy, auger               
              and high-resolution electron-energy-loss spectroscopy will be used.
