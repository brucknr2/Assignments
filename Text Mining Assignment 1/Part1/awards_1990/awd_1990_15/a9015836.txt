Abstract    :
              This award will support collaborative research between Dr.                     
              Alexander Meyerovich, University of Rhode Island, and                          
              Professor F. Laloe, Laboratoire de Spectroscopie Hertzienne,                   
              Ecole Normale Superieure, Paris, France. The objective of the                  
              project is to provide a reliable general kinetic description                   
              of coherent transverse effects in spin-polarized quantum                       
              systems and systems of particles with other internal degrees                   
              of freedom.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              The investigators plan to l) work on a derivation of a                         
              reliable low-temperature equation for polarized systems, 2)                    
              re-derive the analogous equation for low-temperature and                       
              degenerate polarized ensembles, 3) generalize the results                      
              obtained thus far to include systems with arbitrary non-                       
              Abelian internal degrees of freedom, and 4) investigate                        
              relevant applications.  Dr. Meyerovich and Laloe are both                      
              internationally known for their work in spin-polarized                         
              quantum systems, and this project will benefit from their                      
              complementary expertise.  The results of this research will                    
              be applicable to ultra-cold atomic and molecular beams and                     
              ensembles, multi-state solid-state quasi-particles and to                      
              spin dynamics in ultra-low temperature spin-polarized quantum                  
              systems.
