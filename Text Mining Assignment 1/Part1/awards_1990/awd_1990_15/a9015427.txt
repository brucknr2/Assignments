Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The long-range objective of this research program is to                        
              develop methods for the correlation and prediction of the                      
              equilibrium thermodynamic behavior of pure polymers and                        
              polymer-solvent solutions.  This is to include effects of                      
              pressure and temperature on density, vapor-liquid and liquid                   
              equilibria, and systems containing multiple solvents and/or                    
              polymers.  In order to achieve this goal, extensive and                        
              reliable data are needed for the model developments.  Data                     
              bases are being assembled containing evaluated literature data                 
              for the various types of systems.  In order to pursue the                      
              development of a dependable group contribution model, more                     
              accurate data will be collected.  The laboratory established                   
              under a previous NSF equipment grant is used for this purpose.                 
              A new group contribution model is being developed based on a                   
              lattice-fluid model of the polymer-solvent systems.  The                       
              program is being coordinated with a complementary effort at                    
              the Technical University of Denmark.
