Abstract    :
              Doubt remains concerning the age and nature of Late Cenozoic                   
              marine and glacial deposits along the coast of the Chukchi                     
              Peninsula, Siberia, and the correlation of these deposits                      
              with the Late Cenozoic sequence on nearby Alaskan coasts.  A                   
              better understanding of the Chukotkan sequence is especially                   
              needed in the light of recent confirmation that western St.                    
              Lawrence Island was over-run by large glaciers that                            
              originated in the mountainous Chukchi Peninsula.  Adding                       
              interest is the fact that glaciomarine deposits of middle                      
              Pleistocene age are reported to be widespread on the Chukchi                   
              coast.  This award addresses these questions in a joint                        
              study with Soviet researchers intended to establish a new                      
              stratigraphic and geochronologic framework for regional late                   
              Cenozoic correlations.  Special attention will be given to                     
              the paleoclimate significance of the remarkable mid-                           
              Pleistocene event that evidently resulted in out-of-phase                      
              glaciation throughout central Beringia.  This project is                       
              proposed as a part of the  program for U.S. - U.S.S.R.                         
              Cooperation in the Field of Basic Research.
