Abstract    :
              This U.S.-Italy award will support an international school--a                  
              combined workshop and seminar meeting--covering recent advances                
              in the understanding of static, kinematic and dynamic aspects                  
              of crystal and molecular structure, as studied by crystal                      
              diffraction, spectroscopic and theoretical methods.  The school                
              is being held at the Ettore Majorana Centre for Scientific                     
              Culture in Erice, Sicily, from May 30 to June 9, 1991 and is                   
              being organized by Professor Kenneth Trueblood of UCLA for the                 
              U.S. side and Professor Lodovico Riva di Sanseverino of the                    
              University of Bologna for Italy.  About 120 participants from a                
              dozen or more countries are expected, the great majority of                    
              whom will be young faculty members or others who have recently                 
              received advanced degrees.  There will be about 20 lectures                    
              and 10 tutors to help in workshops and microsymposia.                          
                                                                                             
              During the last two decades, the amount of precise and accurate                
              information about molecular structure has increased enormously.                
              Much of this is the result of increased automation and precision               
              of data collection and analysis in crystal diffraction, but                    
              there have also been important advances in other experimental                  
              techniques for studying structure.  In addition, theory has                    
              progressed to a stage where some of the details of molecular                   
              structure can be predicted at a level comparable with that                     
              attained by experiment.  There have also been advances in the                  
              analysis of the kinematics and dynamics of molecules in                        
              crystals, as well as in their correlation with phase transforma-               
              tions and solid state reactions.  The present school intends                   
              to review past achievements, present projects, and future goals                
              in the realm of crystal and molecular structure studies by                     
              diffraction and spectroscopic methods.  Particular emphasis                    
              will be placed on the description and understanding of atomic                  
              motion in molecules and in crystals, with relevance to physical                
              properties, chemical reactivity, and phase transformations,                    
              including such topics as structure-correlation (using statistical              
              methods with the Cambridge Structural Database), polymorphism,                 
              and solid-state reactions.
