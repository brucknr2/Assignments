Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Interface states at grain boundaries in wide band gap materials                
              such as zinc oxide are being studied by means of deep level                    
              transient spectroscopy and a new transient photocapacitance                    
              technique being developed as part of the project.  The goals are               
              to identify the origins of deep states greater than 1eV below the              
              conduction band, and to uncover the physical origins of emission               
              of trapped carriers from the deep levels.
