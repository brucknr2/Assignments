Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A new technique for measuring stellar distances using Oxygen lines             
              in F type supergiants is being developed by Professor Deane                    
              Peterson of the State University of New York at Stony Brook.  This             
              award funds research to test the new method on objects in M33, a               
              member of our local group of galaxies.  If successful, the new                 
              technique promises an independent way to determine distances to                
              more distant galaxies, improving our knowledge of the value of the             
              Hubble constant and the age of the universe.
