Abstract    :
              The attenuation of 'third sound' in superfluid helium films, 4 to              
              20 layers thick, will be studied over the range 30mK to 300mK.  In             
              particular, one hopes to illuminate the role of pinned vortices in             
              the damping and, ultimately, develop third-sound attenuation as a              
              reliable probe for many new low-temperature systems.
