Abstract    :
                   The goal of this project is to support the adoption and use of            
              X.400 in the Internet through the following activities:                        
                 1. Continuation and expansion of experiments involving use of               
                    1984 X.400 on the Internet.  At the time of award, initial               
                    work in this area had been started at Wisconsin with funding             
                    from NASA.                                                               
                 2. Leadership in introducing X.400 into the Internet and liaison            
                    with relevant groups including the NIST Implementors Group,              
                    the RARE Working Group 1 (X.400), commercial X.400 providers             
                    (in cooperation with the Center for National Research                    
                    Initiatives), the Interagency Activities Board and the                   
                    Federal Networking Council.                                              
                 3. Planning an Internet PRMD (Private Management Domain) whose              
                    functions would include:  management of Internet X.400                   
                    activities; liaison to government agencies, standards bodies,            
                    academic/research networks, commercial organizations and                 
                    groups in other countries involved with X.400; technical                 
                    support functions for the X.400 user community; and planning             
                    for the evolution of services.                                           
                 4. Incorporation of X.400 technical innovations into the X.400              
                    experiments including migration to 1988 X.400, multimedia                
                    extensions, use of directory services, use of X.400 over ISO             
                    TP4/CLNP and security extensions.
