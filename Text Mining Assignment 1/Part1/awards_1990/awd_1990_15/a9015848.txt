Abstract    :
                   This is a pilot research project to evaluate the natural                  
              variability of monthly precipitation and use these estimates to                
              1) evaluate General Circulation Model (GCM) simulations of                     
              present-day precipitation variability and 2) determine whether                 
              and where GCM-forecasts of terrestrial precipitation changes                   
              under doubled Carbon Dioxide scenarios will be first detected.                 
              This assessment will be obtained by compiling a pilot data base                
              of monthly precipitation totals from terrestrial stations and                  
              removing "gage-induced" biases (including the effect of the wind,              
              wetting on the interior walls of the gage, and evaporation form                
              the gage) by an empirically-based method.  As surface air                      
              temperature, wind speed, and humidity are required to facilitate               
              the gage corrections, the database also will contain observations              
              of these climatological variables.  Missing observations of both               
              air temperature and wind speed will be interpolated both                       
              spatially and temporally.  Digital filtering procedures then will              
              be used to obtain areally-averaged estimates of precipitation                  
              that are compatible with the GCM resolutions.  The natural                     
              variability in monthly precipitation will be computed and used                 
              to calculate signal-to-noise and compared with a number of                     
              general circulation models.  These results then will be used to                
              determine where (if anywhere) Carbon Dioxide-induced changes in                
              precipitation will be detectable and consequently, important.
