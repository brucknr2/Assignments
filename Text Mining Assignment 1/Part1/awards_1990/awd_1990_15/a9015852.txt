Abstract    :
                This research is to extend previous advances in full-wave                    
              elastic inversion of seismic array data at pre-critical                        
              reflections to the post-critical reflection case at wide                       
              apertures.  Wide-aperture data has large amplitude and phase                   
              changes associated with post-critical reflections.  The inversion              
              process will yield information on P-wave and S-wave velocities                 
              and on density in crustal and upper mantle seismic reflection                  
              studies.
