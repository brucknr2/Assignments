Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is an equipment grant to upgrade and                                      
              improve the capability of the earthquake                                       
              simulator (shaking table) facility at the                                      
              Earthquake Engineering Research Center of the                                  
              University of California at Berkeley.  The 20                                  
              ft. x 20 ft. shaking table that was completed,                                 
              and began its operation, in 1972 is still one                                  
              of the largest in the United States.  This                                     
              facility has been in use virtually                                             
              continuously since its construction for                                        
              research performed by faculty members at                                       
              Berkeley and at other universities throughout                                  
              the U.S. and the world, by engineers from                                      
              consulting firms, and for services to                                          
              industry, corporations and government                                          
              agencies.  Although the shaking table                                          
              continues to be used, by 1985 it became                                        
              evident that the facility was in serious need                                  
              of renovation.  In 1986 the State of                                           
              California and the National Science Foundation                                 
              allocated funds for the renovation of this                                     
              facility as well as to explore the possibility                                 
              of adding the missing third transnational                                      
              component of motion to the table.  Most of the                                 
              renovation and improvement work contemplated                                   
              in these allocations has been completed.                                       
                                                                                             
              In recognition of the importance of                                            
              implementing simultaneous capability for the                                   
              table in the three transnational components                                    
              that a seismic ground motion can have, the                                     
              University of California at Berkeley has                                       
              allocated additional funds for the design,                                     
              construction and installation of the                                           
              modifications necessary to increase the                                        
              existing electrical power.  This action will                                   
              provide support for the necessary upgrading of                                 
              the present hydraulic fluid capacity to about                                  
              twice the current capacity.  The addition of                                   
              the third transnational component will permit                                  
              conducting integrated analytical and                                           
              experimental research on the response of                                       
              three-dimensional test structures to multi-                                    
              directional excitations.                                                       
                                                                                             
              This project will elevate the nation's                                         
              earthquake engineering experimental research
