Abstract    :
                   The research will review the gaging process at a roller                   
              bearing company and modernize its gaging strategies in an optimal              
              manner.  The analysis will account for the use of state-of-the-art             
              technologies, theories and philosophies.  Several areas will be                
              addressed in this study including design, inspection, production               
              capability, proper maintenance and training, as well as the                    
              enhancement of current standards to enable improved quality                    
              assurance.  The resulting production system should demonstrate                 
              increased efficiency and an improved capability.  The results from             
              this project may be further applied to several other bearing lines;            
              and eventually to a wide variety of manufacturing processes.
