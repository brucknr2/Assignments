Abstract    :
                   The Early Cambrian metazoan radiation involved a period of                
              lower metazoan evolution coupled with a relatively abrupt                      
              diversification of body types, many now extinct, during the                    
              Cambrian.  This history implies a sequence of changes in genetic               
              control or morphological pattern formation to encode the sequence              
              of novel architectures.  This project will investigate the                     
              relations between (1) the indications of early body types furnished            
              by trace and body fossils and the implied evolution of pattern-                
              formation capabilities of the genome; and (2) the radiation of                 
              (chiefly segmented) body types of higher invertebrates and the                 
              implied pattern of change in the tiers of genetic-regulatory                   
              control.
