Abstract    :
                   Four state colleges within the State of Nebraska (Kearney,                
              Wayne, Chadron, and Peru) will be linked to MIDnet and NSFnet.                 
              The connection will be at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.                  
              Funding will include equipment and line charges for two years.                 
              This network builds an infrastructure in the State of Nebraska                 
              for four-year, technical, and community colleges at both private               
              and public institutions.  The libraries at these institutions                  
              will use this network to share resources between campuses
