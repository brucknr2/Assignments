Abstract    :
              The P.I.'s will extend their work in neural network-based                      
              control technology by applying there concepts to the                           
              control wing surfaces of an aircraft.  Their neurocontrol                      
              algorithms will be used to deploy the active surfaces of a                     
              wing.  This will be simulated with neural networks                             
              monitoring various sensors and controlling the active                          
              wing surfaces.  The P.I.'s believe that it is possible to take                 
              control theory that has been used in robotics and develop                      
              it to function in aeronautical applications.  To prove this,                   
              they will employ a system they are using in a robotic                          
              application that is based on a distributed adaptive control                    
              theory developed by Seraji (1989) and enhanced with                            
              neural networks.  They will use a multiple neural network                      
              systems approach as outlined in their NSF Final Report                         
              (                                                                              
              will be tested in a flight simulation and demonstrated in                      
              a realistic scenario on a high resolution, three                               
              dimensional graphics workstation.
