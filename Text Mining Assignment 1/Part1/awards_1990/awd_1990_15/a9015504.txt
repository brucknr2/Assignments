Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The two-day workshop will take place following                                 
              the Western Pacific Geophysics Congress, on                                    
              August 28-29, 1990, at Yamanashi University,                                   
              Japan.  The purpose of the meeting is to                                       
              discuss and develop a research agenda related                                  
              to hydrologic hazards and water resources                                      
              engineering issues which would be of mutual                                    
              interest to United States and Japanese                                         
              experts.  The research topics identified will                                  
              provide both countries with the basis on which                                 
              collaborative research can be built.  The                                      
              recommendations of the workshop will be                                        
              published in a report and disseminated to both                                 
              countries hydrologic/natural hazards                                           
              communities.
