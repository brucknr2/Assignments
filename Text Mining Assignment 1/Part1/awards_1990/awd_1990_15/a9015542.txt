Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will investigate the feasibility of applying a                    
              pretensioned fiber composite plastic sheet bonded to the                       
              exterior of a concrete girder to increase the load                             
              resistance of the girder.  The method may have application                     
              to new bridge construction as well as existing bridges.
