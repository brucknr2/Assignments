Abstract    :
              Dr. Scheraga is carrying out a combined experimental and                       
              theoretical research program designed to elucidate the energies                
              and mechanism of the folding of a polypeptide chain into the                   
              native conformation of a protein, and of the action of the                     
              resulting protein (enzyme or hormone) on a substrate or                        
              receptor.  While current potential functions are sufficiently                  
              accurate for several of the applications that he has made, his                 
              analysis of these potentials (and also of others in the                        
              literature) indicates that it is time for a completely new look                
              at the underlying form ( and parameterization of the                           
              potentials); this is the first goal of the proposed work.                      
              Secondly, some very successful methods have been developed to                  
              surmount the multiple-minima problem for small polypeptides and                
              he will devote his efforts to improving them, and extending                    
              them to globular proteins containing of the order of 100                       
              residues.  He will test the methods on crambin and bovine                      
              pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, and then use them to compute the                 
              structure of interferon.  He will also treat large assemblies                  
              of fibrous proteins, viz. collagen.
