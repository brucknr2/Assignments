Abstract    :
              Research on GaAs/A1As quantum well                                             
              structures will be conducted in                                                
              collaboration with Dr. Mitra Dutta                                             
              and her co-workers at U.S. Army                                                
              Electronic Technology and Devices                                              
              Laboratory (ETDL), Fort Monmouth.                                              
              The program will emphasize study of                                            
              GaAs/A1GaAs quantum wells perturbed                                            
              by the addition of thin A1As barrier                                           
              at the center of each well using                                               
              reflectance and photoluminescence                                              
              spectroscopies.  The goal is to                                                
              explore a new method of tuning                                                 
              intersubband transition energies for                                           
              FIR detector applications.
