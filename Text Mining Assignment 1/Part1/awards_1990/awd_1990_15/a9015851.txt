Abstract    :
                   The goal of this research is to increase the current knowledge            
              base in the field of numerically controlled (NC) machining of                  
              sculptured surfaces.  This research applies geometric simulation               
              methods to three and five axis sculptured surface tool path                    
              generation.  Specifically, the following questions are being                   
              explored: (1) What are the best algorithms for subdivision of                  
              sculptured surfaces into a polygonal representation to be used for             
              NC tool path generation? (2) What is the time/accuracy trade-off               
              in using points versus polygons as a surface representation for NC             
              tool path generation? (3) Can the non-isoparametric tool path                  
              planning algorithm developed for three axis machining be extended              
              to the five axis case? (4) Can efficient and accurate geometric                
              models of the volume swept by a five axis tool movement be defined?            
              (5) Can parallel algorithms be applied to the NC tool path planning            
              problem?                                                                       
                   This project is an interdisciplinary collaboration between the            
              Mechanical Engineering Department at the University of New                     
              Hampshire, the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at               
              Dartmouth College, and an industrial sponsor.  It has the potential            
              of greatly improving sculptured surface machining.  In practice,               
              it should enhance the production of metal forming dies.
