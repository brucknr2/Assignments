Abstract    :
                   Atmospheric ozone and other photochemical oxidants will be                
              studied at a rural mountain site in the Shenandoah Mountains of                
              Virginia, a region surrounded by natural hydrocarbon emissions                 
              and downwind of the industrialized midwest and the urbanized                   
              eastern seaboard.  Measurements of nitric oxide, ozone and UV                  
              light will be co-located and coincident with measurements of non-              
              methane hydrocarbons, carbonyl compounds, carboxylic acids,                    
              particulate and gaseous inorganic anions and cations, organic                  
              nitrates, hydrogen peroxide and organic hydroperoxides, which are              
              to be measured in clear air, interstitial air in cloud, and in                 
              two descrete size fractions of cloud water.  The data sets will                
              be combined and used to investigate net ozone production and                   
              oxidants in clear and cloudy air at a forested rural site with                 
              variable hydrocarbon and nitrogen oxide concentrations.  The                   
              combined data sets will be further used to elucidate mechanisms                
              of natural hydrocarbon oxidation.  The measurements represent the              
              first concurrent set of measurements in the gas and aqueous                    
              phases of non-methane hydrocarbons, their partially oxidized                   
              products (carbonyl compounds, carboxylic acids, organic                        
              hydroperoxides, organic nitrates), and the factors controlling                 
              ozone and other oxidants in-cloud.
