Abstract    :
                   Iron is found at variable levels in the atmosphere in both                
              aqueous-phases and solid phases.  Ferric iron has been shown to                
              be an important catalyst for the autoxidation of SO2 and                       
              concomitant generation of acidity in clouds and fogs.  Recent                  
              field research has provided strong evidence that Fe derived from               
              atmospheric deposition is a limiting growth nutrient for various               
              species of phytoplankton in some regions of the open ocean.  Thus              
              the atmospheric deposition of iron in various forms (i.e. redox                
              states and species) could be a critical factor in controlling                  
              oceanic phytoplankton production which in turn may affect                      
              atmospheric CO2 levels.                                                        
                   The PIs propose to investigate the detailed chemical                      
              speciation of iron in atmospheric water droplets and in aerosol                
              samples collected from a variety of locations representative of                
              urban, rural and remote atmospheres.  They plan to determine the               
              various solid-phase and aqueous-phase chemical forms and                       
              oxidation states (speciation) of iron present in cloud-, fog- and              
              rainwater collected from marine and continental environments and               
              to interpret the experimental observations within the framework                
              of coupled thermodynamic and kinetic models.
