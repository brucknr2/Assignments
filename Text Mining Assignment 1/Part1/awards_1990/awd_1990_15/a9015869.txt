Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The purpose of this project is to develop the                                  
              planning and decision making tools for                                         
              optimum resource allocation in earthquake                                      
              risk mitigation.  Contributions will be made                                   
              from the fields of earthquake engineering,                                     
              operations research and management sciences.                                   
                                                                                             
              The project will develop the analytical                                        
              fundamentals, the numerical solutions, and                                     
              the practical applications of the resource

              management.  It is intended to develop the                                     
              tools that would identify the sequence of                                      
              strengthening procedures that minimize the                                     
              resources and maximize the earthquake risk                                     
              reduction considering monetary, time and                                       
              space constraints.
