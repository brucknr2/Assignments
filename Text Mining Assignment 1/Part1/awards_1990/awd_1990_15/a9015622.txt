Abstract    :
                   This grant will fund a 10 day conference on the Arithmetic                
              of Function Fields, held at Ohio State University on August 17-                
              26, 1991.  The purposes of the conference are 1) to introduce                  
              mathematicians (particularly graduate students and recent                      
              Ph.D.'s ) to the area, and 2) to serve as a forum for                          
              discussionof current progress and problems.  The first week of                 
              the conference will be devoted to lectures outlining in detail                 
              the general theory.  The morning talks will be of a foundational               
              nature, while the afternoon talks will be more advanced.  The                  
              last three days of the conference will be devoted to research                  
              talks on the subjects covered in the first week.  Participants of              
              the conference will also be invited to lecture.  Finally, a list               
              of open problems will be compiled and distributed to all                       
              participants.  Emphasis will be given to applications of the                   
              area.
