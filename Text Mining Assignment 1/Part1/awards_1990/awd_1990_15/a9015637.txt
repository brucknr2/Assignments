Abstract    :
                   This grant is to partially support a conference and workshop              
              to be held March 10-14, 1991 at Texas A&M University.                          
                   The topic of the conference, inverse problems in partial                  
              differential equations, arises from a wide variety of problems in              
              science and engineering. The availability of high speed computers              
              has allowed attempts at large scale problems of enormous social                
              and economic value, for example, the CAT scan and oil reservoir                
              simulations.  The question of non-uniqueness is a critical one                 
              for the development of numerical algorithms.  Determining the                  
              necessary amount of data in order that at most one solution can                
              exist is an important question; however, often one can redefine                
              the "solution class" in order to "answer" this question.  Even                 
              when this is not reasonable, the problem may be reformulated into              
              a "sufficiently close" problem for which the situation is much                 
              better.  The very fact that CAT scans work or that features of                 
              submarines can be detected by using reflected sound waves shows                
              that complex inverse problems can be, if not solved, at least                  
              negotiated.                                                                    
                   The conference participants will discuss whether one can                  
              find numerically implementable methods that give a unique                      
              solution to some closely related reformulation of problems in the              
              subareas of impedance tomography, inverse scattering and spectral              
              methods, and overposed boundary data.  The participants will test              
              these algorithms in a workshop atmosphere. //
