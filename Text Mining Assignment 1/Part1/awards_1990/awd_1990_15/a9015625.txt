Abstract    :
              This SMALL GRANT for EXPEDITED RESEARCH is made in order to                    
              expedite the study of a new concept in exact solutions of five                 
              problems in nonlinear elasticity.  Universal solutions will be                 
              attempted by the patching together of other solutions.
