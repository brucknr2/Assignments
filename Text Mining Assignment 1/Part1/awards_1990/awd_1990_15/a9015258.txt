Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The objective of the research are: (1) to                                      
              determine if it is possible and feasible to                                    
              test hypotheses about seismic mitigation at                                    
              the local level that have been suggested in                                    
              various case studies; and (2) to describe any                                  
              differences before and after the Loma Prieta                                   
              earthquake in the implementation of non-                                       
              structural hazard mitigation.  The unit of                                     
              analysis is the local jurisdiction (i.e.,                                      
              cities and counties).  The universe is all                                     
              jurisdictions in Seismic Zone 4 in the state                                   
              of California.  Quantitative data will be                                      
              gathered from a stratified random sample of                                    
              jurisdictions.  The first objective will                                       
              involve an attempt to specify and test a                                       
              model explaining various stages of completion                                  
              of a program for identifying and reducing the                                  
              hazardousness of pre-1934 unreinforced                                         
              masonry buildings (URMs).  The model will be                                   
              tested using logistic regression analysis.                                     
              The second objective will involve comparisons                                  
              of organizational characteristics of building                                  
              departments in the sample of jurisdictions                                     
              for Fiscal Years 1989 and 1990 (i.e., the                                      
              year prior to and the year following the                                       
              October 4, 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake).                                       
              Results should help to assess the prospects                                    
              for developing an empirically-verified                                         
              knowledge base in the area of hazard                                           
              mitigation upon which public policy may                                        
              comfortably rest.
