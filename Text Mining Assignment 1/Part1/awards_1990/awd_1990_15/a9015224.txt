Abstract    :
                   This Industry Internship project will be carried out in                   
              collaboration with Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), a major                
              manufacturer of electronic components.  The objective of the                   
              project is to develop a set of decision support tools for the                  
              effective scheduling and operation of a surface-mount production               
              time.  The analysis of generic scheduling algorithms and their                 
              operation within this environment will also be assessed.
