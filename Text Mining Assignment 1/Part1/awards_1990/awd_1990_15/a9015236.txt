Abstract    :
              This research is funded under the Special Initiative on                        
              Coordination Theory and Collaboration Technology.  This is one of              
              eleven winners under that competition.                                         
              This project involves an integrated program of theory building,                
              software tool development and assessment, and controlled                       
              experiments in distributed group support systems.  Such systems                
              embed group decision support system tools and procedures within a              
              computer-mediated communication system.  The primary objective of              
              the project is to build a general theory, supported by empirical               
              evidence, to understand how variations in group structures and                 
              software tools affect the process and outcome of decision making.              
              This multi-disciplinary effort focusses on synchronous computer                
              conference, in which participants are distributed in different                 
              locations, and on asynchronous computer conference, in which                   
              participation is distributed in time as well as space.
