Abstract    :
              This project provides support for a workshop on the topic of                   
              artificial neural networks and their application in electric power             
              engineering planned for July 24-25, 1991 at the University of                  
              Washington, Seattle, WA.  The workshop will be the first international         
              meeting of its kind devoted to power engineering applications of this          
              novel technology.  A special emphasis is to be given for participation         
              from Pacific Rim countries -- and the second symposium, which will be          
              a follow-up to the present workshop, is expected to be held in Japan           
              in 1993.
