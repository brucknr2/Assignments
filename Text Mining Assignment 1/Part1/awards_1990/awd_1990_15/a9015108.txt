Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Most studies of the Sun require observations over time.  Thus a                
              variety of monitoring stations have been set around the world to               
              study solar phenomena on a variety of timescales.  An                          
              important source of solar observations in the U.S. is the 150-foot             
              "solar tower" telescope, located on Mount Wilson in California.                
              This facility has been used on virtually every clear day for the               
              last 23 years to study large and medium scale velocity and magnetic            
              features on the surface of the Sun.  In addition, its sister 90-               
              foot tower is used daily to make sunspot drawings.  These drawings             
              are transmitted to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric                        
              Administration which make forecasts of solar flare events and                  
              assesses their impact on the Earth's magnetosphere.  The Principal             
              Investigator (PI) proposes to continue these observations over the             
              next three years.  During the new grant period a variety of large              
              solar projects or spacecraft will be launched, such as the Solar               
              Orbiting Helio-Observatory, the "MAX 91" solar-activity maximum                
              campaign, and the Global Oscillation Network Group network, which              
              will utilize solar oscillations to infer the interior rotation and             
              density structure of the Sun.  The Mt. Wilson observations will                
              directly support these enterprises every clear day by providing an             
              extensive, homogenous dataset of magnetic activity and gas flows               
              on the solar surface.
