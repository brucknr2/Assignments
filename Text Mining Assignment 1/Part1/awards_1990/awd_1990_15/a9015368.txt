Abstract    :
              Douglas Doren is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and                 
              Computational Chemistry Program to study the dynamics and                      
              interactions of molecules on surfaces.  This research has a                    
              direct bearing on our understanding of the role which catalytic                
              surfaces play in promoting chemical reactions.                                 
                                                                                             
              Doren will use theoretical molecular dynamics to determine the                 
              underlying interactions and mechanisms involved in surface                     
              diffusion rates of molecular adsorbates.  He will explore the                  
              ways in which molecules differ from atoms in their modes of                    
              interaction with surfaces including the qualitative topology of                
              the potential energy surface, the adsorbate mass distribution,                 
              and possible modes of coupling between diffusion and adsorbate                 
              bending or vibrational modes. The result of this research will                 
              be a model of interacting, coadsorbed molecules which will be                  
              the foundation for general studies of coverage effects on                      
              surface dynamcis and catalysis.
