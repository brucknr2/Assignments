Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Nonlinear interactions in general relativity will be studied                   
              using a code that simulates the implosion and re-explosion of a                
              vacuum. axisymmetric gravitational wave.  As the wave amplitude                
              is increased, the wave begins to hold itself together                          
              (temporarily) by its own mass energy.  If the amplitude is large               
              enough a black hole will form and radiate off its asphercity.                  
              Another code, currently being tested against perturbation theory,              
              is being developed specifically to study black hole spacetimes.                
              It will be used to investigate the radiative properties of very                
              highly distorted single black holes and eventually to simulate                 
              the head-on collision of two black holes and calculate the                     
              gravitational waves emitted.
