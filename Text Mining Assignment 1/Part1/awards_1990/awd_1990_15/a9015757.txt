Abstract    :
                 The research focuses on developing queueing theories of                     
              multi-media traffic integration in high speed networks.                        
              Multi-media traffic has great diversity of traffic characteristics             
              and service requirements.  Because of the lack of analytical tools             
              for the evaluation of multi-media traffic queues, most analytical              
              issues of network control and service management are basically                 
              untouched. This research addresses these issues and includes:                  
                o  characterizing the diversity of multi-media traffic                       
                o  formulating a multi-dimensional discrete Markov queueing                  
                   process                                                                   
                o  developing analytical solution techniques                                 
                o  analyzing and decoupling the interconnected multi-media queues            
              The research also involves finding simple effective tools for                  
              analysis of network resource allocation and call management issues.            
              The researcher will first concentrate on developing a simple closed            
              form solution for the approximate average delay of multi-media                 
              traffic queues.  The tail distribution of the queues will also be              
              characterized in a simple geometric form, to capture  the packet               
              loss behavior of finite buffer systems.  Finally the researcher                
              will study the feasibility of decomposing the analysis of                      
              interconnected multi-media traffic queues.
