Abstract    :
              This project is a study of organic bromine chemistry in the lower              
              arctic atmosphere, particularly in relation to tropospheric                    
              destruction of ozone.  It has been observed that shortly after the             
              arctic sunrise, surface ozone concentrations decline from a late               
              winter maximum to near zero before recovering to moderately high               
              summer values.  There is also strong evidence which implies that               
              the primary cause for the minimum is the photolytic production of              
              bromine radicals from organic bromine gases, which then combine                
              with ozone.  The chemical pathways are conjectural and little is               
              known about the origins of the organic bromine, but it is believed             
              that a marine source is the most probable.  This study addresses               
              the latter question through a sampling and analysis program at                 
              Resolute, N.W.T., Canada, focusing on macrophytes, phytoplankton,              
              ice algae, benthic microalgae, and bacteria.  These will be tested             
              for organohalogen content and production/emission of bromine,                  
              chlorine, and iodine species, as well as oxygen and carbon-14.                 
              Physiological studies will describe environmental factors                      
              influencing release rates and coupling with other metabolic                    
              processes.  Atmospheric observations, including particulate                    
              bromine, and organic and inorganic gaseous bromine, are                        
              the subject of a separate project.  Supporting ozone and                       
              meteorological variables are measured routinely at the Barrow                  
              Observatory of the Geophysical Monitoring for Climatic Change                  
              Program of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
