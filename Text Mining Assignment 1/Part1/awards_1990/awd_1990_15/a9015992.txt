Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will support US participation in a US-France joint                  
              seminar on the topic of "Multiple Sigma and PCP Receptor                       
              Ligands:  Mechanisms for Neural Modulation and Protection?",                   
              to be held in Montpellier, France, in September 1991. The US                   
              and French organizers are: Dr. Edward Domino, Department of                    
              Pharmacology, University of Michigan, and Dr. Jean-Marc                        
              Kamenka, Ecole Nationale Superieure de Chimie, Montpellier,                    
              France.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              The seminar will cover the use of sigma and PCP receptor                       
              ligands in chemistry, biochemistry, molecular biology,                         
              neurobehavioral sciences, psychopharmacology and toxicology.                   
              Their interaction with different neurotransmitters or                          
              modulators will be updated and the search for specific sigma                   
              and PCP receptor agonists and antagonists will be described.                   
              PCP and its derivatives are currently important molecular                      
              probes in many aspects of biology and are also being considered                
              as novel therapy as antipsychotic, anticonvulsant and neural                   
              protective agents.  This seminar will bring together leading                   
              experts in this rapidly moving field of study and will                         
              provide an opportunity for valuable interactions. Results of                   
              the seminar will be published and are expected to be                           
              disseminated widely in the scientific community.
