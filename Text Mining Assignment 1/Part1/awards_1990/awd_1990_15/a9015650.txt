Abstract    :
                   This research is directed at the warping of printed wiring                
              boards, an increasingly detrimental factor in the assembly of fine             
              pitch components and connectors.  The research will determine the              
              controlling factors that create the warpage condition, evaluate the            
              influence of each factor, and determine which parameters can be                
              controlled or eliminated in order to reduce the degree of stress               
              related circuit card warpage.  Both experimental and numerical                 
              techniques will be used for this evaluation.
