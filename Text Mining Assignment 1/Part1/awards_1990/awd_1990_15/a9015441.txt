Abstract    :
              This research is funded under the Special Initiative on Coordination           
              Theory and Collaboration Technology.  This is one of eleven winners            
              under that competition.                                                        
              The goal of this project is to develop a conceptual framework and a            
              prototype system for collaboration in an asynchronous mode among               
              members of design teams.  The proposed design environments include             
              knowledge-based and graphic construction components with issue-based           
              hypermedia systems designed to support collaboration.  The                     
              application domain for the prototype system is the design of                   
              communications networks within buildings.  The complexity of such              
              projects forces large and heterogeneous groups to work together over           
              long periods of time.  The large and growing discrepancy between in            
              amount of potentially relevant knowledge for the design task and the           
              amount any one designer can know and remember puts limits on                   
              progress in design.  Overcoming this limit is a central challenge              
              for developers of systems that support both individual and                     
              collaborative design efforts.  The work in this project builds on              
              previous developments embodied in the FRAMER system for the design             
              of human-computer interfaces and the JANUS system for architectural            
              design.
