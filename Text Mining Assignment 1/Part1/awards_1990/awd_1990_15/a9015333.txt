Abstract    :
                   The goal of this research is to study the feasibility of                  
              applying neural networks to the real-time discrimination between               
              true defects and surface anomalies in float glass ribbon. At the               
              present time the industry uses a laser scanner system capable of               
              detecting defects in newly manufactured glass ribbon.  The system              
              does not distinguish between true defects and harmless surface                 
              anomalies which causes marketable glass to be wasted.                          
                      Data collection will be performed in a laboratory setting              
              using a laser scanner system identical to those currently working              
              in the factory.  The laboratory setup will be designed to simulate             
              the conditions as closely as possible, so that any result from this            
              study should be applicable to factory production.  Because a large             
              number of defect samples are available, the evaluation will focus              
              on neural networks which learn in a supervised mode.  At least two             
              such techniques will be utilized:  (1)  backpropagation network                
              with the generalized delta rule used as a learning algorithm; and              
              (2)  a technique which involves the use of the delta rule in a                 
              novel way.
