Abstract    :
                   Indiana University's Cyclotron Facility (IUCF) provides                   
              experimental resources for conduct of fundamental research in                  
              intermediate energy nuclear physics with light ions, utilizing                 
              a 200 MeV cyclotron and a 500 MeV Cooler ring.  IUCF is a                      
              national user facility, serving over 240 researchers.  The                     
              central research thrust is polarized proton and neutron                        
              scattering, and is aimed at the study of nuclear structure,                    
              effective nucleon-nucleon interactions in nuclei, few body                     
              systems, threshold pion production, pionic atoms, and more.                    
                   The core of the cyclotron research program is in charge                   
              exchange studies and inelastic proton scattering, both with                    
              polarized beams, and makes use of a high resolution magnetic                   
              spectrometer with focal plane polarimeter and of a neutron                     
              time-of-flight facility.  The Cooler program is used in the                    
              study of threshold pion production, pionic atoms, dibaryon                     
              searches, nuclear structure with recoil particle detection,                    
              accelerator physics of spin transport, polarized few-nucleon                   
              gasjet targets, and more.  Instrumentation development in                      
              support of the research program and of users is an essential                   
              function at IUCF, and includes development of such items as                    
              specialized spectrometers, polarized targets, detectors,                       
              beamline apparatus, polarized ion sources, and related                         
              equipment.                                                                     
                   Graduate students are integrated into all aspects of IUCF                 
              research, including equipment development, and their training                  
              is a prominent aspect of IUCF activities.
