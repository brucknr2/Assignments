Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The proposal intends to study the Hubbard model of itinerant                   
              magnetism in order to ascertain the effect of electron correlation             
              on the energy bandwidths of simple metals.    A very strong                    
              coupling model will also be investigated to explain the large                  
              energy gaps observed in high Tc superconductors.  A theory of the              
              piezoelectric constants will be investigated for ionic solids.                 
              The localized states of the minority charge carriers in                        
              semiconductors will also be studied.  The investigtor also plans to            
              continue his investigations of quantum wells.  Further, work will              
              be done on the Kapitza thermal boundary resistance in insulators               
              and phonon drag in simple metals.
