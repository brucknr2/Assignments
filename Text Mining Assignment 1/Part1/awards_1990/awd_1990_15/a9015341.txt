Abstract    :
              This travel services work order (AMEX 91-AS-01) supports the travel            
              and per diem costs of six U.S. university-based scientists to                  
              enable them to attend the U.S.-Australia Joint Seminar on Radiation            
              Effects on Polymeric Materials to be held in Stanford, California,             
              from August 18 through August 22, 1991.  The meeting is organized              
              in the U.S. by Professor Curtis Frank of Stanford's Department of              
              Chemical Engineering and Dr. Elsa Reichmanis of AT&T Bell Labs.                
              A similar number of Australian scientists will attend with support             
              from the Australian Department of Trade, Industry and Commerce,                
              organized by Professor James O'Donnell of the Department of                    
              Chemistry, University of Queensland.  Additional participants from             
              industry and third countries will attend with non-NSF means of                 
              support.                                                                       
              Over five days of meetings, the participants will discuss the way              
              in which radiation affects the physical, chemical and engineering              
              properties of polymers, a topic of great importance to the                     
              electronics and space industries of the U.S. and Australia.
