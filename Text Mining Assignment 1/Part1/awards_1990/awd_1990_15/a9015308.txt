Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The area of research for this project is the iterative solution                
              of large sparese linear systems of equations on vector                         
              and parallel computers.  The goal of this research is to develop               
              iterative algorithms which are adapted to parallel computers and               
              which exploit the properties of parallel architectures.  Three                 
              particular topics will be studied.  First adaptive procedures for              
              polynomial preconditioning of symmetric indefinite systems will                
              be developed and tested.  Second, research will be done on an                  
              adaptive polynomial method for solving nonsymmetric systems of                 
              equations for which the specturm of the matrix lies in an                      
              arbitrary region in the complex plane.  A third topic of research              
              will be the parallelization of restarted generalized conjugate                 
              gradient algorithms such as the GMRES algotithm.  The goal of                  
              each of these topics of research is to develop algorithms which                
              are better suited to highly parallel architectures.
