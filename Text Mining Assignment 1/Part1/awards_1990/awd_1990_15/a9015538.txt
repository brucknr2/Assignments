Abstract    :
              This research is concerned with the study of the electronic                    
              properties of thermodynamically stable quasicrystals.  Recent                  
              results have shown several of these icosahedral crystals possess               
              unusual electronic properties which may be related to exotic                   
              electronic states predicted by theorists.  The present research                
              aims to study the structural, atomic-potential and                             
              dimensionality effects by measuring the magneto-conductivity,                  
              thermopower, Hall effect, and specific heat of several selected                
              and well characterized two- and three-dimensional quasicrystals                
              and their amorphous and crystalline analogs.  The possibliity of               
              establishing localized states in the supposedly metallic                       
              quasicrystals with strong atomic potentials will be examined.                  
              The study will continue to investigate fine structure in the                   
              density-of-states, which is central to recent theoretical                      
              predictions.  The magnetic phases of 2D and 3D quasicrystals and               
              in the new aluminum glasses with both well defined magnetic sites              
              and localized moments by neutron scattering and magnetic                       
              measurements.  Spin structures in real-space and in hypercubic                 
              lattices will be analyzed.
