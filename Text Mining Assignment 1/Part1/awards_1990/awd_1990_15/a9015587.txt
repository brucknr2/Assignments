Abstract    :
                   This research is in the area of blind equalization and channel             
                                                                                            
              impulse response estimation for digital communication systems,                 
              including telephone channels as well as digital radio channels.                
                                                                                             
              One of the main objectives of the research is to propose and                   
              analyze novel schemes for reliable initialization of the                       
              conventional decision directed equalizers.  Both batch an recursive            
                                                                                             
              methods are considered.  It is known that the second order                     
              statistics are inadequate for ISI removal since the communication              
                                                                                             
              channel models are nonminimum-phase in general.  Therefore,                    
              emphasis is on exploitation of higher order cumulant statistics,               
                                                                                             
              in addition to the usual second order statistics, of the data and              
                                                                                             
              of appropriately defined error signals.  Another objective is to               
                                                                                             
              design and analyze novel globally convergent blind equalizers based            
                                                                                             
              on second and fourth order cumulant statistics of the data.
