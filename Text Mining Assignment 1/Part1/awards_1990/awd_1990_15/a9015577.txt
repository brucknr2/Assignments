Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              This award supports continued research into programming language               
              support for parallel scientific computation on (MIMD) distributed              
              memory multiprocessors.  It is becoming clear that this class of               
              parallel computers will play an important role in the future of                
              large scale scientific computation.  Currently, however, such                  
              computers are very difficult to program.  The goal of this research            
              is to make it considerably easier and more natural to program these            
              computers for large scale parallel scientific computation, without             
              sacrificing the run-time efficiency of the resultant code.  A second           
              goal is to make such programs portable between different distributed           
              memory multiprocessors.  The main issues are high-level language               
              support for parallel numerical algorithms that use dynamic data and            
              process structures.  The researchers will interact extensively with            
              scientists who are (potential) users of these computers.  This                 
              interaction is aimed at increasing understanding of the paradigms              
              that underline the scientists' parallel algorithms, integrating these          
              paradigms into programming language research, and assessing how well           
              this research is meeting their needs.//
