Abstract    :
              This State-of-the-Art survey award will send Professors Surendra               
              Shah and J. Francis Young, of the Advanced Cement-Based Materials              
              Center at Northwestern University, to Japan to survey university,              
              government, and industrial laboratories for advances in cement-                
              based materials and concrete construction and to investigate future            
              cooperation and exchanges of researchers.  Japan's public sector               
              and construction industry spend considerably more on research and              
              development than do their United States counterparts, resulting in             
              significant advances over the past twenty years such as super-                 
              plasticizers.  The two investigators intend to explore possible                
              arrange ments for U.S. faculty members and post-docs to spend time             
              in Japanese research institutes.
