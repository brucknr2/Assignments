Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The El Verde research area of the Luquillo Experimental Forest                 
              was severely affected by hurricane Hugo on 18 September 1989.                  
              Hurricane Hugo, a category four hurricane, struck this area with               
              maximum sustained winds of 225 kph mostly from the north and                   
              northeast.  Disturbance to the trees ranged from partial                       
              defoliation to severe structural damage.  Drs. Lodge and Taylor                
              will use this project to establish a permanent 16-hectare grid                 
              with marked and measured trees.  They will assess the                          
              distribution of damage to the vegetation in terms of species                   
              composition and topographic relief.  These data will allow the                 
              investigators to follow regeneration along gradients of                        
              disturbance and provide a basis for long-term studies of animal                
              responses, succession, and decomposition processes.                            
                                                                                             
              These scientists have a strong background in forest ecology and                
              are well qualified to conduct this research. The 30-year history               
              of extensive research in the El Verde area is an excellent                     
              feature of this project. And institutional support and facilities              
              available for this project are more than adequate.
