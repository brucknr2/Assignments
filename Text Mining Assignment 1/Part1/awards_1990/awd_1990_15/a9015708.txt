Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will study interacting super-                  
              Brownian motions.  Super-Brownian motion is a measure-valued                   
              diffusion that arises as a high density limit for a population of              
              particles evolving in such a way that the total number of                      
              particles grows as a critical, continuous-time, Galton-Watson                  
              branching process, whilst in between births/deaths the particles               
              move as independent Brownian motions.  The goal of this research               
              is to construct similar models for two populations which                       
              incorporate localized interaction terms.  The import of these                  
              extra terms is to capture competition effects in which the                     
              presence of individuals from one population adversely affects the              
              chance for individuals from the other population to successfully               
              replicate themselves.
