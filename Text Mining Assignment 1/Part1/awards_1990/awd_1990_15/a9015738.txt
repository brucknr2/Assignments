Abstract    :
              Several technologies are in use for the safe treatment of                      
              hazardous wastes.  Some of these include adsorption,                           
              incineration, and biodegradation.  Aqueous waste streams with                  
              moderate organic concentrations (1-30%)  may be too dilute for                 
                                                                                             
              economical incineration and too concentrated for treatment by                  
              adsorption or biodegradation.  For such streams oxidation in                   
              supercritical water (SCW) is a potential alternative                           
              technology.  Hazardous organic chemicals present in aqueous                    
              waste streams can thus be converted to carbon dioxide and                      
              water.  This work is aimed at understanding the kinetics of                    
              the oxidation of hazardous organic wastes in SCW to be used in                 
                                                                                             
              the design and development of such processes.                                  
                                                                                             
              Phenol, naphthalene, chlorobenzene and acetic acid will be                     
              oxidized in SCW.  The oxidation reactions will be conducted in                 
                                                                                             
              a flow reactor and the products will be analyzed by high                       
              performance liquid chromatography, gas chromatography, and gas                 
                                                                                             
              chromatography mass spectrometry.  Examining the variation of                  
              the products' yields and the reactant conversion with the                      
              reactor residence time will facilitate resolution of the                       
              reaction pathways and determination of the reaction kinetics.                  
                                                                                             
              The project will provide opportunities for practical                           
              engineering advances as well as fundamental advances in                        
              understanding chemical reaction processes in supercritical                     
              fluids.
