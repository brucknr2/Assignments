Abstract    :
                   Approximately seventy leading experts from the United States              
              and other nations will gather at the Innovation, Creativity and                
              Capital Institute, at the University of Texas at Austin for a                  
              two-day meeting to identify and prioritize basic and generic                   
              research opportunities dealing with the life cycle of concurrent               
              engineering design.                                                            
                   Concurrent engineering has been defined as a systematic                   
              approach to the integrated design of products and their related                
              processes.  Engineers utilizing concurrent design techniques                   
              consider all strategic elements of the product life cycle from                 
              conception through disposal.                                                   
                   Concurrent engineering design is a particularly timely                    
              subject for an international workshop because of its implications              
              for increasing the competitiveness of U.S. industry.  Concurrent               
              design leads to shortened lead times in introducing producible                 
              and maintainable products and reduced total costs of doing                     
              business.
