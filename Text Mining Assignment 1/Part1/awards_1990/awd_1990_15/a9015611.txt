Abstract    :
              This award will support a group of approximately 25 U.S. and Caribbean         
              scientists, representing around 20 regional marine research institu-           
              tions, to participate in a workshop organized by Prof. John C. Ogden           
              of the University of South Florida and collaborators.  The workshop,           
              which is to take place at the Discovery Bay Marine Laboratory of the           
              University of the West Indies in Jamaica, will discuss and conduct             
              fields trials for a suite of standardized physical (temperature,               
              salinity, light attenuation, and suspended solids) and biological              
              (community structure and growth rate of principal species) measure-            
              ments.  This monitoring program will be implemented with UNESCO                
              funding following the workshop as the core of the Caribbean Coastal            
              Marine Productivity (CARICOMP) program.                                        
                                                                                             
              The Workshop will be led by a staff of experts in Caribbean marine             
              ecosystems and will be guided by a draft Methods Manual produced with          
              UNESCO support since the CARICOMP program was started at a UNESCO/NSF          
              supported workshop in Jamaica in 1985.  A key element will be the              
              establishment of data management protocols consistent with proper              
              statistical procedures.  The CARICOMP program is directed at an                
              understanding of long-term coastal ecosystem change through comparative        
              ecosystem studies at the geographic scale of the Caribbean and                 
              adjacent waters.  The requested support will allow the implementation          
              of the program at a time of increasing conviction that we are                  
              entering an unprecedented era of marine ecosystem change caused by             
              human impact and global climate change.
