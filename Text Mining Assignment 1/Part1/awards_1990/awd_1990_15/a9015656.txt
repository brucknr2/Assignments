Abstract    :
                   The major thrust of this research is to develop a process                 
              for fabricating metal oxide semiconductor transistors on a                     
              silicon-germanium alloy epitaxial strained-layer, since such                   
              transistors are significantly faster than comparable silicon                   
              devices.  The knowledge and understanding of silicon-                          
              germanium/silicon and silicon dioxide/silicon-germanium                        
              interfacial properties are crucial to the metal oxide                          
              semiconductor field effect transistor fabrication.  First,                     
              silicon-germanium strained epitaxial layer will be grown on                    
              silicon using chemical vapor deposition process.  The thermal                  
              oxide with thicknesses ranging from 250 to 500 Angstroms will be               
              grown in a dry oxygen ambient.  At this stage a few sample wafers              
              will be subjected to high resolution transmission electron                     
              microscopy analysis to determine the misfit dislocation density                
              at the silicon-germanium/silicon interface and the planarity of                
              silicon dioxide/silicon-germanium interface.  Metal oxide                      
              semiconductor capacitor structures will be fabricated on the                   
              remaining wafers and after metallization, quasi-static                         
              capacitance-voltage measurements will be taken to extract fixed                
              charge density and interface trap charges.                                     
                   This work should lay the foundation to the manufacturability              
              of metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors on silicon-              
              germanium/silicon alloys.
