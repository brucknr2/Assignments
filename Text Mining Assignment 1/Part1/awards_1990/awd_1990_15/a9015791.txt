Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Research will be conducted on mesoscopic descriptions of non-                  
              equilibrium phenomena associated with materials science.  Models of            
              non-equilibrium systems will be studied in terms of discrete space-            
              time maps, which permit efficient computational tools to be                    
              developed.  Using this approach dynamical scaling properties will              
              be studied using both numerical and analytical techniques,                     
              including renormalization group techniques.  Specific systems to be            
              studied within the scope of the grant include: spinodal                        
              decomposition of polymeric systems, including hydrodynamics;                   
              dynamics of crystal surface reorganization; the effect of                      
              coexisting phase ordering on spinodal decomposition; polymer                   
              crystal growth; dynamical scaling at the onset of gelation; and,               
              vulcanization.
