Abstract    :
                   The objectives of this research is to develop a                           
              deterministic machining process capable of producing aspherical                
              glass components with a surface damage layer in the 2-5                        
              characteristic indentation dimensions range. Such components                   
              could then be finished, using traditional polish techniques, in                
              substantial shorter time than is currently possible, greatly                   
              enhancing the producibility of larger aspherical glass optics.                 
                   Another important task of the research plan is to study the               
              surfaces produced in glass grinding, with the aim of                           
              characterizing the surface damage and subsurface damage resulting              
              from the precision grinding process.  This involves post-grinding              
              examination of the glass surface (or replicas of the surface)                  
              using stylus profilometry, optical microscopy, and scanning                    
              electron microscope.
