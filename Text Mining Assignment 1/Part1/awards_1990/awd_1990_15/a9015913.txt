Abstract    :
                   This project will support curriculum development for a                    
              collection of combinatorics courses which will be offered to                   
              first-year students at the University of Michigan.  These courses              
              will offer an alternative to calculus as first courses in                      
              mathematics at the college level.  They are designed to be                     
              challenging courses which stress experimentation and discovery as              
              vehicles for learning.  The goals of this curriculum development               
              effort include: (1) the development of critical and independent                
              thinking by students of mathematics early in their mathematical                
              education; (2) the creation of a new alternate vision of                       
              mathematics which points out its experimental side; and (3) the                
              generation of excitement about mathematics by those beginning its              
              study at the undergraduate level.
