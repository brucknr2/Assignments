Abstract    :
              The proposed projects that will benefit from a high performance                
              parallel computer are concerned with the molecular mechanisms of               
              excitability in nerve, muscle, and other cells.  Dr. Anthony                   
              Auerbach will study the kinetic properties of single ion channel               
              currents elicited by the neurotransmitters acetylcholine or                    
              glutamate.  Dr. Donald Faber will carry out computer modeling of               
              synaptic currents in conjunction with experimental studies of                  
              central glycinergic synapses.  Dr. Frederick Sachs will study the              
              structure and dynamics of mechanosensitive ion channels as seen                
              by high resolution image processing of membrane patches.  A long               
              term goal of these studies is to understand the molecular                      
              processes by which cells regulate ionic fluxes in response to                  
              environmental stimuli such as the presence of neurotransmitter                 
              molecules of membrane tension.  They all require computationally-              
              intense algorithms include matrix operations, Monte Carlo                      
              simulations, and three dimensional image processing                            
              (deconvolution and tomographic reconstruction).  Acquisition of a              
              parallel computer capable of sustaining at least 150 MFLOPS will               
              significantly expedite these calculations.
