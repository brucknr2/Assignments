              Funding is requested for a one day program, "Minorities in Biology:            
              Opportunities for Growth" to be held August 8, 1990 at the 41st                
              annual meeting of AIBS in Richmond, Virginia.  The program will                
              consist of a morning program for high school students in the local             
              region, a buffet lunch for high school students and teachers, an               
              afternoon symposium, and an evening reception for all participants             
              in the meeting.                                                                
                                                                                             
              The goals of the program include:                                              
                                                                                             
                   1.   To inform high school and college students of ethnic                 
                        minority groups about career opportunities in biology;               
                   2.   to increase contact between ethnic minority biologists,              
                        especially at historically black colleges and                        
                        universities, and other professional biologists; and                 
                   3.   to raise the awareness among professional biologists of              
                        issues, concerns, and opportunities regarding ethnic                 
                        minorities in biology.
