Abstract    :
              This award is made in the Special Projects Program in support                  
              of the second Annual National Symposium on Frontiers of                        
              Science, sponsored by the National Academy of Sciences.  The                   
              symposium brings together 75-85 outstanding young U.S.                         
              scientists to discuss cutting edge research advances and                       
              opportunities across a broad range of disciplines. Chemistry,                  
              biology, astronomy, geosciences, materials science, mathematics                
              and physics will be represented. Science journalists will also                 
              be invited to attend and a science writer will be engaged to                   
              prepare a monograph of the symposium.                                          
                                                                                             
              The central purpose of the symposium is to foster communication                
              and possible collaborations among the likely future leaders of                 
              U.S. science.
