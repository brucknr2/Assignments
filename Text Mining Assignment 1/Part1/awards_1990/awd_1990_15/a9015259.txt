Abstract    :
                   A group of computational researchers of the University of                 
              Colorado-Denver will be involved in a study of multilevel                      
              algorithms, focussing on new technologies and advanced                         
              computational architerutres and environments.                                  
                   The research is categorized among the following eight                     
              topics:
