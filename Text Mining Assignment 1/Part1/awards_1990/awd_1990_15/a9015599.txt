Abstract    :
                   The first GEM (Geospace Environment Modelling) theory-                    
              observing campaign addresses problems of the magnetopause,                     
              boundary layers, and their signatures in the cusp of the                       
              ionosphere.  Participants in the observing workshop held last                  
              October 1989 at the University of Maryland determined that the                 
              first task of the campaign should be the confident identification              
              of cusp signatures in ground-based and airborne data by                        
              intercalibrating with spacecraft particle data on direct                       
              overflights of the ground-based and airborne facilities.  The                  
              relatively easily recognized cusp particle signatures from the                 
              spacecraft instruments would serve as a Rosetta stone for                      
              deciphering signatures below.  To this end, a pilot data-                      
              gathering program took place in the vicinity of the dark cusp on               
              January 16, 1990, and many groups are gathering archival data for              
              intercalibration.  This grant is for a workshop to bring these                 
              data together for analysis and theoretical interpretation.
