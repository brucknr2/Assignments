Abstract    :
                   This investigation is designed to continue experimental and               
              analytical studies of the large scale dynamical phenomena in the               
              heliosphere resulting from the solar polar magnetic field                      
              polarity reversals , and to study solar flare charged particle                 
              acceleration in the present solar cycle.  The first objective                  
              will focus on charged particles as probes of heliospheric                      
              magnetic fields, whose origin is the solar magnetic field carried              
              throughout the heliosphere by the solar wind. The second                       
              objective will consist of experimental investigations for solar                
              flare particle acceleration using measurements of the energy                   
              spectrum and elemental and isotopic composition of the solar                   
              flares obtained from spacecraft data.  Both objectives will                    
              require extensive use of neutron monitors and of data from a                   
              network of instruments aboard several spacecraft. The proposed                 
              research will therefore include continued operation and                        
              maintenance of neutron monitoring stations at Climax, CO and                   
              Huancayo, Peru, with the possible addition of a new station in                 
              Maui, Hawaii. This latter station will eventually replace the one              
              in Peru.
