Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The brain of mammals is not believed to add any more nerve cells               
              (neurons) after birth, although the functional connections of the              
              nervous system may continue to increase, and be modified by                    
              experience.  There are whole populations of identifiably                       
              different classes of cells in the nervous system, and much of                  
              neuroscience is concerned with determining the structure and                   
              function of such classifiable cell groups.  This small pilot                   
              project will use a transgenic biotechnology as a novel approach                
              to see whether a one class of photoreceptor cells in the eye can               
              be selectively destroyed.  Molecular biological techniques will                
              be used to produce a strain of mice containing a toxic gene                    
              linked to a normal gene coding for a pigment molecule important                
              in photoreception; when a photoreceptor cell starts to make its                
              internal pigment, the toxic gene also will be expressed to kill                
              the cell.  Anatomical and neurophysiological data will be used to              
              test the efficacy of the removal.  The capability of selective                 
              deletion of specific classes of cells in the nervous system will               
              provide a new tool for correlating function with structure, and                
              will have a big impact on many areas of neuroscience and                       
              developmental biology.
