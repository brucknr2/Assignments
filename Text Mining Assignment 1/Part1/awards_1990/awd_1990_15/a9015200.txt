Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              The production of the hormone progesterone is important for the                
              maintenance of pregnancy in the mammalian system.  There are two groups        
              of granulosa cells found in the ovary prior to ovulation that may              
              possibly be involved in the maintenance of pregnancy.  The PI wants to         
              determine the function of one group, namely the cumulus granulosa cells        
              during pregnancy since these cells disappear right after ovulation and         
              their role remains a mystery.  It is already known that the other              
              group, the mural granulosa cells, become part of the corpus luteum             
              following ovulation and produce progesterone.  An attempt will be made         
              here to compare the relative abilities of these two cell populations           
              to secrete progesterone under simulated in vivo conditions using a             
              newly developed technique known as the kidney transplantation                  
              procedure.  The cells will be placed under the kidney capsule of a             
              pregnant rat and observed for secretion of progesterone.  This SGER            
              proposal is considered high risk because of the uncertainty that this          
              unique technique will provide the feasibility of assessing the in vivo         
              function of the cumulus granulosa cells.
