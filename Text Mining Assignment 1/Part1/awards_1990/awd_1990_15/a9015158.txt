Abstract    :
                   The University of Michigan's Fish Collection contains more                
              than 3 million specimens and approximately 2,000 type specimens,               
              making it the largest university-held fish collection in the                   
              country and the fourth largest fish collection in North America.               
              This collection was one of the first to be catalogued on                       
              microcomputers, and it remains one of the leaders in its                       
              applications of computer databases for research and curation.                  
              Dr. William Fink, Curator of the collection, proposes continued                
              curatorial improvements to the curation of the collection and an               
              upgrade for the database hardware and software.  New storage                   
              containers will assure the long-term preservation of large                     
              specimens, and an active program of visiting specialists will                  
              identify new accessions into the collection so that others may                 
              study them.  New computer equipment will provide dial-in access                
              by research scientists at remote sites.                                        
                   The proposed improvements will increase the research impact               
              of this important collection.  Systematists, ecologists,                       
              biogeographers, and investigators from a variety of other                      
              disciplines will benefit from the continued improvements to this               
              valuable research resource.
