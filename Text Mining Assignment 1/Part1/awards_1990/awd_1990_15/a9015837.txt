Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The translation or conversion of shape into quantitative terms so              
              that different shapes can be compared and interpreted is a profound            
              problem in Systematic Biology.  The research will provide                      
              information on the application of the fitting techniques that will             
              be of use to researchers in many areas of biology and on the nature            
              of shape variation of importance to those interested in ecological             
              and evolutionary questions concerning turtles.  The proposed                   
              research has two main goals.  The first is to compare existing and             
              newly developed rotational fitting methods using a set of three-               
              dimensional landmark locations from biological material.  The data             
              will consist of the coordinate locations of biologically and                   
              geometrically defined landmarks on the carapace of the yellow-                 
              bellied turtle. Trachemys scripta scripta.  The second goal is to              
              use this data to investigate shape differences resulting from                  
              sexual dimorphism, habitat-related growth differences, and                     
              geographic variation within this subspecies.
