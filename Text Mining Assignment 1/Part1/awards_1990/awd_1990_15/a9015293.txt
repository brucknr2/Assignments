Abstract    :
              With the support of the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and                            
              Organometallic Chemistry Program Dr. D. Michael Heinekey of                    
              Yale University will continue his investigations of a newly                    
              discovered process by which pairs of hydrogen atoms in certain                 
              organometallic hydrides exchange positions without breaking the                
              metal-hydrogen bonds. Organometallic hydrides constitute an                    
              important class of industrial catalysts, and this project is                   
              expected to help provide a better understanding of the                         
              mechanism of catalytic action.                                                 
                                                                                             
              A new quantum mechanical process involving pairwise tunnelling                 
              of protons at high temperatures has been discovered in certain                 
              transition metal polyhydride complexes. This process leads to                  
              exceptionally large proton-proton coupling constants in the                    
              nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra of these complexes.                   
              The scope of this novel phenomenon will be defined by the                      
              synthesis of additional polyhydride complexes with different                   
              transition metals and a variety of ligands in addition to                      
              hydrogen. The detailed mechanism of the tunnelling process will                
              be investigated using inelastic neutron scattering, structure                  
              determination by neutron diffraction, and NMR spectroscopy,                    
              with particular emphasis on tritium NMR spectroscopy.
