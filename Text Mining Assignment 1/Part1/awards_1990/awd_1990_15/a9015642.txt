Abstract    :
                   The objective of the research is to develop Computer Numerical            
              Control (CNC) Spreading Machines to enhance their versatility and              
              performance and ultimately the productivity and competitiveness of             
              the garment industry. This objective will be achieved by the                   
              development of a computer numerical controller for spreading                   
              machines as well as advanced control algorithms for fabric                     
              spreading.  The computer numerical controller with a position                  
              feedback transducer will enable the implementation of the following            
              functionalities:  auto threading/rewinding, auto turntable                     
              rotation, auto tension feed compensator, auto roll unwinding                   
              system, auto edge alignment, auto lay height sensing elevator, and             
              the flexibility of producing large number of different drop sizes              
              with programmable lay length, ply height and step-laying.  The                 
              intelligent learning control schemes taking advantage of the                   
              repetitiveness of the spreading process and accommodating the                  
              changing mass of the fabric roll will enable an increased spreading            
              speed with precise ply length--higher productivity and less waste              
              of fabric.
