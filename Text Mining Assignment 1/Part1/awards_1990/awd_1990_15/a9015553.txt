              This project supports a two week Summer Institute on Advanced                  
              Computing at the San Diego Supercomputer Center.  Twenty students              
                                                                                             
              will attend with selection based on peer review of applications.               
                                                                                             
              Additional industrial participants will be included on a fee basis.            
                                                                                             
              The Institute will consist of lectures and workstation sessions,               
                                                                                             
              commencing with lectures on supercomputing basics and progressing              
                                                                                             
              to advanced topics.  Special emphasis will be placed on advanced               
                                                                                             
              computing techniques.  Students will learn and practice varied                 
              techniques including vectorization, optimization and multitasking              
                                                                                             
              on projects related to their personal research interests.  Each                
              student will be conducted by SDSC faculty and experienced                      
              consultants will assist the students in their research programs.
