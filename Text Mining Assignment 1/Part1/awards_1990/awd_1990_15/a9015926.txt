Abstract    :
                   This project will develop numerical methods for the solution              
              of ill-posed integral and operator equations.  The methods are                 
              based on a new general approach to sampling theorems for                       
              functions in reproducing kernel subspaces of a Sobolev space.                  
              Various types of errors (truncation, aliasing, jitter, and                     
              amplitude) will be studied.  Sampling theory for regular                       
              Mikusinski operators as well as wavelet sampling of ill-                       
              posed problems will be initiated.                                              
                   This project is motivated by several applications                         
              arising in subjects ranging from radar technology to oil                       
              recovery. These studies are part of the foundation of software                 
              development in applications such as scanning and tomography
