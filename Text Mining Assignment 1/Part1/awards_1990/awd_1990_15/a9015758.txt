Abstract    :
                   The objective of this internship project is to assess the                 
              effectiveness of expert system technology in the analysis and                  
              interpretation of Statistical Process Control charts in a wire                 
              harness manufacturing setting.  A prototype expert system will be              
              built using a "rapid prototyping" approach.  The system will be                
              capable of identifying out of control conditions, assignable                   
              causes and the necessary corrective action(s) to bring the                     
              process back into control.                                                     
                   The performance and effectiveness of the system will be                   
              validated through simulation based on actual production data.                  
              Various artificial process scenarios will be tested to                         
              investigate the accuracy of the system's diagnostic ability and                
              different types of statistical control charts will also be                     
              investigated.
