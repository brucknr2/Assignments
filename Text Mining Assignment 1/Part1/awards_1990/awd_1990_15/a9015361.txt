Abstract    :
                   On regional and global scales, the emissions of non-methane               
              organic compounds from vegetation, mainly comprised of isoprene                
              and monoterpenes, are comparable to or exceed the emissions of                 
              non-methane organic compounds from anthropogenic sources.  During              
              this three-year experimental program, the PIs will identify and                
              quantify, using atmospheric pressure ionization tandem mass                    
              spectrometry in conjunction with Fourier transform infrared                    
              absorption spectroscopy, gas chromatography and combined gas                   
              chromatography-mass spectrometry, the products formed under                    
              tropospheric conditions from the gas-phase reactions of isoprene               
              and a series of monoterpenes with OH and NO3 radicals and O3.                  
              The product and mechanistic data obtained from this research                   
              program will provide the information necessary for the                         
              formulation of reaction schemes for the tropospheric degradations              
              of these compounds of biogenic origin.  Certain of the product                 
              species formed may serve as "marker" compounds for the                         
              atmospheric transformations of organic compounds emitted by                    
              vegetation.  Accordingly, the PIs will also conduct selected                   
              ambient air studies in carefully chosen locations to investigate               
              whether or not these atmospheric transformation products are                   
              present in the ambient atmosphere.
