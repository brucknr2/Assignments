Abstract    :
              The stabilization of an interconnected power                                   
              system is an important design goal.  This project                              
              deals with this stabilization throughout the use                               
              of decentralized control theory and variable                                   
              structure controllers.  Regulation and static var                              
              device control will be considered.  In addition,                               
              fault tolerance through the use of neural                                      
              network architectures will be used.  Throughout                                
              the project, variable load level and telemetered                               
              data in the presence of noise are considered.
