Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will continue a program to investigate              
              the fundamental physicochemical properties of rock-forming minerals            
              and mineral assemblages. He will measure free energies and                     
              enthalpies of formation of end-member silicates, free energies and             
              enthalpies of mixing in solid solution series, mutual stabilities              
              of important rock-forming mineral assemblages, and stabilities with            
              respect to melting (especially under mixed volatile atmosphere,                
              vapor-undersaturated conditions). Methods to be utilized include               
              oxide melt solution calorimetry, displacement of experimentally                
              determined phase equilibria, determination of cation-exchange                  
              equilibria, and both aqueous and other solubility measurements.                
              This research should add significantly to the data base for                    
              important rock-forming minerals, both in thermodynamic and phase               
              equilibrium terms, and lead to a better understanding of both                  
              mineral-mineral and mineral-liquid equilibria. These data are                  
              critical to geologists who use minerals and mineral assemblages to             
              determine the conditions within the earth under which certain rocks            
              form.
