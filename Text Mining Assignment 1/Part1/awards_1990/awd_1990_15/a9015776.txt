Abstract    :
              This award is being made by the Chemistry Division to enable the               
              participation of 13 younger U.S. scientists in the Bilateral NSF-              
              SERC Joint Workshop on Asymmetric Synthesis which will be held at              
              the Pingree Park facility of Colorado State University, Pingree                
              Park, Colorado, July 3-8, 1990. They will participate in the                   
              Workshop with 12 young scientists from Great Britain. The purposes             
              of the workshop are (1) to expose them to the broader community of             
              international scholarship, and (2) to build long-term bridges for              
              productive international researh collaboration and knowledge                   
              exchange. Asymmetric synthesis has become an area of intensive                 
              research interest and significance in chemistry. The strict                    
              demands placed on the chemical and optical purity of new                       
              marketable drugs makes the discovery and implementation of new and             
              efficient asymmetric chemical constructions a primary concern in               
              chemistry.
