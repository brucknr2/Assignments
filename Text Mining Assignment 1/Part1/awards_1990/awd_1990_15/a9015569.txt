Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will support a second international workshop on                     
              frugivores and seed dispersal to be held at the Estacion                       
              Biologica "Los Tuxtlas" in Veracruz state, Mexico on June 3-                   
              6, 1991.  The workshop is being organized by Prof. Theodore                    
              Fleming of the University of Miami and Prof. Alejandro                         
              Estrada of the Instituto de Biologia of the Universidad                        
              Autonoma de Mexico in Veracruz, Mexico. The activity will                      
              consist of oral presentations, posters sessions, informal                      
              discussions between participants, and explorations of the                      
              rain forest at Los Tuxtlas.  Expected outcomes are a book                      
              consisting of the edited papers given at the workshop and                      
              potential collaborations between U.S. and Latin American                       
              ecologists.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              As was the case five years ago, the topics of the conference-                  
              -fruits, frugivores, and seed dispersal--are of major                          
              ecological concern because they bear importantly on the                        
              conservation of species-rich tropical and subtropical                          
              terrestrial habitats.  In these habitats, many plants produce                  
              fleshy fruits and depend on fruit-eating vertebrates to                        
              disperse their seeds.  This mutualistic interaction is very                    
              complex and the ultimate role played by frugivorous vertebrates                
              in maintaining the structure and diversity of tropical and                     
              subtropical forests is not yet clear.  Periodic assessment of                  
              the progress being made in this field is critical so that                      
              new approaches can be initiated and conservation recom-                        
              mendations formulated.  Personal contacts among established                    
              researchers and graduate students is one way in which the                      
              rate of progress in this field can be maximized.
