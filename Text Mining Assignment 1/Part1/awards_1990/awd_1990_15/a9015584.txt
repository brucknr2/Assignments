Abstract    :
                   Northeast Louisiana University request support from NSF for

              midlevel network located in the southeastern United States.  It                
              will provide operations management and information services and it             
              will give Northeast Louisiana University a 56 thousand bits per                
              second connection the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits              
              per second) National Backbone network.                                         
                   The University needs greater functionality and network speed              
              to be able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file                  
              transfers along with being able to implement a more reliable mail              
              system.  Students and faculty research will benefit from the link.             
              This is also a unique opportunity for the school to explore                    
              innovative educational resources.
