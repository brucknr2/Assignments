Abstract    :
              This research is funded under the Special Initiative on                        
              Coordination Theory and Collaboration Technology.  This is one of              
              eleven winners under that competition.                                         
              The object of this research effort is to exploit a wholly new                  
              interactive window concept, already experimentally implemented in              
              the laboratory, as a basis for construction of flexible new forms of           
              collaboration environments.  These environments will allow                     
              collaborators to work within a shared information space whose                  
              structure adjusts easily to and whose visual form naturally                    
              expresses the inherent structure of their collaboration.  The first            
              stage of this research is to define and implement a basic                      
              collection of functions in an interactive zoomable window system.              
              This system will then be extended across a network, thereby making             
              available a shared information space which will allow an arbitrary             
              number of users to work in a common virtual environment, each                  
              possibly enjoying a different view of this environment.  Then a                
              series of experiments to test the real benefit to collaborators will           
              be conducted.
