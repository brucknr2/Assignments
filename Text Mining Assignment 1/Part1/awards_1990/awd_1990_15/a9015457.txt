              Abstract                                                                        
                  The initial planning phase of the Solar-Terrestrial Energy                
              Program (STEP) is coming to an end with the identification of the              
              first set of research projects.  These projects must now be                    
              integrated into a coherent interdisciplinary program that                      
              focusses on the solar-terrestrial environment as one complex                   
              interactive system. Specific science objectives for the                        
              implementation phase must be defined, and national STEP programs               
              must be combined with the projects identified by the STEP                      
              Steering Committee. This effort will establish an International                
              Science Coordinator Office with the PI acting as the Coordinator               
              during the next two years. These duties include (i) to work with               
              the participating scientific community in the definition of                    
              science objectives and coordination of planning and                            
              implementation of STEP projects; (ii) to produce all major                     
              scientific reports of STEP; (iii) to facilitate the world-wide                 
              promotion of the program, public understanding, and participation              
              of scientists in developing countries; (iv) to participate in                  
              relevant scientific meetings on behalf of STEP.  ***
