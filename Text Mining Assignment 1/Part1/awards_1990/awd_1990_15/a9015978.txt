Abstract    :
              Multi-scale Galerkin methods will be developed for the study of                
              structural/building systems in which the response is characterized             
              by multiple-spatial and multiple-time scales.  For this type of                
              structural problems, the response is often dominated by the middle             
              part of the frequency spectrum, which in this proposal is referred             
              ta as medium frequency dynamic analysis.  New temporal and spatial             
              discretization methods will be developed for the multi-time scale              
              structural dynamic problems.  The concept of fast and slow time                
              scales will be introduced for the temporal discretization.  The                
              required time step is shown to be dependent only on the slow time              
              scale, and therefore, large time step can be used for the high                 
              frequency problems.  To meet the spatial counterpart of the                    
              requirement on time step requirement, finite-spectral elements and             
              finite wave elements will also be developed.  These developed                  
              methods will be applied to building systems, and nonlinear dynamic             
              buckling of fluid-filled shell structures.
