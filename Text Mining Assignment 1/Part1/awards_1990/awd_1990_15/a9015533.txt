Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator studies and develops computational             
              methods suitable for parallel and vector computers to solve                    
              molecular dynamics problems.  He emphasizes time-stepping                      
              techniques to compute motion in many-body interactions, studies the            
              importance of symplectic methods, and investigates strategies for              
              taking larger time steps.  To test the ideas, the principal                    
              investigator implements them in a software package for modeling                
              macromolecules.  The many-body problem-how a set of distinct                   
              objects move under the influence of forces that change as the                  
              objects move-is classical and hard.  For instance, the motion of               
              planets in the solar system can be thought of as a 10 body problem             
              where the primary force is gravity.  The motion of molecules is                
              particularly difficult because such problems involve so many                   
              objects and the nature of the forces is so complicated.                        
              The problems arise in areas of material science, structural                    
              biology, and design of drugs.  This work aims to develop software              
              and algorithms to solve such problems rapidly on computers.
