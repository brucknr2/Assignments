Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal is a continuation of a present GOFS long-lead                    
              time project to test the effectiveness of poisons and                          
              preservatives on preventing the decomposition of organic matter                
              collected in sediment traps.  We have completed three field                    
              tests of this question and concluded that the best treatments                  
              for inhibiting bacterial activity also resulted in the greatest                
              artifact in both flux and organic chemical composition from                    
              swimmers.  In order to exclude swimmers, we have designed a                    
              novel trap with an indented rotating sphere and time-series                    
              capability (IRS).  We propose to test this new trap design in                  
              Dabob Bay, WA, during fall bloom, and at the Hawaii time-series                
              station.  The questions being addressed are:  1) Do detailed                   
              chemical analyses of materials collected in the new IRS                        
              sediment trap indicate that this design excludes swimmers of                   
              all sizes more effectively than conventional open collectors?                  
              2) Are the chemical artifacts resulting from swimmers reduced                  
              sufficiently by the IRS design to finally allow discrimination                 
              between preservation of labile substances in treated traps and                 
              the addition of zooplankton swimmers?  3) Can the IRS traps be                 
              fitted with dependable subsampling carousels for time-series                   
              collections and in-situ experiments?  4) Do the IRS and                        
              carousels-adapted (IRSC) traps perform suitably at all depths                  
              in the open ocean?  5)  Using IRS traps, can we now measure                    
              accurately the vertical fluxes of a wide range of organic                      
              molecules throughout the ocean?  If so, can these data be used                 
              to better define particle dynamics and productivity                            
              relationships?  We anticipate that this new trap will be ready                 
              for use in the planned equatorial Pacific GOFS experiment in                   
              1991/1992.
