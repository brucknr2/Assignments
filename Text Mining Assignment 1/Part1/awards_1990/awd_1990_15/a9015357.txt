Abstract    :
                   It has long been recognized that temperature changes at the               
              earth's surface are propagated into the subsurface but with an                 
              amplitude attenuation and time delay that increase with depth.                 
              Thus corrections to heat flow are sometimes calculated for the                 
              effect of the Pleistocene ice ages, and the effects of the Little              
              Climatic Optimum of the 10th and 11th centuries and the Little                 
              Ice Age of the 17th and 18th centuries may be detected in some                 
              geothermal records.  Many borehole temperature profiles show                   
              changes in the temperature gradient in the uppermost 100m that                 
              may be driven by a secular change of surface temperature over the              
              past century.  The purpose of this project is to enable four                   
              geothermal laboratories (University of Michigan, University of                 
              North Dakota, University of Utah, Southern Methodist University)               
              to interrogate and analyze their respective borehole temperature               
              archives for data relevant to questions of global climate change.              
              These archives contain extensive data from the USA and Africa                  
              south of the equator.
