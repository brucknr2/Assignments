Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  One important aim of Computational Neural Science which                   
              studies information processing brains and adopts neural parallel               
              computational strategies to digital information processing, is to              
              narrow the gap between the high density of neurons and synapses                
              found in brains and the low density in today's computational                   
              models.  In this respect the Connection Machine, a massive parallel            
              computer with a large storage capacity per processor, provides an              
              ideal research tool.  The researchers will exploit this new machine            
              to narrow the gap between current models of the brain and reality.             
              This work will be highly computational in nature, but it will bring            
              together concepts and techniques from disparate disciplines, names             
              Neurobiology, Computer Science, and Computational Physics.
