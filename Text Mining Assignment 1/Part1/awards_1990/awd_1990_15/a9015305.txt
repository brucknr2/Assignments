Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A training and research plan is described for the continued                    
              development and application of an already existing two-                        
              dimensional radiation magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) code to                       
              problems in astrophysics. Applications will be performed for                   
              three important problems: accretion disk dynamics, molecular                   
              cloud collapse during star formation, and the dynamics of the                  
              solar corona.  Planned improvements to the treatment of the                    
              microphysics in the code is expected to produce more realistic                 
              results.  Utilizing the already implemented algorithm for                      
              solving the radiation transfer equation in two-dimensions,                     
              self- consistent radiation intensity maps will be computed                     
              during the course of these simulations for direct comparison                   
              with observations, forming the basis of an interactive                         
              "numerical observatory".  The code will be implemented on a                    
              variety of machines at the NCSA to benchmark the performance                   
              of different architectures on the algorithms for MHD and                       
              radiation transfer. IN particular, the code will be implemented                
              on the massively parallel Connection Machine.
