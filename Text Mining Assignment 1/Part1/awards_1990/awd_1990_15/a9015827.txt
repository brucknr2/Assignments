Abstract    :
              The heavy metal composition of the central nuclear Bulge of our                
              Milky Way Galaxy is important to studies of the types of stars                 
              constituting both external galaxies and the first generation of                
              stars in the disk of our Galaxy.  Currently star formation is                  
              thought to proceed more rapidly in the Bulge than in the                       
              neighborhood of the Sun.  A point of controversy over the last                 
              twenty years has been the question of whether strong absorption                
              lines in the spectra of red giant stars actually reflect an                    
              enhanced abundance of heavy elements, or whether they perhaps arise            
              as a consequence of anomalies in the structures of the atmospheres             
              of these stars.  The Principal Investigator (PI) wishes to conduct             
              research in this area by measuring the abundance of the heavy metal            
              elements in a selected group of Bulge red giants.  This study will             
              differ from those of the past in that high dispersion spectra will             
              be obtained with modern solid state arrays to conduct the abundance            
              analysis.  The results will be used to estimate the mass                       
              distribution of supernovae which return nuclear-processed material             
              into the interstellar medium.  A secondary project will be to                  
              determine whether carbon-star giants (the origin of which is                   
              likewise unclear) in the Bulge have enhanced metal abundances                  
              relative to the Sun's composition.
