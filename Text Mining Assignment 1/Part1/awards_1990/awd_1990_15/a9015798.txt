Abstract    :
                   The objective of the research is to understand the effects of             
              the throat wall and angle of taper on the overall                              
              mixing of flow in the seal chamber of enlarged cylindrical and                 
              tapered mechanical seals.  This research will lead to fundamental              
              understanding of flow behavior in the seal chambers.  As a result              
              of this understanding, new seal chamber design for improved                    
              overall cooling of the seal faces is expected.  In addition, by                
              tracing plastic particles seeded in the flow, the seal chamber                 
              shape will be optimized to reduce the erosive effects of abrasive              
              particles and reduce leakage for pollution control.  Thus, this                
              research will contribute to advancement of pump and mechanical                 
              seal manufacturing technology by providing appropriate means to                
              increase the mean time between failures for these products.
