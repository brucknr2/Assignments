Abstract    :
              Partial support is to be provided for a workshop on future                     
              needs in equipment and facilities for hydraulic research.  One                 
              of the important areas for consideration is mechanics and                      
              transport of sediment, both non-cohesive and cohesive.                         
              Advances in computation and modeling have created a need to                    
              define requirements in instrumentation and facilities in order                 
              for physical data to remain compatible with these advances.                    
                                                                                             
              Sediment accumulation, dredging, run-off, and waste disposal                   
              are examples of sediment and hydraulics management whose                       
              prediction is at present unreliable, and where modern                          
              experimental facilities would have significant impact.
