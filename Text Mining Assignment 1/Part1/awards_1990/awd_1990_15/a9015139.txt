Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Measurement at radio wavelengths is one of the only ways of                    
              studying the solar atmosphere from the ground.  This research                  
              will observe limb brightening, the chromosphere and corona at the              
              eclipse of July 1991 with the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory.               
              These measurements will determine the size of the Sun as observed              
              at a wavelength of 1 millimeter, the sources of thermal emission               
              in the submillimeter range, and there will be a search for a                   
              variety of spectral features in both the chromosphere and the                  
              corona.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              These measurements will allow one to determine the temperature                 
              structure of the low solar atmosphere and will show temperature                
              differences between different regions on the Sun such as                       
              filaments and sunspots.  Spectral features such as recombination               
              lines, if found, should give information on the velocity of                    
              matter in the corona and the chromosphere.  Some information on                
              chemical abundances in these regions should also be obtained.                  
                                                                                             
              The Principal Investigator is an expert in observational solar                 
              physics and instrumentation.
