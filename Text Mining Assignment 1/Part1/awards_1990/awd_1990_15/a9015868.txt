Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research is aimed at fundamental questions regarding the                  
              oxidation behavior and structure of aluminum-lithium alloys.  In               
              the process  of examining these alloys, new characterization                   
              techniques are developed in the use of Secondary Ion Mass                      
              Spectrometry (SIMS).  Specific areas being addressed include:                  
              (1) oxidation behavior of aluminum-lithium alloys with emphasis                
              on  nucleation of the oxide, growth phenomena, and lithium                     
              depletion; (2) lithium diffusion and solute redistribution in                  
              the alloys; and (3) structural and chemical characterization of                
              intermetallic phases in the alloys.  This research is pertinent                
              to further development of this important class of metal alloys,                
              and the characterization techniques being developed are generic                
              to all materials.  The program is a collaborative research                     
              effort involving the Universities of Chicago and Lehigh and the                
              National Institute of Standards.
