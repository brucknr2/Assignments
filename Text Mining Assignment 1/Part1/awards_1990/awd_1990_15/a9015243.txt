Abstract    :
                   The goal of this infrastructure enhancement project is to increase        
              the n umber of minority students who go on to graduate school in               
              Computer Science.  This two-year project is the first phase to the             
              development of a full institutional infrastructure program at the              
              University of Maryland - Eastern Shore.  The project will focus on:            
                   o  Installation of a Department Ethernet                                  
                   o  Enhancement of a PC Laboratory                                         
                   o  Acquisition of several Workstations                                    
                   o  Expansion of an Advisory Committee                                     
                   o  Faculty summer support                                                 
                   o  Faculty travel and consultation
