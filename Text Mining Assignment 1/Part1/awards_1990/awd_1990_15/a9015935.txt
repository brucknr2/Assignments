Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports the First Buenos Aires Workshop on                         
              Analytical Chemistry to be held in Buenos Aires, Argentina                     
              from November 12-16, 1990.  The organizer is Daniel Batistoni                  
              of the analytical chemistry department of the Argentine Atomic                 
              Energy Commission.  The U.S. organizer is Ramon Barnes of the                  
              University of Massachusetts.  The aim of this workshop is to                   
              bring together local and international scientists active in                    
              different fields of analytical chemistry.  Exchange of ideas                   
              and discussions will be stressed between research units,                       
              government laboratories and industry.  The program will                        
              include plenary lectures, invited oral presentations on                        
              selected topics, and oral or poster presentations of                           
              contributed papers.  The workshop also includes discussion                     
              panels on specific subjects, four tutorial lectures, and a                     
              limited instrumental exhibition.  It will stimulate the                        
              initiation of new professional contacts and long term                          
              associations between U.S. and Latin American scientists who                    
              share common research interests.                                               
                                                                                             
              The proposed research-oriented program is focused on modern                    
              topics in analytical chemistry including instrumental                          
              analysis techniques; flow injection and kinetic methods of                     
              analysis; quality assurance; toxicology, biological, and                       
              environmental analysis; and the analysis of materials.  The                    
              workshop will promote scientific exchange and collaboration                    
              in the specific areas of advanced spectroscopic techniques                     
              for elemental analysis at trace and ultratrace levels as                       
              applied to the characterization of new materials; flow                         
              injection and kinetic methods of analysis, and quality                         
              control in analytical laboratories.
