Abstract    :
              This award will support Professor Athanassios Fokas of                         
              Clarkson University in a research collaboration with Professor                 
              Paolo Santini of the Universita degli Studi di Roma, "La                       
              Sapienza", Italy.  The researchers intend to work on a                         
              variety of topics including the direct linearization of a                      
              class of nonlinear evolution equations, limits from the                        
              intermediate long wave equation to the Benjamin-Ono equation,                  
              recursion operators and bi-Hamiltonian and coherent structures                 
              in multidimensions.                                                            
                                                                                             
              The collaborators have a history of successful interaction,                    
              which has led to some of the best current work on the                          
              analysis of integrable non-linear evolution equators.  The                     
              mathematics is important and has potential applications to                     
              physics and engineering.
