Abstract    :
              This Conference on Ethics in Engineering Education, scheduled for              
              June 1990, takes advantage of recent interest and advances in                  
              course development, research and professional society initiatives.             
              The conference will gather 20 participants, representing                       
              engineering and engineering ethics educators, practicing engineers,            
              and engineering societies.  In discussions stimulated by prepared              
              presentations as well as prior distribution of short reports of                
              relevant work, participants will aim to identify and examine the               
              core concepts and skills which students should develop from their              
              exposure to engineering ethics.  Conference participants would also            
              aim to identify effective techniques and the expertise teachers                
              need to communicate these concepts and skills.  The conference will            
              generate a report for all deans of engineering schools and                     
              directors of engineering programs.                                             
                                                                                             
              This project focuses on important and timely issues in ethics and              
              undergraduate engineering education.  The investigator and                     
              participants are highly qualified; the institutional sponsor is                
              appropriate; the results are likely to be of wide interest and                 
              broadly disseminated.  The project is strongly recommended for an              
              award.
