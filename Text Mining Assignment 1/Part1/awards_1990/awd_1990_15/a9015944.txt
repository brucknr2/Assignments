Abstract    :
                   The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL)             
              will plan and conduct, under National Science Foundation sponsorship,          
              a comprehensive assessment and information dissemination project of            
              innovative computer applications judged to be most effective in                
              helping people with disabilities.  Called the Second National Search           
              for Computer Applications for Persons with Disabilities, the project           
              is modeled on a similar search and assessment conducted in 1980-1981           
              which uncovered over 900 inventions involving personal computer aids           
              for person with disabilities.  The primary objectives of this search           
              and assessment effort are:                                                     
                   (1) To heighten the nations awareness and sensitivity to the              
              problems and needs of disabled persons and how computers can provide           
              new opportunities for people with disabilities.                                
                   (2)  To identify effective adaptive technology, i.e., computer            
              applications and techniques, and to stimulate creative developments            
              to improve the quality of life of people with disabilities.                    
                   (3)  To document and disseminate information on effective                 
              computer applications to persons with disabilities, interested                 
              educators, researchers, and the computer industry.                             
                   This project will address a wide spectrum of disabilities and             
              take the form of a series of competitions.  Entries from                       
              professionals, amateurs, and students, addressing visual, hearing,             
              language, neuromuscular, and learning disabilities, will be judged             
              first regionally, then nationally to select the most effective                 
              applications.  Local and national winners will receive awards.                 
              Information on effective computer applications will be disseminated            
              to the disabled community and to interested researchers and                    
              commercial organizations.  A long-term task force will be established          
              to continue efforts to transfer computer technology to serve the               
              needs of persons with disabilities
