Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The work is designed to provide a method by                                    
              which differential soil movement can be                                        
              predicted in expansive soils beneath slab-on-                                  
              grade foundation influenced by climate.  Its                                   
              ultimate objective is to mitigate structural                                   
              damage resulting from expansive soil                                           
              movement.  The work plan consist of                                            
              theoretical, laboratory and field studies,                                     
              and will continue the field measurements                                       
              obtained during a recently completed research                                  
              project.  Monthly measurements will be made                                    
              of soil moisture content, soil suction,                                        
              surface elevation and depth of shrink/heave,                                   
              and the long-term development of the                                           
              distorted shape of swelling soil beneath                                       
              slabs will be measured and compared with that                                  
              predicted by a model developed from the field                                  
              data acquired from the previous study.  These                                  
              results of the work will elucidate and relate                                  
              soil differential movement as a function of                                    
              climate, soil suction and clay mineralogy                                      
              with actual measured field values.
