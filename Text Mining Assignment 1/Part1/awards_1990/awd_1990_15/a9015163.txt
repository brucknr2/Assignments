Abstract    :
              This proposal requests funds to permit Dr. Wendell Horton,                     
              Professor of Physics, University of Texas at Austin, to                        
              pursue with Dr. Duk-In Choi, Professor of Physics, Korea                       
              Advanced Institute of Science and Technology  (KAIST), for a                   
              period of 24 months, a program of cooperative research on                      
              the basic theoretical physics aspects of plasma dynamics.                      
              This research  will deal especially with the effect of small                   
              scale fluctuations of the drift wave type on the magnetic                      
              confinement of plasmas.  The researchers  will use analytic                    
              theory and numerical simulations to determine the nature of                    
              the electron and ion particle transport in the system.  The                    
              role of the electron temperature gradient in driving short                     
              wavelength magnetic fluctuations will be emphasized.                           
                                                                                             
              The research is directly motivated by unresolved issues in                     
              the controlled fusion program, but results of the research                     
              will be relevant to basic processes occurring in stellar,                      
              magnetospheric, and astrophysical plasmas.  The U.S. and                       
              Korean collaborators are highly respected scientists who not                   
              only have extensive research experience and  productive                        
              publication records in the field of the proposal but also                      
              have produced more than 20 joint publications from past                        
              collaboration which includes collaboration under NSF Grant                     
              No. INT-8617403.  This project is relevant to the objectives                   
              of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science Program which seeks to                   
              increase the level of cooperation between  U.S. and Korean                     
              scientists and engineers through the exchange of scientific                    
              information, ideas, skills, and techniques and through                         
              collaboration on problems of mutual benefit.  Korean                           
              participation in the project is supported by the Korea                         
              Science and Engineering Foundation  (KOSEF).
