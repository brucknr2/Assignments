Abstract    :
              This proposal requests funds for the purchase of a high                        
              performance, high field, instrument (500 MHz for proton                        
              observation) that will be dedicated to macromolecular structure                
              determination.  It will serve a small group of investigators in                
              the chemistry department of Yale University who have ongoing                   
              projects directed at structure elucidation of biological                       
              macromolecules.                                                                
                                                                                             
              These projects span a range of subjects that include DNA and RNA               
              binding proteins, proteins and nucleic acids important in                      
              ribosome function, proteins important in lipid biosynthesis, and               
              molecules important to cell surface recognition.
