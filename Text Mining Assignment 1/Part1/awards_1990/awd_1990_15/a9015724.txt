Abstract    :
                   This award will provide partial support to a group of                     
              physicists at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, Berkeley CA,                   
              who are members of the Berkeley Particle Date Center,                          
              Headquarters of the International Particle Data Group.  The                    
              primary task of the center is to provide researchers with                      
              compiled and evaluated information on particle properties and                  
              related areas.  This information is made available to about                    
              twenty thousand researchers, teachers and students through the                 
              biennial publication of the "Review of Particle Properties" and                
              the "Particle Properties Data Booklet."  The Center also                       
              produces other compilations of value to particle physicists:                   
              "Major Detectors in Elementary Particle Physics"; "Current                     
              Experiments in Elementary Particle Physics" and "Guide to Data                 
              in Elementary Particle Physics".
