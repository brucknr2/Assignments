Abstract    :
              Research on submicron particles and related technologies is                    
              one  of the areas in which the PMP program will be focused in                  
              the next two years.  Despite its importance in several new                     
              industrial processes and in nature, several basic phenomena                    
              are not yet well understood and modeled.  Dr. D.T. Shaw                        
              (SUNY/Buffalo), in collaboration with D.Y.H. Pui (University                   
              of Minnesota) and R.C. Flagan (Caltech), will organize a                       
              workshop on the state of the art and research needs in                         
              submicron particle study.  The meeting will be held at NSF,                    
              for two days.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              The workshop will provide a forum to establish future research                 
              trends.  The written report will be distributed to                             
              universities and  research centers involved in submicron                       
              studies.
