Abstract    :
              Principal Investigator proposed to study the uncertainty in                    
              imperfections in viscoelastic plates, and their effects on                     
              buckling.  The main objective is to investigate the feasibility of             
              convex modeling - a new concept of uncertainty in imperfection                 
              sensitivity analysis.  Comparison will be made against classical               
              techniques of stochastic analysis.  Both static and dynamic                    
              buckling are to be considered.
