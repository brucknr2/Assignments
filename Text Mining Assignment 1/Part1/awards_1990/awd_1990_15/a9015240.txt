Abstract    :
              The evolution of massive stars is a key topic in astrophysics.                 
              The subject is important for several reasons, among them to                    
              determine the chemical evolution of galaxies, to set up distance               
              indicators ("standard candles") in nearby galaxies, to determine               
              the energetics of the interstellar medium, and to understand the               
              recent "starburst" phenomenon in distant galaxies.   The Principal             
              Investigator (PI) proposes to continue work in this area by                    
              continuing recently initiated work on massive "O" stars in our                 
              Galaxy to external galaxies.  This work would include a                        
              determination of brightnesses and temperatures of stars (an "H-R               
              Diagram") for star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds and other                 
              nearby galaxies and the use of "Wolf-Rayet" stars (evolved massive             
              stars with strong spectral emission lines) to trace the regions of             
              recent star formation.   Finally, the PI plans to investigate the              
              properties of the galaxies in order to understand the occurrence               
              of recently formed massive stars in them.  This work is expected               
              to add to our understanding of the conditions under which                      
              individual stars are formed in our Galaxy as well as the evolution             
              of the "demographics" of stars in galaxies after they have been                
              formed.
