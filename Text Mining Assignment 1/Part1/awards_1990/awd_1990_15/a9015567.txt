Abstract    :
                   The Ohio Academic Resources Network (OARnet) is the NSF mid-              
              level network that serves the State of Ohio.  A primary goal of                
              OARnet is to facilitate collaborative projects and sharing of                  
              resources between institutions, including those outside the state.             
              OARnet connections are available to Ohio academic institutions                 
              engaged in research or instruction.  OARnet intends to eventually              
              connect all educational institutions in Ohio.  This award funds                
              establishment of five connections and upgrades one connection to a             
              TCP/IP capability.
