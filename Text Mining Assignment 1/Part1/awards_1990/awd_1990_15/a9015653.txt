Abstract    :
                   The objective of this research is to design and implement a               
              Flexible Computer Integrated Manufacturing (FCIM) work-cell for the            
              assembly of an Automatic Braking System.  The brake system may use             
              the FCIM concept in automating the assembly process of one of its              
              subsystems, the Actuator Unit, by incorporating the design for                 
              automated manufacturing concept.  The FCIM work-cell will contain              
              robots, a looped conveyor, vision system, sensors, and controlling             
              computers.  The research includes the justification for                        
              the use of an FCIM work-cell, the study of the changeover time from            
              one model to the other, the reuse of equipment, material handling              
              and the ability to use multiple vendors.
