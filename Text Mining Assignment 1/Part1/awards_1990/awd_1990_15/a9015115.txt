Abstract    :
              This research is on design for testability (DFT), and associated               
              test generation algorithms for clocked synchronous circuits.  The              
              research approach is to partition the flip-flops into tow groups,              
              each controllable by its own independent clock line in the test                
              mode.  The result is the decomposition of the original state                   
              machine into two communicating submachines, with flip-flops grouped            
              so as to simplify the test generation process.  Flip-flop                      
              partitioning is stated in terms of a graph representation of flip-             
              flop connectivity.  A two clock decomposition algorithm is being               
              implemented.  In test generation, existing test generators are                 
              being adapted to serve as an early proof of the DFT scheme.  Also,             
              a test generation algorithm, based on a two dimensional                        
              generalization of the standard time frame expansion is being                   
              implemented and tested against benchmark circuits.
