Abstract    :
                   The research will develop and experimentally evaluate a                   
              sensor-based fault diagnostic method for helicopter drive trains.              
              This method is based on an approach designed to cope with the                  
              variability and overlap of fault signatures, two major sources of              
              difficulty for the existing diagnostic systems.  This approach                 
              employs vectors of fault signatures in its diagnostic model;                   
              therefore, it can tolerate the overlap between individual                      
              signatures and, since it adjusts its diagnostic model in-process,              
              it can cope with fault signature variations.  This approach uses               
              a multi-valued influence matrix (MVIM) as its diagnostic model with            
              the columns representing the "average" values of the fault                     
              signatures.  The MVIM approach can assess the diagnosability of the            
              system with it s available measurements, select an optimal subset              
              of measurements subject to the diagnosability constraint, perform              
              on-line diagnostic reasoning, and update it diagnostic model                   
              (influence matrix) in response to process variations.                          
                   The research will include (1) a detailed review of the current            
              state of the art techniques for fault signature identification of              
              power train systems, (2) a study of the available data on power                
              train failure for possible tailoring of the MVIM method for a                  
              feasibility study, (3) development of a feasibility demonstration              
              plan to support and justify a more extensive validation program,               
              and (4) analysis of the results of the feasibility test to further             
              modify the theory and develop a plan to fully validate the                     
              methodology.//
