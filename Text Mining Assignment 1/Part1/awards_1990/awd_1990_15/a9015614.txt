Abstract    :
              This project is a study of organic bromine chemistry in the lower              
              arctic atmosphere, particularly in relation to tropospheric                    
              destruction of ozone.  It has been observed that shortly after the             
              arctic sunrise, surface ozone concentrations decline from a late               
              winter maximum to near zero before recovering to moderately high               
              summer values.  There is also strong evidence which implies that               
              the primary cause for the minimum is the photolytic production of              
              bromine radicals from organic bromine gases, which then combine                
              with ozone.  The chemical pathways are conjectural and little is               
              known about the origins of the organic bromine, but it is believed             
              that a marine source is the most probable.  This study addresses               
              the former question through a field program at Resolute, N.W.T.,               
              Canada, to collect and analyze atmospheric particulate bromine and             
              both inorganic and organic gaseous bromine, as well as other                   
              halogens (chlorine and iodine) to assess their possible                        
              contributions to tropospheric chemistry during the arctic spring.              
              Supporting ozone and meteorological variables are measured                     
              routinely at the Barrow Observatory of the Geophysical Monitoring              
              for Climatic Change Program of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric            
              Administration.  The complementary effort to collect and analyze               
              headspace gases from incubated arctic macrophyte, phytoplankton,               
              ice algae, and other samples is included in a separately funded                
              action.
