Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This renewal proposal is aimed at a study of elementary                        
              photochemical reactions at low temperatures (10-80 K) using thermal            
              desorption and vibrational and electronic electron energy loss                 
              spectroscopies, and photon induced desorption mass spectrometry.               
              Reactions to be studied include the photo-oxidation and photo-                 
              reduction of carbon monoxide and ethylene coadsorbed with oxygen               
              and hydrogen sulfide on silver (110) and platinum (111).
