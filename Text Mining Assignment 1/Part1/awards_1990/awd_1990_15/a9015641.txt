Abstract    :
                   Research is in the area of materials engineering and                      
              manufacturing processes aimed at acquiring in-depth knowledge of               
              basic physical phenomena in Czochralski (CZ) crystal growth                    
              equipment processes, major scientific and engineering                          
              considerations in computer-aided design and manufacturing of an                
              automated "one button control" puller, cost consideration, and                 
              United States competitiveness in world market for CZ crystal                   
              puller.  Preliminary research will be performed on                             
              continuously-charged Czochralski (CCZ) growth of silicon single                
              crystals.  The CCZ process is expected to produce crystals of                  
              uniform properties, better quality and lesser costs.  The research             
              on CCZ process will include theoretical work in order to make                  
              modifications in the conventional CZ crystal puller for                        
              experiments, and develop a basic understanding of flow and                     
              temperature fields in the melt.  Experiments to obtain data on                 
              crucible size, melt height, power requirement, growth and feed                 
              rates, appropriate location for addition of silicon charge and                 
              several other parameters which help in developing a commercial                 
              unit will be investigated.
