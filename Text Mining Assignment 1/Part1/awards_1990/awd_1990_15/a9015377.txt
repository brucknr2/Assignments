Abstract    :
              The purpose of this project is to develop a numerical                          
              technique for large-scale simulation of particle motion in                     
              suspension with negligible inertial effects.  The governing                    
              Stokes equations are transformed into a set of Fredholm                        
              integral equations of second kind with double-layer densities                  
              on the surface of particles and on the boundary of the system.                 
              A fast iterative algorithm which makes optimal use of parallel                 
              computer architectures is proposed.  The technique can be                      
              applied to dilute and concentrate suspension flow, non-                        
              spherical particles and irregularly bounding walls.                            
                                                                                             
              It is expected that the research results will provide                          
              numerical tools for other researchers in the field of                          
              suspension flow, and will be used to interpret various                         
              experiments.
