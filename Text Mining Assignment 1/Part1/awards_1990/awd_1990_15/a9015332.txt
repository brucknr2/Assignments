Abstract    :
                   A large detector array to be utilized in exclusive                        
              quasifree scattering experiments will be constructed.  The goal                
              of these measurements is to obtain information about the degree                
              to which the nucleon-nucleon interaction is modified when one                  
              of the nucleons is embedded inside the nucleus.
