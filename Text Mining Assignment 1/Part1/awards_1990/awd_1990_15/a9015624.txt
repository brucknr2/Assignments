Abstract    :
              This project enhances the state of the art in electromagnetic                  
              geophysical tomography, an adaptation of Computerized Axial                    
              Tomography (CAT) used successfully in medical diagnosis.                       
              Geophysical tomography, based on mechanical waves, has been used               
              to study rectangular regions up to 1000 meters on a side, as well              
              as to analyze deep earth structures.  Sources have included                    
              airguns, explosives and earthquake data.  The method's capabilities            
              have been augmented using geophones, called seismic cones, to                  
              detect the arrival of artificially generated waves to determine                
              geophysical characteristics.  This approach is referred to as the              
              seismic source cone penetration test (SS-CPT).  However, the                   
              seismic cones have several limitations.  This research proposes                
              evaluation of a method to address these limitations.  This field               
              evaluation will take place at well documented sites in California              
              where extensive geotechnical investigations have already been                  
              performed to establish site stratification.
