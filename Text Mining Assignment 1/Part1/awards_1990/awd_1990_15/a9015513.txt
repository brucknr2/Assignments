Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award provides partial support for the Federation of Latin                
              American Physical Societies.  The principal investigator for the               
              U.S. is Leon Lederman of Fermilab and his counterpart is Gil da                
              Costa Marques, President of the Brazilian Physical Society,                    
              President of the Federation and a professor at the University of               
              Sao Paulo.  Members of the Federation include Argentina, Bolivia,              
              Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Chile, Ecuador, Honduras,                  
              Mexico, Peru and Venezuela.  The first meeting will be in July,                
              1990 with major meetings every year and those in each third year               
              expanded into a Pan American Symposium.                                        
                                                                                             
              The U.S. has extensive connections and collaborations in physics               
              throughout Latin America.  It is clearly in our interest to                    
              encourage activities which will strengthen the infrastructure of               
              science in developing countries as well as our bilateral agreement             
              partners.  This Federation will improve the level of interaction               
              in physics among the members and with the American Physical                    
              Society.  The improvement will enhance communications and the                  
              sharing of facilities as well as scientific ideas and the study of             
              physics.
