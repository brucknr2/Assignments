Abstract    :
              Dr. Ilan Benjamin is supported by a grant from the Theoretical                 
              and Computational Chemistry Program to perform molecular                       
              dynamics simulations of chemical reactions at liquid                           
              interfaces.  This is fundamentally important since in many                     
              chemical systems the interesting and relevant chemistry occurs                 
              at the interface between two immiscible liquids, at the                        
              liquid-solid interface, or at the liquid-vapor interface.                      
                                                                                             
              Dr. Benjamin plans to study the effect of the media on chemical                
              reactions which occur at the interface between a liquid and its                
              vapor, and at the interface between two immiscible liquids.                    
              The method of molecular dynamics computer simulation will be                   
              used to find how the unique characteristics of the interface                   
              affect the equilibrium properties of a chemically reactive                     
              system, such as the solvation free energy, the equilibrium                     
              constant, the activation free energy and thus the transition-                  
              state-theory rate constant.  A major part of the study will use                
              non-equilibrium molecular dynamics to investigate the influence                
              of the solvent on time-dependent properties of the chemically                  
              reactive species at the interface.  This includes energy decay,                
              barrier crossings, solvent fluctuations caused by the presence                 
              of the solute and their effects on the rate of reaction.
