Abstract    :
              Electron microscope tomography (EMT) is the method of                          
              computational reconstruction of the 3-D electron density of an                 
              ultrastructural specimen for combined projections around a tilt                
              axis.  The investigators have emphasized analysis of stained                   
              plastic-embedded sections tilted around a single axis,                         
              representing a logical extension of much of conventional                       
              biological transmission electron microscopy.  Performing EMT on                
              thick sections is an important application of this method,                     
              especially when dealing with the large-scale organization of                   
              cellular organelles.  The investigators will continue to analyze               
              thick sections imaged with inelastically-scattered electrons and               
              to examine mass-loss (specimen-damage) by electron spectroscopy.               
              The group will also focus its efforts on volume rendering to                   
              develop a consensus structure of the organization of DNA                       
              transcription in vivo, and it develop techniques for preparations              
              of tomographic analysis.
