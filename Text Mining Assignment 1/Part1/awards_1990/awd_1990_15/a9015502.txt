Abstract    :
              Pultruded fiber reinforced plastic (FRP) structural shapes are                 
              beginning to see use in Civil Engineering practice.  The design and            
              performance of pultruded FRP structures is considered in this                  
              research.  Particular attention is paid to the influence of the                
              transverse properties of the anisotropic pultruded material on the             
              structural response.                                                           
                                                                                             
              Experimental and theoretical techniques will be used to obtain                 
              nonlinear moment-rotation data and failure information for typical             
              pultruded FRP connections; and buckling, postbuckling and failure              
              data for transversely loaded pultruded FRP beams.  The use of FRP              
              stiffeners will be considered as a means of improving performance              
              of pultruded structures.                                                       
                                                                                             
              The recommendations will be transmitted to the Civil Engineering               
              community and the pultrusion industry through an ASTM committee.
