Abstract    :
              This award supports cooperative research between                               
              George Bertsch of Michigan State University and                                
              Dr. M. Hussein of the University of Sao Paulo,                                 
              Brazil.  The principal investigators will study the                            
              theory of nuclear reactions, with applications to                              
              phenomena under experimental investigation.  In the                            
              past, they have made studies in parallel but                                   
              completely independently.  Both Bertsch and Hussein                            
              have calculated gamma decays of giant resonances;                              
              both the Michigan State and the Sao Paulo groups are                           
              now studying fragmentation reactions related to the                            
              properties of exotic nuclei.                                                   
                                                                                             
              It will be productive to continue this work in                                 
              collaboration to take advantage of MSU's facilities                            
              and close connections in both the theory and                                   
              experimental communities.  One of the                                          
              collaborations, to study pion production from exotic                           
              beams, has already started.  The aim is relying on                             
              the experience of both sides on the agreement in                               
              nuclear structure and reaction theories and to develop                         
              a consistent and practical theory for the decay of                             
              the giant resonances.
