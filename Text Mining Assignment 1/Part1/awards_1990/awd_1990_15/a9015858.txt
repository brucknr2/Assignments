Abstract    :
                   This project in mathematical physics will carry out                       
              research in three different areas:  asymptotics for the path                   
              integral when no stationary action point exists; quantum                       
              measurement theory; spectral analysis of the Master equation                   
              generator and applications to neural networks.
