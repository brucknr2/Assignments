Abstract    :
              This research is funded under the Special Initiative on Coordination           
              Theory and Collaboration Technology.  This is one of eleven winners            
              under that competition.                                                        
              This research is directed towards integrating concepts from                    
              artificial intelligence, organization theory, and operations                   
              research into a single framework.  The research argument is that the           
              plans, organizations, and schedules studies in these separate fields           
              can share a common representation, and are simply different                    
              abstractions of a behavioral specification.  The PI develops a                 
              hierarchical, multi-dimensional specification for behavior that                
              subsumes traditional goal, plan, functional and product hierarchies.           
              the research outlines a protocol for coordination based on the                 
              behavioral specification, where intelligent agents incrementally               
              exchange behavioral information and search through alternative                 
              behaviors to resolve conflicts and promote cooperation.  The                   
              research also implements and evaluates this framework both in the              
              context of cooperative robotics domain, and in the context of an               
              intelligent systems for scheduling meetings between people.  The               
              objective is to generate scientific and technological advances using           
              a novel, interdisciplinary approach to coordination.
