Abstract    :
              This research has the purpose of obtaining new information on the              
              dynamics of high frequency phonons using powerful far infrared                 
              phonon generation techniques coupled with sensitive and tunable                
              optical detection methods.  A second project involves the study                
              of optical dephasing and spectral diffusion using a variety of                 
              techniques probing a wide range of time scales.  Far infrared                  
              defect-induced one-phonon absorption permits generation of a                   
              tunable monoenergetic phonon distribution, which when combined with            
              tunable detection employing vibronic sideband phonon spectroscopy,             
              will permit truly time-resolved phonon spectroscopy.  This                     
              spectroscopy will be used to study anharmonic phonon-phonon                    
              interactions responsible for phonon breakup and phonon                         
              recombination.  The optical dephasing studies will utilize methods             
              in both the time and frequency domain.  Of special interest are the            
              effects of different time scales for the determination of                      
              homogeneous line width.  These results will be analyzed with                   
              stochastic models for the dephasing due to electron spin-spin and              
              electron-nuclear spin interactions.  Computer simulations will also            
              be developed.
