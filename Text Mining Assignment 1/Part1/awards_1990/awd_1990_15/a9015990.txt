Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project supports a graduate student in cultural anthropology              
              who is studying the cognitive structure of emotions in a rural                 
              area of Indonesia.  Studies have shown that cognition depends on               
              organized structures of information, called "schemas".  Little is              
              known of how children learn such schemas.  This project will                   
              explore how schemas develop in the process of acquisition by                   
              children, how children's use of them changes, and how children                 
              acquire them through social interaction.  Methods will involve                 
              direct observation and in-depth interviews.                                    
                                                                                             
              This research is important because comparative cases and analyses              
              of how children learn cognitive elements will give us material                 
              useful in helping us understand how to deal with deficits and                  
              abnormalities in this critical procedure.
