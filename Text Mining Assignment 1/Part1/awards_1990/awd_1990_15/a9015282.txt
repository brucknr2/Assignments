Abstract    :
                   Coordinate Measurement Machines (CMM) and more recently,                  
              Optical Coordinate Measuring Machines (OCCM) are gaining rapid                 
              acceptance in U.S. industry, particularly the automotive                       
              industry, because of its high-speed capability of dimensional                  
              measurement.  If properly applied, CMM, and OCMMs can be used to               
              dramatically improve product quality by enabling accurate and                  
              inexpensive 100% in-process measurement and continuously                       
              monitoring the manufacturing processes thus providing a way to                 
              process improvement. This is an essential step in retaining U.S.               
              competitiveness in the world. The need for such a center was                   
              evidenced by the industrial support generated during the planning              
              grant phase (ECD 9015282) of the center development.  Today there              
              are over 100 different companies marketing these systems in the                
              U.S. and over the next decade the annual sales should exceed $1.2              
              billion.                                                                       
                   The Industry/University Cooperative Research Center on                    
              Coordinate Measuring Machines and Optical Coordinate Measuring                 
              Machines at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor will perform               
              research on the use and application of CMMs and OCCMs in                       
              improving quality of products, particularly those related to the               
              automotive industry.                                                           
                   The Program Manager recommends that the University of                     
              Michigan at Ann Arbor be awarded $50,000 for the first year of a               
              five year continuing grant.                                                    
                   Near the end of each twelve month period, the Program                     
              Manager and/or the Directors of the Engineering Centers Division               
              reviews the progress of the center on a number of renewal                      
              criteria, including the following: (1) extent to which the                     
              Industry/University interaction and collaboration is developing;               
              (2) extent to which the support base for the center is expanding;              
              (3) extent to which a robust research program is developing.  If               
              the review is satisfactory, the Program Manager will recommend                 
              support of the next period of this continuing grant.
