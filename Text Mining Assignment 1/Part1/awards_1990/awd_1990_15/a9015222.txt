Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Recently developed analytical and computational methods will be                
              utilized to calculate the equilibrium atomic positions, charge                 
              densities, total energies and the electronic structure of systems              
              with very large unit cells.  Specific applications will include                
              boron and its compounds which are of scientific interest because of            
              their unique icosahedrally based crystal structures and of                     
              technological interest because of their hardness, lightness, and               
              thermoelectric properties.  A second large unit cell system to be              
              investigated will be II-VI/III-V semiconductor superlattices.  Work            
              will also be undertaken to speed up ab initio molecular dynamics               
              calculations.
