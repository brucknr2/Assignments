Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              The purpose of this project is to analyze and define the                       
              Huasteca region in light of new archaeological                                 
              developments in other Mesoamerican regions.  Among these                       
              are the increased archaeological activities in Central                         
              Mexico; developments in Veracruz with respect to the                           
              Olmec; the intensive and extensive studies in Oaxaca; and                      
              the great development of new cultural interpretations for                      
              the Maya region. Few studies have been done in this region                     
              since the 1920's.  The investigator proposes to complete a                     
              survey of recorded and reported sites for a subsequent                         
              selection, testing and excavation.  The testing or                             
              excavation of sites will locate those with preclassic                          
              components. He will attempt to relate the Huastec with the                     
              Maya culture through material remains and perhaps through                      
              the manifestations of belief systems or practices.  The                        
              next step will be to analyze the changes in the Huastec as                     
              they become part of the central Mexican sphere of                              
              influence.  An additional effort will be put forth to                          
              understand the relationship between Spaniards and Indians                      
              at the time of conquest and in the early colonial period.                      
              This analysis will be pursued from an archaeological                           
              perspective in an attempt to see how rapidly change                            
              occurred in this region.
