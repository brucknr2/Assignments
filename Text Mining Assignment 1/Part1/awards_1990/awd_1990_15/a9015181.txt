Abstract    :
              This award is for a study of the relationship of the morphology of             
              galaxies to their interactions and associations.  Both continuum               
              radio radiation and the 21 cm line of neutral hydrogen will be                 
              utilized to investigate galaxies int he local supercluster and                 
              beyond.  The principle investigator is a leading expert in this                
              field, and will allow a number of undergraduates at his institution            
              to participate in this research, offering them an unusual                      
              opportunity to enhance their education.
