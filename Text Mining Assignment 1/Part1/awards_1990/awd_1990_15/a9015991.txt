Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Virtually every animal and plant species exhibits genetic                      
              variation for a variety of enzymes involved in the control of                  
              metabolism.  Only a few studies have clearly established the                   
              relationships among genetic variation for a specific enzyme                    
              (genotype), the mechanistic, biochemical expression of that                    
              variation, a nd its relevance to the physiology and phenotype of               
              the whole organism.  A more integrated approach to examine the                 
              biological significance of genetic variation for a single enzyme               
              involves detailing the effects of that variation on the overall                
              rate of energy flow through the metabolic pathway in which the                 
              enzyme is embedded.  The proposed research will use this approach              
              to attempt to establish a causal explanation for observations for              
              a strong relationship between genetic variation for a specific                 
              enzyme and production-related traits in the bay scallop.  The                  
              proposed mechanism which explains these observations involves the              
              genotype-dependent inhibition of the energy flow through the                   
              specific enzyme step and its associated metabolic pathway caused               
              by demands for increased energy flow through a competing pathway.              
              The proposed research will examine the expression of genetic                   
              variation at this enzyme step by using radioisotopes to measure                
              the rates of flow through this enzyme as well as through its                   
              overall pathway when the enzyme is artificially inhibited with a               
              product from the competing pathway.  The results will be                       
              significance in areas as diverse as evolutionary biology and                   
              biochemistry to those concerned with the significance of genetic               
              variation to economically important traits such as aquaculture                 
              and agriculture.
