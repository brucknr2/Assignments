Abstract    :
                   Many-body QED calculations on atomic systems will be                      
              carried out using a Green's function technique.  Radiative                     
              corrections will be treated perturbatively for low Z atoms.                    
              The zeroth order approximation to be used is the Dirac-Fock                    
              approximation.  Analytical approximations will be obtained                     
              using perturbation theory, but the final results must be                       
              obtained by numerical computations.
