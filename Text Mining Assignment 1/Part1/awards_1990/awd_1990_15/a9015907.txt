Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The molecular order in thin films of surfactant solutions on                   
              solid surfaces will differ from that in bulk solutions.  The                   
              unique features of the ordering may include the self-assembly                  
              of monolayers on the bounding interfaces, the induction of new                 
              liquid crystalline order in the film, and the ordering of                      
              macromolecular assemblies such as micelles within the film.                    
              Such structures will affect the stability and dynamics of                      
              these films and will control the wetting and spreading of bulk                 
              fluid bodies attached to them.  Although the subject of a                      
              number of earlier investigations, questions remain open                        
              concerning the arrangement of surfactant molecules in thin                     
              films on solid surfaces.  Direct measurement of this molecular                 
              ordering will clarify some of these outstanding issues,                        
              providing new understanding of the influence of interfaces on                  
              self-assembly and impacting on a number of technologies which                  
              involves interfacial properties and spreading of surfactant                    
              solutions.  X-ray and neutron reflectometry are rapidly                        
              evolving techniques which can probe the molecular arrangements                 
              in such films.  Using these techniques, the nature of the                      
              molecular monolayers on the bounding interfaces of thin films                  
              on solid surfaces and the ordering of the surfactant molecules                 
              within the films is explored.
