Abstract    :
              This project uses tools and methods of statistical mechanics to                
              introduce a unified computational approach to analyze the performance          
              of large-scale multiprocessor systems.  The aim is to derive a small           
              amount of "macroscopic" information about system (thermodynamic)               
              averages, despite the vast complexity of "microscopic" interactions            
              (a "microscopic" theory dealing with interactions of each processor            
              with other system components is likely to overwhelm the user with              
              detail and fail to adequately understand the system behavior - this is         
              analogous of studying the trajectory of each molecule of a gas when            
              we are interested in steady-state averages).  Therefore, it seems              
              natural that the complexity existing in multiprocessor systems is the          
              sort of complexity that ought to yield to some sort of treatment               
              analogous to statistical mechanics.                                            
                                                                                             
              The approach is to use a physical analogy between the execution of a           
              parallel algorithm on a multiprocessor system and a physical system to         
              obtain fast approximation methods for the performance analysis of              
              concurrency.  An approach to analyze critical phenomena ("hot spots")          
              in large multiprocessor systems is suggested by analogy to critical            
              phase transitions in physics.  The results will be compared with               
              extensive measurements and simulations on a multiprocessor to provide          
              empirical evidence for the viability of the approach.  Success in this         
              effort would mean the establishment of a general and unified approach          
              for a "macroscopic": description and analysis of multiprocessor                
              performance.
