Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The project examines the flow of simple, oligomeric and                        
              polymeric fluids inside perfectly straight and parallel,                       
              ultra-narrow pores.  Under these conditions, flow cannot be                    
              described in terms of macroscopic (continuum) hydrodynamics,                   
              and its features are quite sensitive to the molecular                          
              structure of the fluid and of the solid surface.  Molecular                    
              simulation is closely coordinated with state-of-the-art                        
              characterization of the micropores and pressure drop-flow rate                 
              measurements.  The microporous media consist of etched sheets                  
              of mica with diameters of 60  or more.  The shape of the                      
              micropores and the exposed atomic groups on the pore surfaces                  
              are determined by SEM and atomic force microscopy.  The                        
              research aims at clarifying the effects of confinenement-                      
              induced inhomogeneities on flow, the role of solid/fluid                       
              interactions on the dynamic fluid structure and mobility, and                  
              the importance of molecular architecture.  The research                        
              results impact on flow of oil in porous rocks, magnetic data-                  
              storage discs lubrication, membrane permeability and                           
              selectivity, and melt fracturing during capillary extrusion.
