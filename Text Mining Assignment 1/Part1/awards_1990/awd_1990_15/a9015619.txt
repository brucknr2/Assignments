Abstract    :
              The purpose of this SGER award is to initiate a collaborative                  
              investigation of B isotopic fractionation between well                         
              characterized samples of hydrothermal brines and associated vein               
              mineralization at the Salton Sea, Coso, and Geysers geothermal                 
              fields.  This study will serve to evaluate both B elemental and                
              isotopic partitioning between several common alteration minerals               
              and the fluids from which they precipitated.  Empirical                        
              calibration of temperature effects on such partitioning is also                
              possible using reservoir characteristics established for                       
              commercial geothermal wells in these fields.  Essentially, it is               
              planned to use the natural systems as a form of experimental                   
              calibration.  This approach will provide an important survey of B              
              concentrations in a variety of hydrothermal minerals(and of the                
              feasibility of B isotopic analysis in each) that will focus                    
              subsequent detailed experimentation on those mineral species                   
              having the greatest potential for practical applications.                      
              Isotopic measurements will be carried out at the National                      
              Institute for Standards and Technology in collaboration with                   
              R. Vocke whose research group has recently developed an improved               
              method for B isotopic mass spectrometry.  It is proposed to first              
              analyze selected fluid samples previously collected by      M.A.               
              McKibben to refine methods for isotopic analysis, then to visit                
              representative wells from each of the geothermal fields for                    
              further sampling of fluids and vein mineralization (from core and              
              cuttings).
