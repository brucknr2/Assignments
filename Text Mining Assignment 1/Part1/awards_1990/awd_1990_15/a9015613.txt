Abstract    :
              In this project, a newly established organization called Coastal               
              Ocean Processes (CoOP) will convene a workshop in July, 1990, to               
              focus the goals and directions for interdisciplinary coastal                   
              oceanographic research for the next 1-2 decades.  Results of the               
              meeting will be published during the fall of 1990, and will be                 
              used by NSF to develop future coastal research opportunities.
