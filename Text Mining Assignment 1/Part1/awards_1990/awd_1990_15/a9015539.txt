Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Serotonin, a compound found throughout the central nervous system              
              of mammals, is involved in the transmission of impulses between                
              nerve cells.  Though small in number, serotonergic nerve cells                 
              have been implicated in many important phenomena such as sleep,                
              control of food intake and pain.  The aim of this research is to               
              develop a method to isolate serotonergic nerve terminals,                      
              purifying the cells in an intact, functioning state.  This                     
              investigation entails of developing a complete set of specific                 
              fluorescent markers for serotonin neurons.  Dr. Wolf will utilize              
              high affinity serotonin analogues which will incorporate a                     
              sulfhydryl group to the primary amino group of serotonin.                      
              Fluorescein, a fluorescent marker, and other suitable markers,                 
              can be coupled through the sulfhydryl group to the analogues.                  
              The markers are absorbed by serotonergic neurons which become                  
              visible under a fluorescent microscope.  The results of this                   
              exploratory study will advance our understanding in the                        
              regulation and the biochemical basis of serotonergic                           
              neurotransmission.
