Abstract    :
              This Research Initiation Award will help Dr. Lee to extend the                 
              highly successful SPHINX speech recognition system to require                  
              less vocabulary-specific training for new tasks.  Proposed                     
              techniques include linguistic modeling of allophonic variations,               
              automatic subword clustering, and incremental vocabulary                       
              adaptation.  The research should provide insights into subword                 
              modeling and fusion of linguistic theory, statistical learning,                
              and incremental learning theory.
