Abstract    :
              Corporations are responsible for a significant fraction of hedging             
              volume on futures and options markets, but there is as yet no                  
              satisfactory rigorous theory that explains why financial hedging               
              by corporations takes place.  The contribution from this project               
              comes from developing a theory of corporate financial hedging based            
              on agency costs.  This theory will provide insights into the                   
              interrelations between information, managerial compensation                    
              schemes, the selection of investment projects, and corporate                   
              financial hedging.                                                             
                                                                                             
              The project also addresses the foundations of financial economic               
              theory.  Asset pricing theory depends on a restrictive model of                
              intertemporal preferences for the analysis of financial dynamics.              
              Specifically, individual intertemporal preferences are assumed to              
              be additively separable.  The investigator pioneered in his                    
              previous work the use of Stochastic Differential Utility (SDU) as              
              a model of preferences for consumption processes in a continuous-              
              time setting.  This project provides further elaboration of the SDU            
              preference model, the establishment of conditions for the existence            
              of market equilibrium in settings with heterogeneous agents, and               
              applications to asset pricing theory.
