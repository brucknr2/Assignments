Abstract    :
              This Research Opportunities for Women Career Advancement Award                 
              is in the general area of inorganic chemistry.  Dr. Linda D.                   
              Schultz of Tarleton State University will study the mechanisms                 
              of reaction for alkali metal polytellurides with transition                    
              metal carbonyl compounds using conventional thermal techniques                 
              and pulsed laser flash photolysis.  While Dr. Schultz has                      
              studied both metal carbonyls and polytellurides previously,                    
              this will be her first investigation using pulsed laser flash                  
              photolysis.  The instrumentation is located in Dr. Gerard R.                   
              Dobson's laboratories at the University of North Texas in                      
              Denton, Texas.  This award will assist her in establishing an                  
              expanded research program and if the project is successful may                 
              enable a proposal for sustained study.
