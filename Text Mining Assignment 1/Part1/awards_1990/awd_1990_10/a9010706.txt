Abstract    :
              A series of physical studies will be performed to examine how                  
              the carbohydrate side chains of a glycoprotein (and their                      
              chain length) affect the secondary and tertiary structure of                   
              the glycoprotein, the thermodynamics of unfolding and 3-                       
              dimensional structure.  To accomplish these goals:  (1) a                      
              series of derivatives of beta2 glycoproteinI  (B2GPI) will be                  
              prepared and isolated using specific enzymes to sequentially                   
              remove individual carbohydrate residues from each of the                       
              N-linked chains; (2) the solution conformation of each                         
              derivative (both secondary and tertiary structure) will be                     
              examined using far and near UV CD spectroscopy.  These                         
              studies will be performed as a function to temperature in                      
              aqueous buffers.  The solvent environment will also be varied                  
              to investigate the effect of different solvents (aqueous                       
              buffers, ionic strength, pH, organic solvents) have on the                     
              conformation of each derivative; (3) the thermodynamics of                     
              unfolding of each derivative will be examined using high                       
              resolution calorimetry.  This will provide energetic                           
              information on the effect of carbohydrate chain length on the                  
              thermal stability of each derivative.   Aqueous buffer, ionic                  
              strength and pH will be varied.  The thermodynamic data will                   
              be correlated with the structural data provided in goal (2);                   
              (4) native B2GPI, one partially deglycosylated and the totally                 
              deglycosylated derivatives will be crystallized.  The effect                   
              of carbohydrate chain alteration on the conditions for                         
              crystal growth and crystal structure which may arise from                      
              alteration of the conformation of the folded polypeptide as a                  
              result of removal of defined carbohydrate residues will be                     
              examined.
