Abstract    :
              This Research Opportunies for Women Career Advancement Award is                
              in the area of analytical and surface chemistry.  Dr. Janet G.                 
              Osteryoung of the Chemistry Department of the State University                 
              of New York at Buffalo will use pulse voltammetry to                           
              investigate corrosion of copper in hydrochloric acid solution.                 
              Study of this basic system will allow testing of the technique                 
              and comparison of findings to those of other methods, and lay                  
              the foundation for extended study of ferrous steels.  The award                
              will also permit Dr. Osteryoung to visit a number of                           
              laboratories which have significant programs in corrosion                      
              studies, thus becoming more familiar with the field and                        
              obtaining critiques of her plans.  This award will open a new                  
              area of investigation to Dr. Osteryoung, whose previous work                   
              has been in solving analytical chemistry problems using                        
              electroanalytical chemistry techniques.
