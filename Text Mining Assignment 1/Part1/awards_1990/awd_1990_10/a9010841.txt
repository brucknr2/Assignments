Abstract    :
              This study will evaluate the feasibility of a plant cell                       
              culture process to produce a protein product.  The system                      
              which will be studied is the production of a protein,                          
              trichosanthin, from plant cell cultures of Trichosanthes                       
              cucumerina and Trichosanthes kirilowii.  Trichosanthin is                      
              a fairly well characterized protein that has been                              
              reported in the literature and may have significant value                      
              as a human therapeutic agent.  In addition to improving                        
              the understanding of the important engineering aspects of                      
              plant cell cultures, the development of plant cell                             
              culture process technology for trichosanthin may lead the                      
              way for development of processes for production of other                       
              ribosome inactivating proteins.
