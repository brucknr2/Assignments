Abstract    :
              Three types of subcube management strategies are being investigated.           
              The program can be divided into two parts.  The first part is                  
              concerned with design and analysis of algorithms that are necessary            
              for efficiently implementing such strategies.  Problems to be solved           
              in this part of research are mostly combinatorial optimization                 
              problems, and the approaches will be algorithmic and analytic.  The            
              second part of this project is concerned with performance evaluations          
              and comparisons of different subcube management strategies.  The               
              study will be based on probabilistic models, and both analytic and             
              simulation techniques will be employed.
