Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Fuel spray vaporization is a crucial phase in the operation of                 
                                                                                             
              liquid fuel combustion devices.  At present there is a lack of                 
                                                                                             
              studies of evaporating sprays with quantitative measurements                   
              of the vapor phase distribution, a result of the limitations                   
              of the measurement techniques available for measuring vapor.                   
                                                                                             
              A nonintrusive, laser based, infrared extinction technique has                 
                                                                                             
              been developed based on the strong absorption of incident                      
              radiation at a 3.39 wavelength by hydrocarbon fuels.  The                      
              technique holds great promise for accurate quantitative                        
              measurement of the vapor phase but, due to its limited use,                    
              little knowledge is available on the accuracy of the technique                 
                                                                                             
              in two-phase flows.  In order to fully assess the accuracy and                 
                                                                                             
              limitations of the infrared extinction technique in                            
              quantifying fuel vaporization, an experiment is proposed in                    
              which the techniques will be used in a very controlled                         
              simulated spray                                                                
              environment.  The simulated spray consists of solid                            
              polystyrene spheres injected with a pure hydrocarbon gas,                      
              providing great flexibility in studying the effects of spray                   
              characteristics on the accuracy of the vapor measurements.                     
                                                                                             
              Finally, improvements are proposed in the optical system                       
              geometry previously used for the infrared extinction                           
              technique, allowing more spatially precise measurements.                       
              Spatial precision is vital to the successful application of                    
              the infrared extinction technique to pulsed sprays and highly                  
              turbulent flows.
