Abstract    :
              This project explores methods for improving the performance of                 
              parallel discrete-event simulation by combining features of both               
              conservative and optimistic synchronization strategies.  Rather than           
              attempting to avoid rollback, which is accomplished by slowing down            
              the fastest components of the simulation, the strategy is to avoid             
              state checkpointing, which should speed up the slowest components.             
                                                                                             
              The project is experimental in nature.  A single implementation will           
              allow one to make fair comparisons between the performance of pure             
              conservative synchronization, and a hybrid method.  Furthermore, by            
              adding a mechanism for limiting the degree of optimism in both the             
              pure optimistic and the hybrid cases, it will be possible to verify or         
              refute the hypothesis that the overhead of optimistic rollback is a            
              second-order effect compared to the overhead of state checkpointing.           
              Subject to the successful verification of this hypothesis, this                
              research will continue with heuristics for dynamically adapting the            
              degree of optimism in a simulation during its execution.
