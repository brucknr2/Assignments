Abstract    :
              Increasingly, society is demanding that people put their knowledge to          
              use. One such application is the design of artifacts.  The importance of       
              technological support in the design process is clearly recognized by           
              professional designers.  The aim of this project is to explore                 
              how high schools and college students can best be supported as they            
              learn a  particular type of design process--software design.  To this          
              end, an educationally-motivated and educationally-sound computer-aided         
              design environment (SODA, Software Design Lab) will be developed and           
              classroom tested; SODA goes beyond merely supporting slices of the             
              design process, and provides support for the four major activities in          
              software design:  planning, generating and evaluating alternative              
              designs, debugging, and reflecting.  Key to effective design is the            
              management of complexity.  Thus, in SODA, there will be mechanisms to          
              manage artifact complexity (e.g., plan  libraries), process complexity         
              (e.g. aids to create and then navigate among  alternative designs), as         
              well as mechanisms to facilitate learning (e.g.,                               
              scaffolding and customization).                                                
                                                                                             
              The research plan is to test increasingly more sophisticated versions of       
              SODA, in four different educational environments using a broad range of        
              students.  A systematic procedure has been designed to assess student          
              performance as well as process, using quantitative and qualitative             
              methods; transfer of design skills will also be examined.
