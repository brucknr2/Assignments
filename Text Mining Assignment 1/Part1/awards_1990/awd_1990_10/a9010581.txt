Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal requests funds to be used to obtain a Fourier                    
              transform infra-red (FTIR) spectrometer that would serve                       
              the needs of Professor Curtis Frank, Gerald Fuller and                         
              Alice Gast in research investigating the properties and                        
              processing requirements of polymer thin films.  The                            
              instrument that has been selected is the Nicolet Series 800                    
              FTIR Spectometer.  It is equipped with a Model 600 Data                        
              Processing Unit that includes a 100 megabyte hard disk with                    
              direct memory access.  Two liquid nitrogen cooled detectors                    
              provide high speed data acquisition and a wavenumber range                     
              of 30,000-10/cm.  The resolution of the instrument is                          
              0.09/cm.  Scanning rates up to 50/sec are possible.
