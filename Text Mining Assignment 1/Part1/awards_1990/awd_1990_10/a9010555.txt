Abstract    :
              The main objective of this work is to investigate connectionist                
              (neural network) clustering models.  Several areas of focus are:               
              1. a new mode-seeking clustering algorithm that handles nominal                
              attributes and small sample size;  its realization as a parallel               
              and distributed process; 2. limited lateral inhibition,                        
              particularly its effects on topographic maps; 3. artificial                    
              neurons as evidence combination units and their realization of                 
              probabilistic reasoning; 4. incremental versions of mode-seeking               
              clustering algorithsm.  The results of this work can be used in                
              the design of new content-addressable memories, indexing methods               
              in case-based reasoning, and other efforts in the understanding                
              of intelligent systems.
