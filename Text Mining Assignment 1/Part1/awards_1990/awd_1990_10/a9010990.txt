Abstract    :
                   This grant is for an international conference on asymptotic               
              expansion and perturbation theory to be held in January 1991 at                
              San Diego, CA.  The title of the conference, Asymptotics Beyond                
              All Orders, refers to a small but significant class of problems                
              in which conventional asymptotic methods provide no information                
              at any order of the expansion.  Problems of this nature are                    
              unusual, but not impossible:  examples are known in                            
              hydrodynamics, plasma physics, crystal growth, and quantum                     
              mechanics.  Several of these problems in widely different fields               
              have been solved recently, using several apparently different                  
              methods.  What the different methods of solution have in common                
              is still largely unexplored.                                                   
                   The purpose of this conference is to convene the principal                
              participants in this nascent field for an in-depth comparison of               
              their problems and their methods of solution.
