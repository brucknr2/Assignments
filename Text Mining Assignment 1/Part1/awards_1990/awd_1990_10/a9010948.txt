Abstract    :
              This research is on developing a probabilistic diagnosis model for             
              adaptive system level diagnosis.  In this model the faulty probability         
              of a unit (calculated by a Bayesian approach) is used to determine             
              whether a diagnosis is successful.  This limits tests to only those that       
              contribute to the detection of faulty units.  Research tasks are: (1)          
              deriving an optimal algorithm for selecting the next test in the               
              adaptive diagnosis based on current post-diagnosis fault probabilities;        
              (2) determining a fixed sequence of tests which minimizes the average          
              number of possible fault patterns; (3) find the minimal subset of tests        
              that lead to a successful diagnosis, assuming all tests pass without           
              detection; and (4) explore the relationship between the diagnosis time         
              and the coverage.
