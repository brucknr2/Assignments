Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a post-event investigation project to learn                            
              engineering lessons from the Loma Prieta earthquake (October                   
              1989).                                                                         
                                                                                             
              The objective of this project is to establish more rational                    
              guidelines for the detail and proportion of shear wall                         
              buildings for earthquake resistance.  The research conducted                   
              involves detailed analytical studies on two shear wall                         
              dominant buildings in the San Francisco Bay area.  The                         
              buildings were subjected to the 17 October 1989 Loma Prieta                    
              Earthquake, and suffered no apparent damage.  The buildings                    
              had been instrumented by the California Strong Motion                          
              Instrumentation Program (CSMIP), and substantial data was                      
              recorded in the event and its aftershocks.  In addition,                       
              building responses have been measured in the previous                          
              earthquakes of lesser intensity; therefore, a broad range of                   
              data exists to study building performances.  The analytical                    
              studies are designed to evaluate current modeling techniques                   
              and code requirements for shear wall buildings in regions of                   
              moderate to severe seismicity.                                                 
                                                                                             
              Findings and conclusions of the investigation will be used to                  
              evaluate possible modifications to existing codes.
