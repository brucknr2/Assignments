Abstract    :
              This is an application to study spectroscopically the                          
              mineral coating of composite prosthetic implants.  The                         
              hypothesis is that the nature of the bone-implant                              
              interface is determined by the nature of the implant                           
              surface whether or not the interface is occupied by                            
              mineralized or non-mineralized tissue.   The hypothesis                        
              will be tested using animal experiments.  The primary                          
              tool for surface characterization is Raman spectroscopy;                       
              spectral resolution will be enhanced by 2nd derivative                         
              computations.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              This study will provide basic information about the                            
              interface between bone and various calcium mineral                             
              coatings.  The gained knowledge should be very useful for                      
              designing optimized mineral coatings for implants.
