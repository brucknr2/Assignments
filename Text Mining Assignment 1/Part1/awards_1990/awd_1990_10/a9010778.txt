Abstract    :
                   Parallel processing systems will be studied from a queueing               
              theoretic point of view, under general assumptions of stationarity             
              and ergodicity of the random input flow of jobs.  The jobs have                
              some complex internal structure, consisting of multiple elementary             
              tasks, that have to be executed by a system of processors,                     
              according to some specifications.  The classical queueing theoretic            
              problems of stability, asymptotic stationarity etc. will be                    
              addressed, as well as control theoretic problems of optimal dynamic            
              scheduling of jobs to processors in order to optimize the                      
              performance of the system, for example, maximize the throughput.               
              Analysis will focus on basic prototypical models of parallel                   
              processing, capturing the essential operational characteristics of             
              large classes of parallel processing systems.                                  
                   The research is important for understanding the operation of              
              parallel processing systems at a fundamental mathematical level and            
              establishing techniques to optimize their performance, based on a              
              solid mathematical methodology, contrary to the largely heuristic              
              current practice.
