Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The P.I.s propose the acquisition of a scanning electron                       
              microscope with an EDS x-ray detection system, stage and                       
              electron optical column automation, image acquisition,                         
              processing and electron beam lithography software.                             
              Specifically, a JEOL JSM 6400 SEM and Link Analytical eXL                      
              analyzer and LZ4 Si(Li) detector, stage and beam automation                    
              hardware and software are requested.  The microscope will                      
              be used by a number of engineering research programs in                        
              materials science, microelectronics and tribology.                             
              Additional uses will be in biomedical engineering and                          
              related fields.  The microscope will be housed in and                          
              operated by the Rippel Electron Microscope Facility at                         
              Dartmouth College.  Facility personnel will train others in                    
              the use and care of the microscope and will oversee                            
              appropriate use of the microscope.
