Abstract    :
              A core of instrumentation will be established to facilitate and                
              promote a variety and ongoing series of projects in molecular                  
              biology and molecular genetics.  The following new equipment                   
              items requested are:  a DNA sequencer, and an expanded                         
              centralized computer system for DNA/protein sequence analysis.                 
              The facility will also include a DNA synthesizer, a fluorimeter,               
              an HPLC, and a high voltage paper electrophoresis apparatus.  The              
              facility would be supervised and maintained by a dedicated                     
              technician, who would also carry out the DNA syntheses and the                 
              DNA sequencing gel runs.  Major users of this facility are                     
              studying the expression of the dihydrofolate reductase gene in                 
              cultured mammalian cells, the role of the enhancer in                          
              immunoglobulin gene regulation, the mechanism of RNA splicing and              
              3' end formation, biogenesis of mitochondria in yeast,                         
              transcription termination and antitermination in E. coli, and the              
              characterization of genes controlling cell differentiation in C.               
              elegans.  The facility would be available to all 24 laboratories               
              of the Columbia Department of Biological Sciences, and to a                    
              limited extent, to undergraduates.
