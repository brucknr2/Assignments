Abstract    :
              Strategies for exploiting the resources of a privately owned                   
              workstation cluster while insuring little or no interference to the            
              owners of workstations are being developed.  By building a simulation          
              environment that takes advantage of the usage characteristics of               
              workstation owners, improvements of the quality of service is enjoyed          
              by all users.  The system will enable users to submit project                  
              descriptions of simulation models to the system from which they will           
              receive graphical displays of the results.  The project descriptions           
              include a specification of the simulation jobs to be executed, the             
              time constraints of the project, and characteristics of the jobs.  An          
              important feature to be developed and evaluated is the system's                
              deadline-driven scheduling facility.  Simulation jobs will be                  
              scheduled to meet the deadlines of the time constraints imposed on the         
              jobs.  In addition, the scheduler will allow users to be allocated             
              partitions of idle workstations for developing distributed                     
              applications.  In order to provide scheduling strategies for meeting           
              deadlines and allocating partitions of idle workstations, workload             
              models of the usage characteristics of workstations are being                  
              developed.
