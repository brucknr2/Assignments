Abstract    :
              Selective visual attention serializes the processing of stimulus               
              data to make efficient use of limited processing resources in the              
              human visual system.  This work will develop a connectionist                   
              network to emulate a variety of attentional phenomena that have                
              been reported by Treisman, Wolford, Duncan and others.  As                     
              demonstrated in preliminary work, a hierarchical, multi-scale                  
              network that uses feature arrays with strong lateral inhibitory                
              connections is capable of producing responses that are suggestive              
              of a number of key behaviors associated with visual attention.                 
              The work to be done involves integrating the network structures                
              of the earlier work into a single cohesive architecture,                       
              elaborating this network model to support additional function,                 
              and tuning the network structure to provide a more quantitative                
              match with behavioral and neural data.  The goals of the work are              
              to provide (1) a practical computational model for machine                     
              recognition systems, (2) a model of human visual attention that                
              is more comprehensive than current theories, and (3) a network                 
              model that makes contact with data on the neural basis of                      
              attention.
