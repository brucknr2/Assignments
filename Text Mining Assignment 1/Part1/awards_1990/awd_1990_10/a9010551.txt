Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is a demographic study of factors causing a rise in               
              fertility in Malaysia.  The area has experienced economic devel-               
              opment for several decades, and usually that fact would lead to                
              declining birth rates.  However, since about 1970, fertility has               
              increased.  PI plans to focus on two potential explanations,                   
              ethnic pride (and competition), and pro-natalist aspects of                    
              government policy.  Results of the research will advance demogra-              
              phic understanding of determinants of fertility, and will have                 
              implications for population control programs.  The project is                  
              partially supported by RAND Corporation, The Population Council,               
              and the Population Reference Bureau in addition to NSF.
