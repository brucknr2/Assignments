Abstract    :
                   The PI has discovered a unique protein that appears to be                 
              essential to the biologic clock which determines daily rythms                  
              controlled by the brain.  The discovery of the protein came out                
              of work she did at Harvard on the molecular biology of the                     
              "period" gene in the Drosophila and its influence on biological                
              rhythms.  From this lowly fly brain an exciting generalization                 
              has come because the proteins which the Drosophila genes express               
              in neurons are also expressed in the hypothalamus of vertebrate                
              animals.  This indicates the vital importance of the gene to                   
              brain function as it has been conserved for millions of years.                 
              Dr. Siwicki will study the neurons in the brain by applying an                 
              antibody she has produced to the protein produced by the gene and              
              study the electrophysiology of the identified neurons to test the              
              biological consequence of neurons containing the protein.  This                
              should clarify if cells that produce the product are rythm                     
              generators which keep the brain "on time" to coordinate brain                  
              function.
