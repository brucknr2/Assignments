Abstract    :
              The demand for high-speed computation in many digital signal processing        
              (DSP) and scientific application and the availability of low cost, high        
              speed, high density VLSI technology have provided a new dimension in           
              implementing architectures, particularly the evolvement of algorithm-          
              based application-specific architectures.  Systolic array is one class         
              of such architectures that exploits the strength of VLSI and is                
              particularly suitable for implementing many DSP algorithms which are           
              well-structured and locally recursive.  As demand in speed and                 
              application rises, many systolic arrays have become more complex in            
              terms of cell structure, interconnection topology, and data flow.              
              Complete, precise, and formal description of architectures has become          
              vital for unambiguous and complete communication among designers and           
              implementers, as well as for formal verification of design correctness.        
              The main objective of the research is to fully develop a solid formalism       
              and apply it to systolic array level specification and design                  
              verification: (1) The formalism must provide simple, and yet complete          
              and precise description (specification) of any systolic structure and          
              behavior; (2) the formalism and related techniques developed must              
              exploit unique attributes of systolic arrays ( synchrony, modularity,          
              regularity, spatial and temporal locality, pipelinability,                     
              repeatability, and parallel processing ability) to produce notations and       
              verification procedures that are simple, elegant, and efficient; (3) the       
              constructs and operators involved should preferably be able to be              
              unified with one useful lower level formalism for coherent multilevel          
              reasoning; (4) the techniques should be automated and developed into a         
              CAD tool eventually; (5) the formalism must be further expanded for            
              synthesis description and design debugging.  The proposed research will        
              be carried out through rigorous and comprehensive survey, theoretical          
              analysis, design, and implementation.
