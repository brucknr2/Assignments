Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Attitudes are thought to serve many functions.  They influence                 
              perception and information processing.  This proposal seeks to                 
              identify a function that to this point has only ben suggested,                 
              namely, the facilitative effects of attitudes on decision making               
              in stressful contexts.  We know from prior psychophysiological                 
              work that tasks involving active coping with threat or                         
              challenging evoke greater increments in heart rate, cardiac                    
              output, systolic blood pressure, and myocardial contractility.                 
              The issue of this research is whether an individual coping with a              
              threat in a situation involving well-established attitudes will                
              show less reactivity than an individual in a novel (attitudinal)               
              setting.  The strength of the proposal is that it melds                        
              psychophysiological measurement with expertise in attitudinal                  
              measurement and induction to provide an answer to this important               
              question.  The combination of these two approaches is novel and                
              important, and promises much information on the interaction of                 
              social cognition (attitudes) and physiology.  This research could              
              add appreciably to out understanding of the effects of stress on               
              human functioning and performance.
