Abstract    :
                   Statistical research will be conducted on finding outliers                
              in data that is based on "elemental sets". This involves fitting               
              many models to the data, each an exact fit to a minimally-sized                
              subset of the original data, and combining the information from                
              these elemental sets in suitable ways to identify multiple                     
              outliers reliably and in a single pass. The connection between                 
              this method and more traditional methods as well as high                       
              breakdown points and acceptable efficiency will be investigated                
              for multivariate data in the multivariate regression model and in              
              other types of structured data. The computational implications                 
              and the algebraic connections between elemental sets in                        
              regression and the simplex algorithm of linear programming will                
              be explored.
