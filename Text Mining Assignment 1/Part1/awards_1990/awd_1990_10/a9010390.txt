Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to develop an approach to                     
              better design of systems for decontamination of                                
              groundwater than is now generally in use for remediation                       
              of aquifers contaminated by seepage from hazardous wastes                      
              sites.  The procedure being developed in this project is                       
              directed toward optimizing the number and location of                          
              wells and for determination of the pumping rates to be                         
              used during the remediation process.  It will also include                     
              an algorithm for including installation and construction                       
              costs in the economic description of the proposed system.                      
                                                                                             
              The proposal leading to this award was submitted in accord                     
              with the NSF Program Announcement:  Research Initiation                        
              Awards, NSF 88-99.  Results are expected to provide an                         
              approach that can be used to improve the engineering                           
              design of systems for decontamination of groundwater                           
              aquifers.  It is expected to have an advantage over                            
              procedures now being used for determination of the number,                     
              location and pumping rates of remediation wells.  Results                      
              of this research may also be applied to engineering design                     
              of systems to protect aquifers from potential                                  
              contamination by seepage from hazardous waste disposal                         
              sites.
