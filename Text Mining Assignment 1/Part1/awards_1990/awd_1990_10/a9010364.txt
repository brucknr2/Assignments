Abstract    :
              Andreou         Analog VLSI is a promising approach to the design of systems 
              for machine vision since it leads to distributed, data driven  architectures,
              that map the light stimuli directly to the crux of  computing hardware, the
              silicon substrate.  This emerging class  of signal processing systems is based
              on relatively simple  computational primitives such as logarithmic
              photodetectors,  aggregating resistive networks and coupled non-linear
              resistive  networks.  Furthermore, there are power and area efficient  features
              that make them attractive for wafer scale integration.   However, manufacturing
              of such systems at the wafer scale will  strongly depend on establishing design
              methodologies that make  them robust to defects in the fabrication process. 
              Equally  important, these must be augmented with yield estimation models  as
              well as testing and failure analysis procedures.  The above  issues are
              addressed in this research in a comprehensive program  that involves both
              analytical calculations and experimental  studies.
