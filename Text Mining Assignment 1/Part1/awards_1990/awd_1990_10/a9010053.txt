Abstract    :
              The role of melamine-formaldehyde as a bonding agent of paper                  
              fibers will be studied in detail.  The results will be used                    
              to formulate property requirements for alternate bonding                       
              agents.  The location of the binder within the fibers and                      
              within the composite will be determined and correlated with                    
              the nature of the chemical bonds between fiber and binder and                  
              with the mechanical properties of the paper.
