Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to undertake a fundamental                    
              and quantitative study of the manipulation of cell                             
              metabolism for the enhanced synthesis of foreign proteins.                     
              The proposed research program will use a combination of                        
              experimental and theoretical methods to examine the                            
              influence that induced protein expression has on amino acid                    
              regulation and cell growth.  This study will use an                            
              expression vector for the induced synthesis of a                               
              homopolypeptide, facilitating a detailed examination of                        
              intracellular amino acid depletion.  In addition, this                         
              research will examine metabolic and product expression                         
              characteristics dynamically, using a specially designed                        
              on-line cell mass measurement device in concert with a                         
              dynamic metabolic model.
