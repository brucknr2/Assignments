Abstract    :
              If solar energy is to make a significant contribution to the                   
              national energy economy, it must displace the use of fossil                    
              fuels to supply process heat to the industrial sector.                         
              Industry generally uses high temperature steam in the range                    
              200-700 oC1.  Temperatures in this range can be attained with                  
              ease in a concentrating solar facility.  But most industrial                   
              users of process heat are not located in a climate of reliable                 
              solar flux.  It is a major challenge to efficiently store and                  
              deliver the high temperature thermal energy from the solar                     
              concentrator to the point of use.  If the high temperature                     
              energy available in the solar concentrator were used as the                    
              process heat for an endothermic reaction between gases, then                   
              the solar energy would be stored in the products of the                        
              reaction.  The gaseous products then could be transported at                   
              ambient temperatures in a conventional pipeline hundreds of                    
              kilometers to the industrial user, where energy could be                       
              recovered in the reverse, exothermic reaction.  Such a system                  
              is known as a thermochemical pipe, or chemical heat pipe.                      
                                                                                             
              This research planning grant will examine the technical and                    
              economic feasibility of a chemical heat pipe system.  The                      
              design of a reactor-receiver system that decouples the                         
              absorption of the solar energy from the chemical reaction of                   
              interest will be considered.
