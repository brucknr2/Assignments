Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to investigate grammar-based data             
              specifications for testing, analysis, and verification of sequential           
              and concurrent software.  Specific research topics include:                    
                                                                                             
              (1)  To address issues, such as the problem of expressing contextual           
              dependencies, in the use of grammer-based data specification for test          
              generation.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              (2)  To explore uses, such as demonstrating consistency between                
              communicating processes, of grammar-based data specifications for              
              analysis and verification.                                                     
                                                                                             
              (3)  To investigate techniques, such as generating self-checking test          
              cases, of exploiting grammar-based data specifications for test result         
              evaluation.
