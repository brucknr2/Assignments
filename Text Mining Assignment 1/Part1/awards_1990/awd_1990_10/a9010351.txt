Abstract    :
              The objective of this work is to develop adaptive software cache               
              management techniques that will allow programs written for shared              
              memory multiprocessors to be executed efficiently on distributed               
              memory machines.  These techniques will facilitate a system that               
              overcomes the architectural limitations of shared memory machines,             
              while maintaining their advantages in terms of ease of programming.            
              Translation from the shared memory programming model to the                    
              distributed memory hardware is done by runtime software, with the aid          
              of hints provided by the user or by the compiler.  The runtime system          
              implements an adaptive cache coherence mechanism that exploits                 
              semantic information about the expected or observed access behavior of         
              particular data objects.  Preliminary measurements on a adaptive               
              caching outperforms static cache coherence mechanisms, while                   
              extracting only limited cost when coherence is implemented in                  
              software.  These experiments will be extended to include a broad range         
              of programs.
