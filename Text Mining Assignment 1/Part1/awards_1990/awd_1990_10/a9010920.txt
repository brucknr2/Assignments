Abstract    :
              This research will apply case-based reasoning techniques to the                
              construction of intelligent tutoring systems for diagnostic                    
              problem solving.  It is believed that when a tutoring system's                 
              expertise and curriculum are anchored in the same set of cases,                
              the tutor will be better able to select appropriate training                   
              cases, to assess student performance on these cases, and to                    
              remediate when errors are detected.  This work will build on the               
              foundation of the Protos automated knowledge acquisition system.               
              Complete tutoring systems will be developed in at least two                    
              domains.  Evaluation studies will compare the tutor's                          
              effectiveness to that of classroom instruction.  Evaluation in                 
              multiple domains will permit cross-domain comparison to separate               
              general results from domain idiosyncrasies.  The project will                  
              contribute to three areas of intelligent tutoring research.                    
              First, it will address the modeling of expert and student                      
              knowledge in "weak-theory" domains.  Second, it will address the               
              diagnosis and remediation of student errors.  Third, it will                   
              address curriculum generation and sequencing.  In the long term,               
              synthesis of the lessons learned from research in intelligent                  
              tutoring systems, expert consultation systems, and automated                   
              knowledge acquisition will contribute to a deeper understanding                
              of diagnostic expertise.
