Abstract    :
              Several new formulations are proposed to overcome the multi-                   
              frequency and non-uniqueness problems of the boundary element                  
              method in elastodynamics.  For the multi-frequency problem, two                
              improved boundary element techniques are proposed to make the                  
              analysis for an entire frequency spectrum possible and practical.              
              The first technique is to interpolate the "neutralized" boundary               
              element coefficient matrices in the frequency domain; the second               
              technique is to interpolate the Green function in the spatial                  
              domain.  Both techniques are suitable for vectorization and                    
              parallelization on supercomputers.  For the non-uniqueness problem,            
              two "enhanced CHIEF" methods are proposed to ensure the uniqueness             
              and accuracy of the boundary element solution for an exterior wave             
              propagation problem.  Vectorized and parallelized codes based on               
              the proposed formulations will also be made.  Application areas                
              include structural vibration, elastic wave propagation and earth-              
              structure interaction.
