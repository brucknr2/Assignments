Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The development of Shape Memory Effect (SME) thin films as                     
              intelligent materials for micro-switches and micro-mation                      
              actuators is proposed.  SME materials as "intelligent"                         
              actuator materials are attractive compared to electrostatic                    
              actuators requiring external control.  Stoichimetric NiTi                      
              is the most promising SME thin film candidate as it is a                       
              tough material with a convenient termperature                                  
              transformation range of 30--60 C, and also exhibits a                          
              strong recovery force on deformation.  As dopants, such as                     
              Ca, radically alter the transformation temperatures, NiTi                      
              will find applications in both micro-sensor fabricated by                      
              the author using RF sputter co-deposition onto Si and Al2O3                    
              substrates followed by thermal snnealing.  The optimal                         
              conditions and analysis by TEM and XRD.  Prototypical                          
              micro-switches and actuators using these films will be                         
              fabricated using conventioal lithographic techniques.
