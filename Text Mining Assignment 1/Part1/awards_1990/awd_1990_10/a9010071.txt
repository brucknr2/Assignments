Abstract    :
              This Research Opportunities for Women Research Planning Grant                  
              is in the general area of inorganic chemistry.  Dr. Sharon M.                  
              Palmer of the Chemistry Department of Smith College will                       
              explore the use of metalloporphyrins as dye sensitizers on                     
              metal oxide semiconductor electrodes in photoelectrochemical                   
              cells.  Metalloporphyrins have the long-lived excited states                   
              and high absorption coefficients in the visible region                         
              necessary to harvest solar energy.  Various metalloporphyrins                  
              will be tested for photoefficiency and a stable chemical means                 
              of attaching the porphyrins to the metal oxide electrode will                  
              be investigated.  Two undergraduate students will be involved                  
              in the project which, if promising, will lead to a proposal for                
              sustained study.
