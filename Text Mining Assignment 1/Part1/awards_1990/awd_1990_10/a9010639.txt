Abstract    :
              The Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County is committed to               
              establishing a multi-user facility for biochemical and molecular               
              systematic research.  the Museum has (1)  approved construction                
              of a new laboratory that will provide over 1,730 square feet of                
              space, (2) has agreed to provide salary for a full time manager                
              for the laboratory, (3) is identifying funds to purchase 30% of                
              the equipment to be used in the laboratory, and (4) has                        
              identified over $1,000,000 of endowment monies for long-term                   
              maintenance of the laboratory.  This proposal requests funds to                
              purchase major pieces of equipment to be shared by all major                   
              users of the facility.  The  requested equipment will be used in               
              a variety of research projects by staff members of the Museum, by              
              graduate students and postdoctoral fellows under the direction of              
              Museum staff members, and by other members of the academic                     
              community under direction of a Museum committee.
