Abstract    :
              The objective of the project is to design a computer system aimed              
              at improving the writing skills of the hearing impaired whose                  
              writing ability lags behind that of their hearing counterparts.                
              The benefit of such a system hinges on the system's ability to                 
              detect errors and to offer beneficial corrective advice.  The                  
              work will draw on work in second language acquistion and a                     
              linguistic comparison of American Sign Language and English as                 
              well as analysis of writing samples from hearing impaired                      
              individuals, in order to develop a taxonomy of expected errors.                
              The expected errors will be added as annotated "mal-rules" to a                
              grammar of English.  Upon parsing a sentence containing one of                 
              the identified errors, the system will use the annotations to                  
              generate a corrective response.  The user may then be queried in               
              order to acquire information necessary to correct the user's                   
              input sentence.  Finally, a correct sentence will be generated.                
              In addition to the potential benefit to the hearing impaired                   
              population, this work will lead toward a truly intelligent                     
              computer aided instruction system which will require advances in               
              current natural language processing capabilities.  In particualr,              
              advances will be made in dealing will ill-formed input as well as              
              in identifying sufficient representations for sencence                         
              generation.
