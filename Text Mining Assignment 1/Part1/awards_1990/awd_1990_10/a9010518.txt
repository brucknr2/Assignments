Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The eventual goal of this project is to                                        
              describe the flow of gases through the lung.                                   
              The specific objective of the proposed                                         
              research is to characterize experimentally                                     
              the axial and secondary flows in a model of                                    
              bifurcating tubes that is dynamically similar                                  
              to the human airways.  The flows will be                                       
              determined using laser-Doppler velocimetry at                                  
              frequencies of normal breathing and also at                                    
              frequencies used for high-frequency                                            
              ventilation.  This basic engineering research                                  
              is an important first step toward a                                            
              comprehensive description of flows in the                                      
              entire lung.  Such a description will lead to                                  
              improved basic understanding, and eventually                                   
              should also result in improved diagnostic and                                  
              therapeutic procedures.
