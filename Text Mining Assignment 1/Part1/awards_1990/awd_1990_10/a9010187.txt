Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Dystonia, the lack of muscle control with loss of muscle strength              
              indicates a neural deficit. The question is where in the brain is              
              the deficit? A useful model for studying dystonia is a genetic                 
              mutant rat ,the dt rat. The disorder in this mutant does not                   
              appear until the second week after birth and its neuronal                      
              morphology appears to be normal. To get a handle on the deficit                
              the investigator has used harmaline a drug known to cause tremor               
              inthe second week after birth and to act specifically on a neural              
              circuit in the brainstem, the IO-Cerebellar circuit. Dt rats do                
              not respond to haramline even during the first weeks of life.                  
              This to be used as a clue for investigating the physiological                  
              deficit in the dt rat. Harmaline will be administered in infant                
              rats and the whole circuit tested to see if one or all synaptic                
              linkages in the IO pathway are the source of the dystonia. The                 
              novel idea of using harmaline which has been well                              
              characterized,provides a pharmacological instrument for analysing              
              a specific neural system involved in motor movement.
