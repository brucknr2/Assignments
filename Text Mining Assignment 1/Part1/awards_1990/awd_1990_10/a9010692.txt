Abstract    :
              This Research Initiation Award is for investigation of object                  
              recognition by means of motion patterns.  Objects that typically               
              move are easier to identify when in motion.  Dr. Nelson will                   
              study both complex, non-rigid motion fields such as windblown                  
              trees, ripples on water, and chaotic fluid flow, and action                    
              identification for compact objects such as machinery and moving                
              people.  His recognition approach will apply methods of                        
              statistical texture identification to features extracted from                  
              optical motion fields.  Monitoring and surveillance are among the              
              possible applications.
