Abstract    :
              This grant is in the general area of analytical and surface                    
              chemistry and in the subfield of analytical spectroscopy.                      
              Professor Harris will study changes in molecular structure                     
              during laser-initiated chemical reactions using time-resolved                  
              laser spectroscopic methods.                                                   
                                                                                             
              This research will examine the reaction mechanisms involved in                 
              condensed phase laser-initiated reactions involving atoms,                     
              free-radicals and polymers.  Time-resolved photothermal                        
              spectroscopy and resonance Raman spectroscopy will be used to                  
              characterize the reactions over time scales ranging from                       
              fractions of nanoseconds to seconds.  The impact of this work                  
              will involve improving the understanding of condensed phase                    
              reactions that give rise to interesting products such as                       
              polymers.
