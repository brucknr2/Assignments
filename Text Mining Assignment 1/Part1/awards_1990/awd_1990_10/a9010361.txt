Abstract    :
              Noiseless (or reversible) methods are preferred over noisy (or                 
              irreversible) methods for the compression of grayscale images in               
              situations where the quality of the images is critical and/or where            
              postprocessing of the images is involved.  Two significant application         
              areas for such methods are in the storage and transmission of medical          
              images and industrial radiographic images used for nondestructive              
              evaluation (NDE).                                                              
                                                                                             
              The main objective of the proposed research is to improve existing and         
              develop new methods for the noiseless compression of grayscale images.         
              Sophisticated source modeling techniques and the powerful arithmetic           
              coding technique are used for this purpose.  It is expected that some          
              of the new methods to be developed will perform 30% to 40% better than         
              the existing methods.                                                          
                                                                                             
              Extensive statistical analyses of images and digital computer simulation       
              experiments will be the primary tools in implementing the project.  In         
              addition to providing new, improved methods for the compression of             
              grayscale images, the research project will also help shed some light          
              on certain important aspects of the noiseless data compression area as         
              a whole.
