Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A research program for the growth, characterization and                        
              testing of copper films for applications in the new                            
              generations of electronic devices is proposed.  The                            
              approach focuses on a CVD process which employs vapor                          
              precursors which dissociate at temperatures as low as                          
              150'C.  The process is "Low Temperature Metal-Organic CVD,"                    
              or LTMOCVD.
