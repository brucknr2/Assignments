Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research addresses the need for a more flexible,                          
              versatile and multifingered robotic hand to augment the                        
              dexterity of a robotic arm.  Its objective is to complete a                    
              unified approach to the analysis of dexterous manipulation,                    
              and the design of robotic hands based on this functionality.                   
              The research is implemented by applying techniques in                          
              differential as well as computational geometry, nonlinear                      
              control, symbolic computation, dynamical system theory and                     
              free motion planning.  With dexterous manipulation as the                      
              primary goal, criteria for robotic hand design are developed.                  
              The project has an experimental component whereby the design                   
              concepts are implemented on existing actuators.  This                          
              research is expected to impact several fundamental issues in                   
              robotics, including nonholonomic motion planning, coordinated                  
              control, grasping and task planning, geometrical modeling and                  
              finger kinematics and actuator design.
