Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This research will investigate the ability of a large                     
              protein, called nerve growth factor, to promote functional                     
              recovery in rats who have undergone specific brain lesions.                    
              After producing injury to acetylcholine-containing brain neurons,              
              nerve growth factor will be administered into the brain.  Its                  
              effects on both brain biochemistry and on abnormal behavior                    
              produced by the lesioning will be examined.  This work is                      
              important because it will provide information about how specific               
              chemicals may work to promote recovery of function after brain                 
              damage.
