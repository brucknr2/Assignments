Abstract    :
              The research proposed here is to develop a molecular theory                    
              for aqueous solvation of macromolecules.  Specifically, Dr.                    
              Ichiye is interested in the solvation of entire folded                         
              proteins, not just subunits or homopolymers.  The most                         
              straightforward approach to the solvation of macromolecules                    
              would appear to be via computer simulations, such as                           
              molecular dynamics simulations, in which all the solute and                    
              solvent molecules are modeled.  However, when the size or                      
              number of macromolecules increases, this becomes impractical                   
              because of the large number of solvent molecules needed for                    
              sufficient layers of solvation, especially when there are                      
              long-ranged Coulombic forces.  Rather than explicitly                          
              simulating all of the solvent molecules, Dr. Ichiye proposes                   
              to develop analytic theories of solvation which include the                    
              molecular nature of the solvent.  This approach involves                       
              integral equation theories which predict the molecular                         
              structure of liquids given the same intermolecular potentials                  
              as used in computer simulations.
