Abstract    :
                   The objective of this research is an investigation of                     
              gravity waves in the lower atmosphere.  Three problems are posed:              
              (1) roll waves, (2) waves, and consequent mixing, produced by air              
              encountering obstacles in rough terrain, (3) the diurnal                       
              excitation (from heating) of inertio-gravity waves near 30o                    
              latitude.
