Abstract    :
                    Organisms allocate resources to a variety of activities,                 
              such as reproduction, growth, and maintenance, and it is                       
              generally perceived that the allocation of resources to any one                
              activity occurs at the expense of the other activities.  Plants                
              provide an excellent opportunity to determine how resource                     
              allocation strategies are affected by the sex of an individual,                
              as many genera contain species that vary in their sex expression.              
              Within the genus Silene, there are species that are                            
              hermaphroditic (both sexes in one individual) and others that are              
              dioecious (separate male and female individuals).                              
                   It has been shown for one of the dioecious species of Silene              
              that males and females have very different resource allocation                 
              patterns.  Dr. Delph's long-term research plans include                        
              investigating how these differences evolved.  In order to do so,               
              it is necessary to unambiguously determine the sex of plants                   
              early in their development.  At the present time, the sex of an                
              individual can only be determined when it is flowering.  The                   
              grant will provide necessary funds to develop molecular                        
              techniques that would enable sex determination prior to                        
              flowering.  In addition, a protocol for a technique will be                    
              developed to detect differences between the sexes in where                     
              resources for flowering and fruiting originate within the plant.
