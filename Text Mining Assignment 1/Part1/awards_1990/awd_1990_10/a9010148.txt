Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The aim of this project is to study the use of                                 
              a particular non-linear system identification                                  
              scheme to determine the in situ cyclic                                         
              properties of soils, using records of the                                      
              response of such soils to the strong ground                                    
              shaking induced by large earthquakes.                                          
                                                                                             
              Soils are known to exhibit significant non-                                    
              linear behavior even under moderate ground                                     
              shaking.  The degree of this non-linearity can                                 
              have a large effect on the response of soils                                   
              to strong ground shaking, and hence on the                                     
              response of structures founded on these soils                                  
              to the earthquake loading.  The use of non-                                    
              linear system identification methods is                                        
              difficult and any particular scheme is limited                                 
              in its application.                                                            
                                                                                             
              This study is investigating the use of the                                     
              Extended Kalman Filter to identify the in-situ                                 
              cyclic properties of soils existing in shear                                   
              beam type soil structures.  The first phase of                                 
              the research involves a numerical parametric                                   
              study aimed at finding guidelines for such                                     
              issues as: sensitivity of the initial                                          
              estimates, the required number of parameters,                                  
              the effects of measurement noise, the impact                                   
              of ground shaking intensities, and the                                         
              relationship between global iteration and                                      
              convergence.  The second phase applies these                                   
              results to the downhole instrument records                                     
              measured during earthquakes.  Emphasis is                                      
              placed on the consistency of the estimates and                                 
              the accuracy of the estimates in comparison                                    
              with laboratory test data.
