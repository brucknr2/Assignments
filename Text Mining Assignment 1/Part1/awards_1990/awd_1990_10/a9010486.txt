Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Nerve cells utilize calcium ions to convert electrical signals to              
              biochemical changes within the cell.  Electrical activity causes               
              an increase of intracellular calcium in the cell.  Once inside,                
              calcium acts as a messenger, carrying information to various                   
              parts of the cell's interior.  Only during electrical                          
              stimulation, or during certain pathologies, is the calcium                     
              concentration in the cell elevated.  Under normal resting                      
              conditions, the intracellular calcium concentration is kept very               
              low by a complex series of pathways which pump calcium out of the              
              cell.  The purpose of this research is to characterize the                     
              processes which remove calcium from nerve cells.  The                          
              investigator is interested in determining which pathways are                   
              present in nerve cells and how calcium's relative contribution                 
              changes with the size of a calcium challenge.  This study will                 
              examine calcium levels during various levels of electrical                     
              activity and locate the various calcium pathways in the cell.                  
              Nerve cells will be grown individually in culture and examined by              
              using optical and electrophysiological instrumentation developed               
              by the investigator.  This inquiry will increase the                           
              understanding of how nerve cells process information at the                    
              molecular and cellular level, revealing new target for drugs and               
              insight into the mechanisms of certain neurodegenerative                       
              disorders caused by calcium overload.
