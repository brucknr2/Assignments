Abstract    :
              The object of this project is to investigate the                               
              monolithic integration of different optoelectronic                             
              devices on a AlGaAs/GaAs quantum well wafer.                                   
              MBE growth on patterned GaAs substrate and                                     
              focused ion beam etching techniques will be                                    
              used to achieve the coupling between the                                       
              different devices.  In this respect, concentrated                              
              efforts will be on the following two structures:                               
              (a) Monolithic integration of laser-amplifier                                  
              structure to obtain high output power; and (b)                                 
              Monolithic integration of MQW laser and                                        
              passive waveguides.
