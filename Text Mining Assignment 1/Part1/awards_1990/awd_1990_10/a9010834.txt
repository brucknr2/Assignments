Abstract    :
              The objectives of this project are to examine and develop new                  
              observation and information extraction techniques for synthetic aperture       
              radar (SAR) images of terrain.  These techniques extract surface               
              roughness information on a spatial scale on the order of the radar             
              illumination wavelength using diversity measurements of speckle patterns       
              arising in the imaging of the observed surface, where diversity can be         
              in the form of frequency, position, or polarization diversity.  Hence,         
              rather than viewing speckle as a corrupting noise in the SAR imaging           
              process, image speckle is used as a carrier of information on the imaged       
              surface.  These techniques have the potential of providing surface             
              roughness characteristics on a much smaller scale than the typical             
              spatial resolution cell of SAR imagery, greatly enhancing the geological       
              measurement capabilities of SAR terrain images - one of the major uses         
              of SAR.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              These techniques involve the extension of optical speckle metrology            
              techniques for determining the surface roughness characteristics of            
              surfaces illuminated by laser light.  This involves extending optical          
              speckle models to SAR imaging at microwave frequencies and extending           
              speckle metrology techniques to provide useful new surface information         
              under the constraints of airborne and spaceborne SAR platforms.  The           
              resulting techniques are tested using computer modeling and real SAR           
              measurements.
