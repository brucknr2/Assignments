Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Many policy analysts recommend higher energy taxes as a way               
              of dealing with environmental problems such as global warming.                 
              An important potential objection to the use of higher energy                   
              taxes is the claim that they are regressive.  Another major                    
              concern is the effect of these taxes on economic efficiency.                   
              Both the progressivity issue and the efficiency issue require                  
              estimates of demand curves or at least elasticities to quantify                
              the effects.  Thus they require specification of a demand                      
              function.  The contribution from this project comes from                       
              developing new nonparametric estimation approaches to estimation               
              of demand curves and the related efficiency measures.  The                     
              progressivity estimates and efficiency estimates obtained using                
              these new procedures will be robust to demand curve                            
              specification.                                                                 
                                                                                             
                   The project will estimate models of gasoline demand using                 
              household data collected by the Department of Energy for the                   
              years 1979 through 1988 where over 18,000 observations are                     
              available.   It will estimate the progressivity effects and                    
              efficiency effects of gasoline taxes by income and expenditure                 
              class and by geographical region to.  The project will also use                
              data from the Department of Energy to estimate the demand for                  
              consumer durables.  Durables such as air conditioners and                      
              refrigerators have both important environmental effects and                    
              energy using effects.                                                          
                                                                                             
                   The methodological research on nonparametric estimation of                
              demand functionals has four parts:  the comparison of parametric               
              and nonparametric approaches for demand curve estimation,                      
              derivation of exact welfare measures in the nonparametric case,                
              derivation of asymptotically normal sampling distributions for                 
              welfare measures in the nonparametric case as well as the                      
              parametric case, and analysis of the sensitivity of the welfare                
              measures to components of nonparametric regression estimators                  
              such as kernel choice and window width.
