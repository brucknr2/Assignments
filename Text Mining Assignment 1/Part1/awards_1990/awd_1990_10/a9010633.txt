Abstract    :
              This project examines representation in the U.S. Senate from                   
              three perspectives.  These are:  (1) at the level of individual                
              voter decisions where new work will improve explanations of voter              
              choice and assess certain problems with reports of the vote in the             
              National Election Studies; (2) development of parallel models for the          
              explanation of election outcomes; and, (3) the interaction of candidate        
              behavior and changes in electoral coalitions over time.                        
                                                                                             
              This multi-level approach is designed to bridge the micro-macro gap of         
              the voting and elections literature.  Studies of voter decision making         
              and studies of legislative policy making have not been integrated, but         
              proceed at fundamentally different levels.  The focus on coalitions,           
              how voters join and defect from them in response to candidates, and how        
              changes in coalitions affect incumbent behavior in Congress, promises          
              to provide the needed linkage between citizens and the behavior of             
              their elected representatives.  By linking the micro decisions of              
              citizens with the macro-level policy behavior of elected officials,            
              this study should increase our understanding of the representative             
              process in the United States - -  one of the fundamental processes of          
              democratic governance.                                                         
                                                                                             
              The study will examine almost 100 races for the U.S. Senate over the           
              period 1982-1990.  Data sources include the National Election Studies,         
              CBS/New York Times election day exit polls, content analysis of home           
              state newspaper campaign coverage, and incumbent roll call scores on           
              various policy indices.
