Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research is focused on the effects of social stigma on self               
              concept.  The basic idea is that social stigma create a defensive              
              state of interpretive ambiguity on the part of the stigmatized                 
              person, and that this ambiguity reduces the positive impact of                 
              success, and often undermines motivation to succeed.  Thus,                    
              programs designed to provide successful experiences for                        
              stigmatized persons might, in fact, have paradoxical effects on                
              their self-concepts.  The studies undertaken here will provide                 
              important information about the manner in which stigma influences              
              people's lives, and, perhaps more importantly, will suggest ways               
              in which inappropriate (mis)interpretations which stigmatized                  
              individuals use to defend themselves psychologically can be                    
              overcome.  The implications of this research for understanding                 
              the effects of stigma are very important.  Even more important                 
              are the implications of the research for understanding the ways                
              in which the effects of stigma might be overcome.
