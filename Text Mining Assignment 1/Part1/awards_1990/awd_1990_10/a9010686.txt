Abstract    :
              This Research Initiation Award is for theoretical and                          
              experimental work in robotic parts assembly.  The theoretical                  
              research will identify information invariants for simple                       
              manipulation tasks: inherent assembly-time tradeoffs between                   
              sensing, action, and prediction.  Dr. Erdmann will then test his               
              theory on a robotic parts-orienting system, with sensing and                   
              manipulatory tasks decomposed along information-invariant                      
              boundaries.  This research could lead to improved manufacturing                
              design as well as reliable and efficient parts assembly.
