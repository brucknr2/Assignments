Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The objective of this work is to develop a new class of                        
              computer-based methods for the estimation of properties of                     
              organic compounds from their molecular structure.  It is                       
              planned to develop the ABC approach which is based on the                      
              contributions of Atoms and Bonds in the properties of                          
              Conjugate forms of a molecular structure.  Although conjugates                 
              are extensively used in organic chemistry to draw qualitative                  
              conclusions on the stability and chemical properties of a                      
              compound, they have been completely ignored in property                        
              estimation for chemical engineering purposes.  Although an                     
              initial focus will entail simple thermodynamic properties,                     
              such as the heat of formation, the quantum-mechanical basis of                 
              this approach should permit the estimation of other physical                   
              properties, fractional charges on individual atoms of the                      
              compound, and electron densities and strengths of individual                   
              bonds.  These properties of molecular fragments will in turn                   
              lead to quantitative prediction of intermolecular interactions                 
              and chemical properties of compounds.  Thus, ABC will                          
              ultimately allow accurate and general estimation of a wide                     
              variety of properties, and thus more efficient analysis and                    
              design of products and processes.
