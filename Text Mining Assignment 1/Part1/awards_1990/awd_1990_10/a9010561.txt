Abstract    :
              The fundamental surface chemical interactions involved in the                  
              epitaxial growth of gallium arsenide from organometallic                       
              precursors are investigated using molecular-beam scattering                    
              techniques and surface-sensitive probes such as electron                       
              diffraction and photoelectron spectroscopy.  Supersonic beam                   
              techniques are a powerful means to probe adsorption, the                       
              prerequisite to epitaxy.  Behavior of the adsorbed                             
              intermediates on the surface, including reaction, diffusion,                   
              and decomposition, are assessed by modulated beam techniques                   
              and by modulation of surface temperature.  Several                             
              crystallographic orientations are studied.  Attempts are made                  
              to synthesize adsorbed decomposition products such as hydrogen                 
              and carbonaceous species in order to assess their influence on                 
              the growth kinetics and the composition of the film.                           
                                                                                             
              This work provides the fundamental information needed to                       
              develop processes for more precise and uniform production of                   
              gallium arsenide crystals for microelectronic applications.                    
              The data produced will also find use in the simulation of                      
              existing processes employing epitaxial growth.
