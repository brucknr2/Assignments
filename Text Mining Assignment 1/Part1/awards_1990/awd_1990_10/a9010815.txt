Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Cruise 11/5 of the F.S. METEOR to the Weddell Sea and the                      
              Southernmost section of the South Atlantic Ocean has been                      
              proposed and scheduled by a team of investigators led by Dr.                   
              Wolfgang Roether, with a U.S. scientific contingent led by Dr.                 
              William Smethie.  This work covers two distinct topics:  (1)                   
              hydrographic support services specifically required and                        
              requested by the investigators, in this case sampling and                      
              analyses for oxygen and nutrients from all rosette casts during                
              the exercise, and (2) a WOCE Hydrographic Program CTD                          
              acquisition and processing inter-group technical comparison and                
              training exercise.  A side benefit of the CTD exercise is ODF                  
              processing of CTD data from the expedition, in parallel to that                
              carried out by the German CTD group.
