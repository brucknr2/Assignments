Abstract    :
              Most past research on the youth employment effects of the minimum              
              wage focuses only in men, or makes no distinction between men and              
              women. The aim of this project is to fill this gap in our                      
              knowledge by examining the labor market experience of the 6,398                
              young women survey in the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth                
              (NLSY).                                                                        
                                                                                             
              A measure of employment effects will be the time it takes to get               
              a first job after leaving school. If the young woman drops out                 
              of the labor market or has difficulty finding a job after leaving              
              school, the effects are likely to persist in alter life. Hence,                
              this first spell  of non-employment is of intrinsic interest. In               
              later work, subsequent employment histories will be analyzed and               
              the as will the determinants of the decision to terminate or                   
              continue schooling.                                                            
                                                                                             
              The results of the research will be of interest for a umber of                 
              reasons. First, little is known about the effects of the minimum               
              wage on the employment of young women. Second, there has not been              
              any work on employment effects of the minimum wage which uses                  
              recent American data. The NLSY also includes much more detailed                
              information about the family and community background of the                   
              teenagers than previous studies have been able to take into                    
              account. Finally, the NLSY over-samples blacks and hispanics so                
              it will be possible to do a detailed analysis by race.
