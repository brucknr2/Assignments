Abstract    :
              This is a basic investigation into the mechanisms by                           
              which a coating of calcium phosphate ceramics enhances                         
              bone tissue ingrowth.  Four clearly stated hypotheses                          
              will be tested using in vitro preparations to examine                          
              bioactivity of these materials.  Resolution of the                             
              hypotheses should substantially improve capability to                          
              design surfaces for bone prostheses without requiring the                      
              use of bone cement.  Since breaking down of the cement is                      
              the primary failure mechanism of current implants, the                         
              work has great potential significance.
