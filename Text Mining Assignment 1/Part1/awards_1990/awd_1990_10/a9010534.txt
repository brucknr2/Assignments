Abstract    :
              This project investigates a variety of problems in the design and              
              analysis of combinatorial algorithms, including the behavior of local          
              search algorithms for combinatorial optimization problems,                     
              approximation algorithms for NP-complete problems, space-efficient             
              data structures, persistent data structures, applications of the               
              Bellman-Ford shortest paths algorithm, and algorithms and lower bounds         
              for parameterized optimization problems.  The main thrusts of this             
              research are finding new ways to store and search discrete                     
              combinatorial data efficiently, and showing that known combinatorial           
              search algorithms cannot perform well in the worst case.  The theme            
              that unifies the problems under consideration is that all have a               
              graph-theoretic aspect and an algorithmic aspect.
