Abstract    :
              The objectives of this project are to develop a receptor                       
              modeling method that explicitly accounts for the                               
              fractionation in chemical composition of volatile organic                      
              carbon compounds that occurs in transit from emission-                         
              sources to the receptor location.  The project also                            
              includes the design of a field study that will                                 
              simultaneously provide data for receptor modeling,                             
              evaluation of the performance of the model, and its use in                     
              conducting an inventory of volatile organic carbon                             
              releases to the environment.                                                   
                                                                                             
              This is a Research Planning Grant made to support a                            
              proposal submitted in response to the Program                                  
              Announcement, NSF 87-56, Research Opportunities for Women.                     
              This project addresses an important issue in determining                       
              the effect that emissions of volatile organic compounds                        
              have on air quality.  Completion of the preliminary phase                      
              outlined in this proposal is expected to provide the                           
              information that is needed to support a field study                            
              intended to assess the validity of the  model developed in                     
              this project.
