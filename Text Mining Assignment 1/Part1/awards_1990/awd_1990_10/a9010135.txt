Abstract    :
              Effective support for analysis, verification, and testing requires             
              coordinated application of a variety of techniques.  As the                    
              difficulties of analyzing concurrent software are especially severe,           
              so it is especially important that multiple techniques be brought to           
              bear on the problem.  This project will develop and demonstrate a              
              general approach to integrating analysis techniques applied to the             
              detection of synchronization faults in concurrent software.  A set of          
              tool components for analysis of concurrent programs will be embedded           
              in a software development environment.  A reachability analysis                
              technique will be used to detect classes of faults  (race conditions,          
              for instance) that are particularly difficult to detect with other             
              analysis and testing techniques.  A new technique for divide-and-              
              conquer analysis will be implemented.  Flexible control of                     
              effort/accuracy tradeoffs and the option of filtering reports of               
              potential errors through other analysis and testing techniques will be         
              used to control the shortcomings of reachability analysis as a stand-          
              alone technique.  The concurrency analysis tool set will serve as an           
              experimental test-bed for investigating novel combinations of                  
              techniques, including integration of reachability analysis with                
              symbolic execution.
