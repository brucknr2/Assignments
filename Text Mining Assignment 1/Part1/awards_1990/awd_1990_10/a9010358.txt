Abstract    :
              The performance of sequential computers in its rapidly expanding fields        
              of image processing and vision has been found to be inadequate since           
              most applications require processing of the image frames in real time.         
              With the rapid growth in VLSI technology and advances made in parallel         
              processing, the obvious solution is to design parallel algorithms and          
              architectures that can be implemented using VLSI and WSI technology.           
              The focus of this research is on the design and testing of VLSI                
              architectures and chips for a set of very important image processing and       
              vision problems.  The problems being investigated are:  1) scale space         
              computation; 2) edge and corner detection; 3) connected component              
              labeling; 4) dynamic scene analysis and 5) image compression.
