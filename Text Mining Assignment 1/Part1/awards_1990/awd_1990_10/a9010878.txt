Abstract    :
              This research explores parallel architectures that unify classical AI          
              and parallel distributed processing.  Parallel architectures for               
              classical AI (symbolic processing) are based on abstract machines for          
              the    -calculus or first order logic.  They differ greatly from               
              connectionist (sub-symbolic) architectures which are based on                  
              abstractions of biological systems, such as Hopfield's model of the            
              neuron.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              Earlier research by the Principal Investigator suggests that a new class       
              of systolic arrays, Lukasiewicz logic arrays (LLAs), support both              
              symbolic and sub-symbolic computation.  These preliminary results are          
              investigated by implementing resolution, back-propagation and adaptive         
              resonance theory algorithms for neural networks, and the RETE algorithm        
              for production system on an LLA simulatory and a VLSI LLA.  Operational        
              four-cell and 32-cell analog VLSI LLAs were fabricated in January 1990,        
              and will be used to test these algorithms on small data sets.  A more          
              complex 128-cell analog VLSI LLA is being designed as part of this             
              research.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              The results being sought include an improved understanding of the design       
              principles of integrated symbolic and sub-symbolic architectures,              
              characterization of the electrical properties of analog VLSI LLAs,             
              specification of a computational model for LLAs in general, and new            
              algorithms for massively parallel processors based on the LLA model of         
              computation.
