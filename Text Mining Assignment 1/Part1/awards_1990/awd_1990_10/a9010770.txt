Abstract    :
                   A Bayesian formulation of optimization and search problems                
              that are distinguished by very lax assumptions is adopted in this              
              research.  The optimality criterion for algorithms is the                      
              minimization of dispersion of the conditional probabilities with               
              respect to the observations.  The research addresses the                       
              theoretical issues of consistency of optimal myopic algorithms,                
              characterizations of algorithms, and the development of efficient              
              algorithms that are not sensitive to probabilistic assumptions.                
                   Problems of optimization and search with partial information              
              abound.  A common situation is to start with minimal information               
              about the function to be optimized or the object to be found and               
              then make observations that improve our information.  An efficient             
              choice of observations is a difficult and important problem since              
              some choices may be much more informative than others.  While                  
              problems that fit this description are commonplace, there is very              
              little theory to guide in planning sensible strategies since the               
              strong assumptions needed for most optimization or search methods              
              can not typically be justified.
