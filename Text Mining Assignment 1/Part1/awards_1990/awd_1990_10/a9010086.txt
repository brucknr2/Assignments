Abstract    :
                   This research is a feasibility study for the application of               
              oxygen isotopes for interpretation of environmental changes that               
              followed the uplift of the Isthmus of Panama.  Recent molluscs                 
              shells off the Pacific and Atlantic coasts will be analysed in an              
              attempt to distinguish the different environmental regimes.                    
              Should differences be recorded in the shell's isotopic record,                 
              subsequent research with fossil shells will be viable.  Funding                
              will enable pilot project that will strengthen subsequent                      
              proposal from this PI.
