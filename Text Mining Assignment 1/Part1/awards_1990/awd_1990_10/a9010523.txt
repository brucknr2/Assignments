Abstract    :
              This Research Opportunities for Women Career Advancement Award                 
              is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry.                    
              Dr. Rebecca O'Malley of the Chemistry Department of the                        
              University of South Florida will modify and upgrade existing                   
              equipment to convert it to a laser desorption linear                           
              time-of-flight mass spectrometer and will undertake a study to                 
              characterize some conducting polymers.  Preparative work on the                
              polymers, conducting measurements, and optical microscopy will                 
              be carried out in collaboration with Dr. J. Fernandez, also at                 
              the University of South Florida, but laser desorption studies                  
              to determine molecular weight distributions will be carried out                
              in Dr. O'Malley's laboratory.  Dr. O'Malley will also obtain                   
              instruction and consultation regarding this technique in                       
              laboratories of three experts in the field.  Establishment of a                
              program to characterize polymeric materials, including                         
              biopolymers, is expected from this grant so that Dr. O'Malley                  
              will be able to extend her research interests to solids as well                
              as gaseous species.
