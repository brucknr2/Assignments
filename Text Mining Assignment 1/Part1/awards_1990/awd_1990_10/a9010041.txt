Abstract    :
                   This is a research planning grant for the purpose of                      
              supporting Professor Kime's activities to determine the                        
              feasibility of her proposed research.  In addition she will                    
              consult with experts to develop approaches to certain aspects of               
              her proposed project.                                                          
                   The project itself deals with the Schroedinger equation                   
              which describes the quantum mechanical behavior of microscopic                 
              systems.  The dynamics of these systems involves certain applied               
              forces which are described mathematically.  Professor Kime will                
              study how and to what extent these forces can be prescribed to                 
              achieve a desired outcome.
