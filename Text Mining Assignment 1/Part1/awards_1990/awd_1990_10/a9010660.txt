Abstract    :
              This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                      
              continuing work of Dr. Przemyslaw B. Maslak at the Pennsylvania                
              State University.  The results of this investigation will                      
              provide an improved understanding of the relationships between                 
              chemical reactivity and electronic and molecular structure fora                
              highly reactive class of chemical intermediates.                               
                                                                                             
              The experiments that will be carried out by Dr. Maslak will                    
              focus on the unimolecular cleavage of radical ions into                        
              radicals and ions, a processes called mesolysis.  Kinetic and                  
              thermodynamic parameters will be determined for mesolytic                      
              cleavage reactions of sigma bonds in a series of radical ions                  
              that can be generated by photoinduced electron transfer.                       
              Standard redox potentials will be measured for corresponding                   
              radicals, ions, and radical ions.  Experiments will probe the                  
              effects of molecular structure, ion pairing, and solvent on the                
              relationship between activation energy for mesolytic cleavage                  
              and the corresponding free energy change for bond rupture.
