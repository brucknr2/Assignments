Abstract    :
              Sequencing activities, determining activity durations, and                     
              allocating resources to activities are typically performed in                  
              planning and scheduling; locating temporary facilities on site in              
              layout.  It is clear, however, that space availability and its                 
              timing greatly affect activity interaction.  This interaction is               
              primordial to many problems addressed by site managers (e.g.                   
              competition for prime space between contractors, path interference             
              during equipment movement).  These examples show that detailed                 
              construction plans, schedules, and layout necessarily share time               
              and space as variables. However space (and sometimes even time) is             
              ignored entirely in most planners and schedulers developed to date,            
              while temporal variation of the layout is ignored in most layout               
              programs.  PI claims that developing a program taking time as well             
              as space explicitly into account would greatly enhance the realism             
              of construction management models, and would contribute to the                 
              effective integration of planners, schedulers, and layout tools.               
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
              PI will develop an integrated planning-layout system in a                      
              blackboard expert system architecture.  Separate prototypes have               
              demonstrated that such a system is conceptually realizable, but                
              implementation experiments will determine its computational                    
              feasibility.  The research will also implement distributed planning            
              and layout systems that exchange information, and contrast that                
              implementation with the fully-integrated system in order to assess             
              the costs/benefits of integration vs. distribution.
