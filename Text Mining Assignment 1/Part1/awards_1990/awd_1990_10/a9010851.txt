Abstract    :
                   This proposal is to utilize the renormalization group (RNG)               
              method in studies of physical oceanographic processes.  The RNG                
              method consists of parameterizing small scale effects so their                 
              influence is present, but their explicit calculation need not be               
              done.  In the ocean context, the method will be applied to                     
              internal wave dynamics, particularly the Garrett-Munk spectrum.                
              Additional modeling of rotating and stratified flows pertinent to              
              physical oceanography will be done.
