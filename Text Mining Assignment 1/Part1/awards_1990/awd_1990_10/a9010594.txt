Abstract    :
              An experimental investigation is to be conducted, under a                      
              Research Initiation Award, of the mixing layer between two                     
              parallel streams at supersonic speeds.  Optical non-intrusive                  
              diagnostics and pressure measurements will be used to infer                    
              the effectiveness of mixing and the role of shock waves.  A                    
              coordinated computational effort, based on large-eddy                          
              simulation, will also be carried out.                                          
                                                                                             
              Mixing between parallel streams at very high speeds is                         
              essential for the operation of advanced propulsion systems and                 
              the understanding of the organized turbulent flow features                     
              that control the mixing which is necessary for combustion.
