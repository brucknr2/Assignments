Abstract    :
              With this award, the Organic Dynamics  Program will support the                
              research of Dr. Philip E. Eaton of the Department of Chemistry                 
              at the University of Chicago.  Dr. Eaton is recognized for his                 
              syntheses of molecules containing special geometries that force                
              the constituent carbons to rehybridize and adopt unusual                       
              bonding parameters.  These properties produce systems which                    
              provide new insights about the role of bonding in chemical                     
              reactivity.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              Current studies are focused on the synthesis of hexaprismane,                  
              1,3-dehydrocubane, pentaprismane, azahomocubanone, azacubane                   
              and other highly strained molecules.   These compounds will be                 
              characterized  fully by spectroscopy and by their reaction                     
              chemistry.  The dehydrocubanes will be studied in detail using                 
              spectroscopic methods to measure the energy difference between                 
              a very highly twisted olefin and its carbene isomer.  The cubyl                
              carbocation is being investigated in order to determine what                   
              factors make this structure more readily accessible than                       
              originally predicted.
