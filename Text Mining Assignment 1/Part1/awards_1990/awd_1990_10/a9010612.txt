Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This study will explain how different types of living arran-                   
              gements affect future education, employment, and earnings of                   
              teenaged mothers.  Most previous research highlights the negative              
              impact of teenaged child bearing on women's economic status.                   
              However new findings reported by researchers at the University of              
              Pennsylvania who have followed more than 400 teenaged mothers for              
              2 years show that many teenaged mothers break out of poverty by                
              the time they reach midlife.  This study hypothesizes that the                 
              types of households in which teenaged mothers live during adoles-              
              cence is an important determinant of which among them are abler                
              to complete their education, find steady jobs, and become self-                
              sufficient adult.  Data for this study come from a 1979-1988                   
              nationally representative survey that has interviewed several                  
              thousand young people of both sexes annually from adolescence                  
              through their 20s.  This study is significant because it will                  
              show which types of living arrangements promote or inhibit                     
              economic independence following parenthood.  It will show the                  
              importance of social supports in shaping the lives of young                    
              mothers.  Findings will increase understanding of the household                
              structures of young women who are disproportionately at risk of                
              becoming welfare dependent.
