Abstract    :
              An expert musician, when playing with other musicians, is able to              
              listen to simultaneous inputs and synthesize that information in               
              order to decide on the correct position in the musical score.                  
              The research objective of this project is to investigate                       
              algorithms that would allow an artificial system to simulate this              
              real-time tracking ability.  A working computer performer,                     
              capable of playing intractively with live musicians, and                       
              implemented on multiprocessor, will be the vehicle for testing                 
              and developing the tracking algorithm.  Since the computer                     
              performer will need to examine complex patterns of notes from                  
              several sources and also to inspect simultaneously several                     
              possible locations in the musical score, parallel processing and               
              pattern matching considerations will be important.  This research              
              will provide insight into methods of parallel processing and                   
              pattern matching; will give musicians a new, practical                         
              interactive tool for performance; and will be an innovative                    
              application of multiprocessors.
