Abstract    :
              This award is in support of a workshop being held to bring                     
              together all investigators with seismic-reflection data (all                   
              types) and drill core data from the Antarctic continental                      
              margin.  The purpose is to study global processes (e.g.                        
              changes in sea level, Antarctic glaciation, bottom-water                       
              currents, etc.) that are recorded in offshore Cenozoic                         
              sedimentary sequences proximal to Antarctica.  The workshop                    
              is also intended to promote international cooperation in                       
              this and future offshore seismic studies, and to identify                      
              critical areas for offshore geologic sampling.
