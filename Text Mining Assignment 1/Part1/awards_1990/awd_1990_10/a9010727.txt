Abstract    :
              The objectives of this proposed research are twofold:                          
              1) to investigate the impact of high spatial density dynamic                   
              measurement and rotational degrees-of-freedom measurement on                   
              dynamic structural modification, 2) to develop an optimal degrees              
              of freedom in the experimentally derived dynamic model.  This work             
              will result in a more informationally complete dynamics model which            
              should be able to predict the response of proposed modifications               
              on the structure.  The modifications to the structure will be                  
              realized by synthesizing a structural element that generates the               
              desired response based on prescribed design goals and constraints.             
              Results from the field of structural optimization will be applied              
              to the experimental dynamics model to make the design trade-offs.
