Abstract    :
              Under a Research Initiation Award, Computational Fluid                         
              Dynamics (CFD) will be carried out for compressible viscous                    
              flows.  The accuracy and efficiency of a pseudospectral method                 
              utilizing an adaptive algorithm will be tested with the one-                   
              and two- dimensional Navier Stokes equation.  In two                           
              dimensions, the flow will be that over a rearward step with                    
              flow separation.  The flow will be supersonic.                                 
                                                                                             
              The research will enhance the computational predictability,                    
              and physical understanding, of very high speed flows with                      
              friction over and through engineering systems.
