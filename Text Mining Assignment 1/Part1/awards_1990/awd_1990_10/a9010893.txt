Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                             
                  In this project, the investigators use computational                      
              techniques and multivariate statistical techniques to trace                    
              linguistic changes in English over the last four centuries.  The               
              study analyzes a computerized corpus of 1,500 texts (3,000,000                 
              words), representing 17 speech-based and written registers.  The               
              computational techniques and large corpus allow analyzing change               
              along multiple parameters of variation and uncovering patterns of              
              greater scope, accuracy, and reliability than would be possible                
              otherwise.  Specific undertakings will be:  1.  descriptions of                
              the linguistic characteristics of speech-based and written                     
              registers in English for each of the last four centuries; 2.                   
              diachronic analyses of the changes within and among these                      
              registers; 3.  comparison of developments across British and                   
              American English; and 4.  'explanations' of the observed                       
              developments in terms of changes in social attitudes,                          
              demographics, and purposes of communication (including the                     
              expanded range of uses for written language).                                  
                                                                                             
                   Although numerous studies have analyzed differences between               
              speech and writing in English, apart from the earlier work by the              
              PIs no study has analyzed differences in earlier periods or                    
              traced the linguistic evolution of written styles.  The research               
              advances the multi-feature/multi-dimensional model of variation                
              developed in their earlier studies.  This model provides an                    
              empirical basis for analyzing the evolution of registers in                    
              relation to the expansion of literacy uses in English; and it                  
              lays a foundation for cross-linguistic comparisons, thus enabling              
              investigation of universal tendencies of register development                  
              over time.
