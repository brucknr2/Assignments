Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The self-concept is the outcome of a number of forces, including               
              no doubt, the culture within which the concept develops.  If                   
              cultures differ, then the self-concepts of inhabitants of the                  
              cultures should differ too. If this is so, then the system of                  
              rewards, of interdependencies, of fitting-in, achieving, etc.,                 
              should differ as well.  This research, focused on American and                 
              Japanese respondents, is an attempt to test these possibilities.               
              The goal of the 12 studies of the project is to lay the                        
              groundwork for understanding differences in the ways in which the              
              fundamental reward systems work cross-culturally.  The                         
              implications of this research for understanding important                      
              cultural differences, and for understanding ways in which                      
              cultures might be brought into more effective communication, are               
              vast.  The research team on the project is first-rate, and there               
              is little doubt that this project will provide results of immense              
              importance, both in terms of fundamental social psychological                  
              theory and application.
