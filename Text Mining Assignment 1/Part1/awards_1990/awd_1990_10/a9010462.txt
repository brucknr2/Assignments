Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Three investigators will study problems involving the                     
              structure of non-negatively curved manifolds, geodesics, minimal               
              real Kaehler submanifolds, collapse with bounded curvature,                    
              adiabatic limits and small eigenvalues of the Laplacian, and                   
              rigidity properties of Riemannian manifolds and semisimple                     
              groups.                                                                        
                   These investigators will analyze various aspects of the                   
              problem of understanding all curved manifolds.  This general                   
              problem has been the central theme of differential geometry since              
              its conception over one hundered years ago.  Specifically, these               
              investigators will study the behavior of geodesics along curved                
              manifolds.  On the surface of a sphere, great circles are the                  
              only geodesics.  But on other more complex surfaces, geodesics                 
              can take on many surprising properties.  The study of geodesics                
              has particular application to cosmology since according to                     
              Einstein's theories, each of us moves through four-dimensional                 
              space-time along a geodesic.
