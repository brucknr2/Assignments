Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                This proposal is to study the role of a specific neural                     
              pathway in the spinal cord and medulla of the brainstem in the                 
              control of the sympathetic nervous system.  The uniqueness                     
              of this proposal is that the PI can identify a specific neural                 
              pathway by two chemical identifiers.  Some pathways contain                    
              serotonin and some contain thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH)                 
              but only one pathway contains both and it is by the combined use               
              of these transmitters that the pathway can be recognized and                   
              defined.  The study should add greatly to the accuracy of our                  
              understanding of brain control of the sympathetic nervous system.
