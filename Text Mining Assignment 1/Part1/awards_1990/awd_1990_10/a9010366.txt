Abstract    :
              Term rewriting systems form an important computational paradigm in             
              programming languages, abstract data type specification and                    
              verification, automated deduction and computer algebra.  The theory of         
              rewriting has developed rapidly, and new application areas are being           
              explored.  However, not much is known about the computational aspects          
              of rewrite operations.  In this proposal the basic operations in               
              rewriting, and the means to design and analyze efficient algorithms            
              for them, will be studied.  Practical algorithms will be designed on           
              both sequential and parallel machines.                                         
              Algorithms, which learn efficiently from their history, will be                
              designed for important and useful classes of rewrite systems.  Several         
              facets of the matching problem will be studied from a novel                    
              perspective.  The practical performance of the designed algorithms             
              will also be investigated. This investigation will be useful in                
              improving the efficiency of rewrite-based systems as well as provide           
              understanding of the inherent complexities and limitations of the              
              rewrite approach.
