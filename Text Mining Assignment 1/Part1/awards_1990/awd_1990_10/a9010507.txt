Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator with his collaborator S. Kwapien               
              will study new methods for comparison of sums of independent                   
              random variables, martingale difference sequences, subordinated                
              sequences, and other dominated sequences.  The techniques that                 
              will be employed exploit the concepts of tangency, decoupling                  
              and hypercontractivity.  These methods are applied to study of                 
              continuous time stochastic processes and single and multiple                   
              stochastic integrals.
