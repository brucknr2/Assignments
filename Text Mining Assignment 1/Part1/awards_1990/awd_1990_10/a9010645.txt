Abstract    :
              This work focuses on the study of coordination between AI                      
              systems.  One objective is to take techniques developed for                    
              different aspects of coordination and unify them in a single                   
              computational theory.  Initially, the work will develop a                      
              formalism and computational theory that can lead to novel                      
              coordination techniques by drawing together the separate                       
              approaches of planning, organizational design, and scheduling.                 
              This theory provides a powerful framework for improving                        
              performance, reducing overhead, increasing reliability, and                    
              flexibly managing distributed resources among AI systems.  The                 
              work will lead toward a generic coordination framework for                     
              developing AI systems, because we believe that reasoning about                 
              interactions with others is fundamental to intelligence.                       
              A second objective of DIAL is to build an experimental                         
              infrastructure for validating coordination theories and                        
              discovering new theories.  To facilitate comparisons between                   
              alternative theories both within DIAL and elsewhere, a versatile,              
              portable simulation testbed will be developed.  Techniques will                
              also be integrated into actual mobile robots to investigate the                
              interplay between sensing, acting, reasoning, and communicating                
              in real-time physical systems.  The research will help pave the                
              way for introducing intelligent, cooperating robots into real-                 
              world environments.
