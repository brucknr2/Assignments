Abstract    :
                                                                                              
              Support is awarded for a one day symposium on "Computational                  
              Approaches to Comparative Neurobiology" during the American                    
              Society of Zoologists in San Antonio, Texas in December 1990.                  
              The symposium will introduce new ideas and methods to zoologists               
              interested in a wide range of studies in neurobiology of behavior              
              of vertebrates and invertebrates.  Rather than a course on                     
              computer generated mathematical modelling in these systems,the                 
              symposium will bring together active researchers using the                     
              techniques to show how it can be done.  The conference will be                 
              educational and the proceedings will be published.
