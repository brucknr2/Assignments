Abstract    :
              The objective of this research is the development of the                       
              theory of lattice transformations as used in image                             
              processing and the application of the theory to two                            
              specific areas: mapping lattice transforms to special                          
              architectures, and the development of morphological                            
              neural networks.  Lattice transforms, which include the                        
              transforms of mathematical morphology, are described by                        
              minimax algebra, a mathematical structure that mimics                          
              many properties of linear algebra.  A high-level image                         
              processing language called image algebra provides the                          
              link between minimax algebra and lattice transforms.                           
                                                                                             
              This research proposes to extend the mathematical                              
              foundations of minimax algebra in areas which will                             
              advance solutions to image processing problems.                                
              Specifically, decomposition techniques will be developed                       
              that will increase the tools available for mapping lattice                     
              transforms to parallel and sequential architectures with                       
              reduced computation.  The initial investigation will seek                      
              to mimic linear techniques using minimax algebra.  Also,                       
              a theory of novel neural computation involving                                 
              morphological-type operations will be broadened by                             
              developing training rules and identifying-applications for                     
              this new type of neural network.                                               
                                                                                             
              The significance of the proposed research to the state-                        
              of-the-art is that it aims to increase the theoretical tools                   
              available for performing lattice-related image processing                      
              analysis in two important areas, transform decomposition                       
              and neural computing.
