Abstract    :
              This research involves the extension of methods recently developed by          
              the principal investigator in the area of narrowband passive array             
              processing.  The approach involves using real steering vectors rather          
              than traditional complex steering vectors which will allow the                 
              processing of more signals than was previously possible and/or the             
              processing of signals in the presence of arbitrary noise amplitude             
              distributions.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              The first phase of research involves the extension of these methods to         
              wideband passive array processing; thus, taking advantage of the entire        
              frequency support of signals which may not necessarily be narrowband.          
              The second phase will be the development of efficient methods to               
              implement both the narrowband and the wideband algorithms and,                 
              consequently, making these methods practical from a computational              
              viewpoint.  This phase will rely on methods in numerical nonlinear             
              optimization theory which have not previously been applied to array            
              processing problems.
