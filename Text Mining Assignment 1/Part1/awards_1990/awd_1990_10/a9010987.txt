Abstract    :
              The Delmarva Peninsula is a particularly appropriate location for              
              a research program in Environmental and Quaternary Geophysics.                 
              The rise and fall of sea level during the Quaternary is                        
              abundantly evidenced in this area by relict strandlines and                    
              barrier-spit deposits from previous relative sea-level maxima and              
              buried paleochannels of the Susquehanna and Delaware river                     
              systems from several relative sea-level minima.  These features                
              have been identified and mapped offshore and in the Chesapeake                 
              and Delaware Bays using marine seismic data.  The continuation                 
              and geometry of these features on land can be estimated from well              
              data where available but high-resolution seismic reflection data               
              on land is required to accurately map them and to characterize                 
              their boundaries and internal structure in detail.  The mapping                
              and stratigraphic positioning of these features allow us to                    
              better reconstruct climatic change in the Quaternary and to                    
              understand the impact of sea-level rise or fall on coastal                     
              features.  The paleochannels hold an additional interest                       
              environmentally, in that the coarse materials within the channels              
              may act as preferred pathways for the transport of fluid media,                
              including fluid contaminants.
