Abstract    :
              This Research Initiation Award will support Dr. Hansen's research              
              in speech recognition under conditions of noise and stress.                    
              Initial simulations show that stress compensation can improve                  
              Markov-based recognition rates by as much as 42% (over a 60%                   
              decrease due to noise and stress).  Dr. Hanson has collected a                 
              database of over 16,000 stressed and unstressed utterances,                    
              including speech from psychiatric patients and from people                     
              enduring high acceleration forces.  His data also include                      
              examples of the Lombard effect, in which individuals modify their              
              speech to overcome environmental noise.
