Abstract    :
              This Research Initiation Award is for the application of Markov                
              random field (MRF) theory to interpretation of image features.                 
              Although probabilistic and constraint based interpretation                     
              systems are not new, they remain a promising direction for high                
              level computer vision.  Dr. Zhang will give special attention to               
              energy based design of clique potentials for hierarchical object               
              recognition.
