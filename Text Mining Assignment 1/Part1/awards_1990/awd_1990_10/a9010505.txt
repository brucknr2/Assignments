Abstract    :
              This grant is in the general area of analytical and surface                    
              chemistry and in the subfield of bioelectrochemistry.                          
              Professor Heller will study the fundamental aspects of electron                
              transfer by enzyme immobilized biosensors.                                     
                                                                                             
              This research will use synthetic strategies developed by                       
              Professor Heller's group to prepare novel enzyme systems that                  
              have electrically conductive redox couples attached within the                 
              fabric of the enzymes.  Electrochemical methods will be used to                
              evaluate the electron transfer properties of these modified                    
              enzymes while immobilized on electrode surfaces.  This research                
              will have relevance to the development of new analytical                       
              biosensors for use in a range of problems areas.
