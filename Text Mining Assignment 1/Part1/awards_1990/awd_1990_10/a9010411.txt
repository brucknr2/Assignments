Abstract    :
                   The domain inadequacy of current solid modellers can be                   
              alleviated by incorporating the natural quartics - a useful                    
              subset of degree four algebraic surfaces.  Such a class of                     
              quartics exist in the Dupin cyclides.  They can be rationally                  
              parameterized and their offsets are trivial to compute.                        
              Furthermore, they are a superset of the natural quadrics and the               
              torus.  The objectives of this research are:  (i) to extend the                
              geometric coverage of solid modellers by incorporating the                     
              natural quartics; (ii) to enable the application of such solid                 
              modellers in automated inspection systems of manufacturing cells               
              employing coordinate measuring machines.
