Abstract    :
                This is a Research Planning Grant to enable Dr. Braas to                     
              initiate independent studies of peptide biosynthetic enzyme                    
              expression in hypertension and hyperactivity, using inbred                     
              strains of rats which express spontaneous hypertension as a model              
              system.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              It is anticipated that this award will help Dr. Braas obtain the               
              preliminary results necessary to launch an independent research                
              career.
