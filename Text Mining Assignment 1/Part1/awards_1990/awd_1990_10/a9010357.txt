Abstract    :
              This Research Initiation Award is for theoretical and                          
              experimental research in visual tracking of non-rigid 3-D motion.              
              Images of left-ventricle heart data will be used to test theories              
              of 3-D image analysis using local curvature changes to fit                     
              analytic surface models.  Application domains include radar,                   
              sonar, X-ray tomography, cineangiography, and magnetic resonance               
              imaging, as well as human face recognition and studies of                      
              material deformation.
