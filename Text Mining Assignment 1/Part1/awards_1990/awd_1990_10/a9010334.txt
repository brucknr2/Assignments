Abstract    :
              The goal of this proposal is to develop a computer-based                       
              visual display to teach articulation to hearing impaired                       
              children.  Speech will be analyzed to discriminate                             
              phonemes, and then the phonemes will be encoded to provide                     
              pleasing and interesting feedback to the subjects.                             
              Psychophysical experiments will be conducted to determine                      
              to what extent speech can be discriminated and identified                      
              based on the display.  The project should contribute to                        
              speech analysis, and if successful, it will also have a                        
              significant impact on the training of hearing-impaired                         
              children.
