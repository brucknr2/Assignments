Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This work involves a balanced theoretical and experimental                     
              program designed to relate the microscopic properties of                       
              collections of magnetic particles to their macroscopic response                
              to a magnetic field.  This fundamental research has potential for              
              application in the magnetic recording industry.  The research                  
              group receives substantial matching funds from the Center for                  
              Magnetic Recording Research at UC San Diego.  The theoretical                  
              work applies finite element analytical methods, as well as an                  
              integral equation approach, to micromagnetic behavior.  A wide                 
              variety of experimental methods are employed.  They range from                 
              modern nano-scale lithographic methods to an innovative use of                 
              the classical Millikan oil-drop technique.  The latter is used to              
              levitate a magnetic particle in an oil bath and measure its                    
              magnetic moment.  Further research is devoted to the important                 
              problem of inter-particle interactions across contact asperities.              
              This topic is being investigated by high resolution electron                   
              microscopy with collaborators at UC Berkeley.
