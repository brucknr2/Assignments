Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research addresses singularity issues in robotics.  It                    
              analyses new types of manipulation systems with the goal of                    
              eliminating all singularities.  The class of actuator                          
              considered is the symmetrically actuated double pointing                       
              system (SADPS).  A configuration using SADPS joints both                       
              for shoulder and wrist motion is analyzed.  The resulting                      
              manipulation system is expected to be singularity free.                        
              The research comprises four steps, including (1) derivation                    
              of kinematic equations of motion for this manipulation                         
              system, (2) determination of the Jacobian matrix of the                        
              system, (3) determination of singularity configurations,                       
              and (4) development of preliminary mechanical designs.  The                    
              expected improvement in dexterity would imply greater                          
              manufacturing flexibility in industrial robotic systems.
