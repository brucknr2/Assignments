Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is an enzyme that plays a very                     
              important role in the communication between nerve and muscle, by               
              breaking down acetylcholine, the chemical neurotransmitter                     
              released by the motor nerve, and terminating its action.                       
              Butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) is a very closely related enzyme                 
              whose function is still unknown.  Both of these enzymes are                    
              present in higher chordates (vertebrates).  The principal                      
              investigator found that the cholinesterase (ChE) of amphioxus, a               
              primitive chordate, has properties intermediate to AChE and                    
              BuChE.  The principal investigator suggests that this                          
              ChE resembles the ancestral esterase and that AChE and BuChE have              
              appeared as a result of a gene duplication event early in                      
              chordate evolution, with subsequent structural and functional                  
              divergence of the two enzymes.  The principal investigator plans               
              to investigate this hypothesis by using biochemical and                        
              pharmacological techniques to study the ChE activity of three                  
              primitive organisms -- the agnathan vertebrate Petromyzon,                     
              the cephalochordate amphioxus, and the urochordate Ciona, and by               
              using the techniques of recombinant DNA technology to investigate              
              the genes coding for these enzymes, and their sequence                         
              similarities to the genes for AChE and BuChE from higher                       
              organisms.  These studies will provide a detailed picture of the               
              cholinesterases from these organisms at the protein and nucleic                
              acid levels, and should provide information about the evolution,               
              structure/function relationships, and genetic regulation of the                
              enzyme.
