Abstract    :
              This is a RUI proposal to involve undergraduate                                
              engineering students in neurophysiology research.  The                         
              project is to record from cells of the hippocampus of                          
              freely-moving rats during the preweaning and postweaning                       
              periods.  The responses to paired electrical stimulation                       
              will be used to characterize the development of                                
              facilitatory and inhibitory modulation of the studied                          
              cells.  The proposed project is unique in that                                 
              neurophysiological correlates of behavior can be obtained                      
              by the use of unanesthetized and freely moving animals.                        
              The research will lead to an improved understanding of                         
              the basic physiology of maturation, and it will also                           
              involve engineering undergraduates in significant life                         
              sciences research.
