Abstract    :
              The aim of this study is to make a contribution towards                        
              development of formaldehyde-free bonding agents for paper.                     
              The basis will be the reaction of paper fibers with                            
              polycarboxylic acids which have at least three carboxyl units                  
              that are structurally capable of thermal intramolecular                        
              cyclic anhydride formation (Blanc' Rule).  The detailed                        
              curing mechanism will be determined and the effects of                         
              processing variables and catalysts will be evaluated.  The                     
              structure and properties of the resulting paper will be                        
              determined and used to develop relationships between                           
              chemical, mechanical and moisture properties.
