Abstract    :
              Thin-layered structures of both aluminum nitride on silicon                    
              carbide and silicon carbide on aluminum nitride are developed                  
              by heteroepitaxial chemical vapor deposition.  Silicon carbide                 
              in the beta form is produced initially by converting the                       
              surface of a silicon substrate to silicon carbide, and by                      
              chemical vapor deposition with silane and ethene.  Epitaxial                   
              aluminum nitride is produced by metalorganic chemical vapor                    
              deposition.  The stabilities of these structures are evaluated                 
              with annealling studies and thermodynamic modelling.                           
              Materials produced are characterized with X-ray diffraction,                   
              Rutherford backscattering spectrometry, scanning electron                      
              microscopy, and secondary-ion mass spectroscopy.                               
                                                                                             
              A reduction in the crystal defect density in expected for                      
              epitaxial aluminum nitride layers on silicon carbide, while                    
              epitaxial silicon carbide layers on aluminum nitride should be                 
              electrically isolated from the substrate.  This research will                  
              result in improved structural and electrical quality of these                  
              semiconductors, increasing their potential for applications in                 
              electronic and optoelectronic devices.
