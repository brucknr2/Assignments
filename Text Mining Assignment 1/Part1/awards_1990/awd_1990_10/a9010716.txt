Abstract    :
                 This is a Career Advancement Award to support Dr. Petersen's                
              sabbatical visit to the laboratory of Dr. Mary Lou Pardue at MIT.              
              Dr. Petersen will take advantage of constructs and techniques                  
              currently available in Dr. Pardue's laboratory to study the                    
              putative role that heat shock RNA may play in regulating protein               
              synthesis following heat shock.  These experiments will provide                
              Dr. Petersen the opportunity to acquire familiarity with a                     
              variety of modern molecular biology techniques which will be                   
              applied directly to her own research program.                                  
                                                                                             
              Given the depth of experience Dr. Petersen already has in the                  
              stress response field, the acquisition of these new techniques                 
              and approaches are anticipated to significantly enhance her                    
              career.
