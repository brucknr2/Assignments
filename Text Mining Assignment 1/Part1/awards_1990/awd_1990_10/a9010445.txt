Abstract    :
              The main objective of the project is to develop a research plan in the         
              area of parallel algorithm design aiming to gain a better                      
              understanding of how and when parallel computers can help solve                
              problems faster than sequential ones.  Efficiency of parallel                  
              algorithms for a given problem is measured by the ratio of the time            
              needed by the best known sequential algorithms for the same problem            
              and the product of the time and number of processors used in the               
              computation.  When the ratio is a constant, the parallel algorithm is          
              called efficient.  An emphasis of the research is to design efficient          
              parallel algorithms for some graph problems.
