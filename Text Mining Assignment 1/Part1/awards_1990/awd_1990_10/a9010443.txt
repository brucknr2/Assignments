Abstract    :
              Modeling microeconomic transaction costs is essential for a                    
              better understanding of the behavior of most macroeconomic                     
              variables over time like consumer durables, business investment,               
              inventories, employment, and prices.  In order to obtain a                     
              genuinely structural interpretation of the time series properties              
              of these variables, a careful treatment both of the underlying                 
              microeconomic problem and of the aggregation process is                        
              necessary.  Available microeconomic models of dynamic adjustment               
              in the presence of realistic transaction costs predict that                    
              individual units should not react to every innovation in their                 
              environment, and that they may react discontinuously to those                  
              innovations that trigger adjustment of variables determined by                 
              the model.  The purpose of this research is to extend available                
              models of infrequent microeconomic adjustment, to analyze their                
              implications for aggregate phenomena, and to test these                        
              implications and assess their quantitative relevance.  This                    
              research is important because it will provide a better                         
              understanding of the degree to which transaction costs at the                  
              micro level might provide a plausible microeconomic foundation                 
              for explaining the business cycle.
