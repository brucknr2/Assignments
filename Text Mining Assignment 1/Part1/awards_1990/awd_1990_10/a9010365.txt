Abstract    :
              This project implements mechanisms for cooperation and                         
              communication within and between complex database transactions                 
              with the aim of increasing the degree of parallelism as well as                
              the level of recovery control during failures. A transaction is                
              defined as a partially ordered set of primitive database                       
              operations. The approach exploits the spatial properties of a                  
              multidimensional data structure, the Interpolation-Based Grid                  
              File (IBGF), which represents objects --points, boxes, or                      
              otherwise. It provides a capability to learn important access                  
              path information from live processes, prior to accessing the                   
              data, and a technique to allow sharing of this information among               
              processes. Throughput will be greatly improved by using this                   
              capability to anticipate potential conflicts and to reduce access              
              redundancy. This research will develop servers, responsible for                
              any transaction on the IBGF structure, which incorporate this                  
              access path information passing capability. A transaction manager              
              will be built on top of IBGF servers. Methods developed by other               
              researchers will be modified to take advantage of IBGF spatial                 
              properties to improve performance. The portability of the results              
              to a commercially available system such as INGRES will be                      
              considered. The results provide tools for the design of advanced               
              transaction systems.
