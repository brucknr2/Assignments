Abstract    :
                 This is a Research Planning Grant to enable Dr. Cook to                     
              initiate independent studies aimed toward a comparison of                      
              responses to different stresses (heat, salinity) in a family of                
              related plants (marrow and okra).                                              
                                                                                             
              It is anticipated that this award will help Dr. Cook obtain the                
              preliminary results necessary to launch an independent research                
              career.
