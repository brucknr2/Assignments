Abstract    :
              People are often faced with decisions involving uncertain outcomes.            
              Rather than making judgments in accord with probability theory,                
              past research suggests that people use a limited number of                     
              heuristics.  There has been little research, however, on the                   
              process by which heuristics are selected.  This proposal for a                 
              Research Planning Grant examines the question of when each                     
              heuristic is used.                                                             
                                                                                             
              The principal investigator proposes that people have multiple                  
              heuristics, but that one occupies a default position.  The plan is             
              to development an experimental methodology for measuring heuristic             
              use in probability judgment.  This methodology will be used to                 
              examine factors which influence heuristic selection.  The project              
              will identify conditions which can improve the accuracy of                     
              probability estimation and enhance the quality of decisions                    
              involving uncertainty.
