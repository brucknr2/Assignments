Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Jackson State University (JSU) and the Gulf Coast Research                     
              Laboratory (GCRL), which is part of the University of Southern                 
              Mississippi, plan to develop a strong five.year, collaborative                 
              program to increase the number of minority students pursuing                   
              marine science degrees and professional careers.  The primary                  
              objectives are: increasing the number of minority students                     
              entering the field of marine science; enhancing the marine                     
              science program at JSU; strengthening the minority recruitment                 
              program at GCRL; and increasing the exposure of pre.college and                
              high school teachers to marine science. Pilot studies and other                
              activities which will lead to long term increases of minority                  
              students pursuing graduate careers in marine sciences will be                  
              pursued.
