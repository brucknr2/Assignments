Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to study the                                  
              photocatalytic oxidation of several representative organic                     
              contaminants of water as they are affected by altering the                     
              properties of the catalyst used in this process.  The                          
              catalyst selected for this research project is titanium                        
              dioxide.  The catalytic properties of this substance will                      
              be altered by subjecting it to various physical and                            
              chemical processes that alter its surface characteristics.                     
                                                                                             
              The proposal leading to this award was submitted under                         
              conditions in the NSF Program Announcement titled:                             
              "Research Initiation Awards," NSF 88-99.  The project                          
              addresses the problem of removing relatively small                             
              concentrations of organic pollutants from aqueous                              
              solution.  The ultimate goal is a process for                                  
              decontamination of water and removal of organics from                          
              wastewater that utilizes solar energy to drive the                             
              oxidation process.  Results of this project may be applied                     
              in engineering design of water and wastewater treatment                        
              processes and systems.
