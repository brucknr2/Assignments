Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The factors that contribute to a person's willingness to give                  
              his or her life for altruistic or nationalistic reasons is the                 
              focus  of this research.  In this study, the PI will interview                 
              75-100    Janbaz - Iranian soldiers who volunteered for                        
              repeated suicide    missions, and survived.  Autobiographical                  
              reports, trait measures, and other inter- and intrapersonal                    
              assessments should   yield some very interesting and                           
              potentially useful insights into  behavior under extreme                       
              environmental stress.  Equally of interest will be the                         
              soldiers' rationalizations of their "failure," along  with                     
              their retrospective accounts of their contribution to their                    
              country.  This population offers a very rare opportunity to                    
              study first-hand the antecedents of exceptional altruism.  Most                
              populations of this type do not survive the activity for which                 
              they volunteered, of course, and thus, the Janbaz offer a rare                 
              and important opportunity for research.  This study has the                    
              potential to contribute to the store of fundamental knowledge                  
              about behavior under extreme stress, and the antecedents of                    
              this  form of selfless altruism.  It promises to enrich the                    
              insights of researchers across many of the social sciences.
