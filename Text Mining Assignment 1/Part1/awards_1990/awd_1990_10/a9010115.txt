Abstract    :
                   The proposed research described in this application is                    
              concerned with understanding the chemical machinery that                       
              underlies 24-hour (circadian) cycles.  Circadian cycles are                    
              common in the plant and animal kingdom and organize a number of                
              important processes including sleep and waking in humans.  The                 
              biochemical mechanisms that generate such a long cycle are not                 
              known.                                                                         
                                                                                             
                   The investigations will use a model system, the eye of a                  
              marine mollusc Aplysia.  This eye has all the machinery for                    
              expressing many cycles of a circadian rhythm of nerve impulse                  
              frequency, under constant conditions of darkness and temperature,              
              when isolated from the rest of the animal.  The principal                      
              investigator will use biochemical and physiological methods to                 
              generate data about the mechanisms of this neuronal circadian                  
              cycle.  The major approach will be to study the timing of                      
              appearance of particular proteins during the circadian cycle.                  
              From the amino acid sequence of these proteins the principal                   
              investigator will synthesize oligonucleotide probes which can be               
              used to clone the gene messages that code for these proteins.                  
              These studies will begin to us what genes and proteins are being               
              expressed specifically during the circadian cycle.
