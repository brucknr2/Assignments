Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This Research Opportunity for Women Career Achievement Award will              
              support a cultural anthropologist who has had a productive                     
              research career in studying tropical indigenous hunters and                    
              gathers in the Bolivian Amazon.  This award will allow this                    
              scientist to develop her expertise by studying tropical ecology                
              at the University of Florida, and by putting her knowledge of new              
              ecological techniques to immediate use by continuing her research              
              in lowland Bolivia on the foraging activities of two indigenous                
              groups.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              This project is important because it will expand the scientific                
              expertise of a female cultural anthropologist, allowing her to                 
              serve as a role model for women considering a career in science.               
              In addition the new knowledge she will gain on ecological methods              
              will allow her to collaborate more productively with biological                
              ecologists.  Knowledge of the foraging activities of indigenous                
              peoples is important because they may have adaptive procedures                 
              that will help us understand how to conserve to tropical forest.
