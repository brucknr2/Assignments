Abstract    :
              This research investigates complexity theory from the point of view of         
              boolean circuits with an emphasis on the area of lower bounds.                 
              Boolean circuits are natural models of parallel computation. The depth         
              of circuits corresponds to parallel time while the size of circuits            
              corresponds to the number of processors.  Viewed from complexity               
              theory, the size of boolean circuits corresponds to time in Turing             
              machines.  Thus questions such as P=NP? or NC=P? will be solved,               
              perhaps, only after a better understanding of how to prove lower               
              bounds to the complexity of boolean functions is obtained.  This is            
              the main objective of this project.
