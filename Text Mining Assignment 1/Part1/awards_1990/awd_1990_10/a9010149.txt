Abstract    :
              A mutant for variegated flower color in the Japanese Morning Glory             
              will be investigated for the presence of a transposable element.               
              The hypothesis states that the unstable nature of this mutant is               
              due to a transposable element.  The mutation will be studied and               
              the putative transposable element isolated, cloned and sequenced.              
              The study of transposable elements in this model system will                   
              provide information valuable to those wishing to develop conscious             
              gene tagging strategies.
