Abstract    :
              This research addresses the communication structure of MIMS (multiple          
              instruction, multiple data) distributed memory parallel computer               
              systems.  The goal of this work is to develop fault tolerant                   
              structures for high capicity, low latency interprocessor                       
              communication that significantly reduces the system complexity from            
              current interconnection techniques.  The proposed method to achieve            
              this objective is through the incorporation of optical                         
              interconnections.                                                              
                                                                                             
              Data packets are routed through intermediary nodes in current                  
              distributed memory systems.  The latency incurred at each step due to          
              the buffering, address decode, routing and transmission is                     
              significant.  Care must be taken by communicating processes so the             
              latencies are not severe.  Self-routing single-step optically                  
              interconnected communication structures can be designed through the            
              incorporation of agile laser diode sources and wavelength tunable              
              optical filters in a wavelength division multiple access environment.          
                                                                                             
              This allows multiple high-bandwidth channels on a single physical              
              link.
