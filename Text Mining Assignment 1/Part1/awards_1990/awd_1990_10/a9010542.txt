Abstract    :
              This is a ROW-CAA proposal with the objectives of devising an                  
              experimental model for liquid-particles flow near a porous                     
              wall, and testing existing theories by comparing with                          
              experimental data.  The work will be conducted in                              
              collaboration with City College of New York.                                   
                                                                                             
              The proposed research aims to clarify the mechanisms that                      
              contribute to the "exit concentration defect" in shear flow of                 
              a particulate suspension over a porous wall, with practical                    
              implications in fluidization, membrane filtration and blood                    
              circulation.
