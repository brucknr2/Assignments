Abstract    :
              The goal of this research is to develop novel techniques for the               
              analysis of filtered discrete self-similar signals and investigate their       
              application in speech modeling and recognition, image texture                  
              segmentation and object recognition based on contour information.              
              Specifically, filtered discrete self-similar signals are used as tools         
              for modeling both the long term and short term characteristics of              
              signals of interest and novel multiscale algorithms for estimating their       
              parameters are constructed.  A multiscale solution to the problem of           
              finding an iterated function system whose attractor best approximates          
              a given M-D curve in the Hausdorff measure is also being developed.            
              Particular attention will be given to parallel implementation of the           
              algorithms.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              Filtered discrete self-similar signals are also studied as models for          
              speech signals with particular emphasis on the naturalness of the              
              produced speech.  Furthermore, their parameters and the parameters of          
              iterated function systems approximations to speech demisyllables are           
              tested for use as feature vectors in speech recognition systems.  M-D          
              experiments are also being performed to investigate the usefulness of          
              M-D filtered discrete self-similar signals and iterated function systems       
              in texture segmentation and object recognition tasks.
