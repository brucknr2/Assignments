Abstract    :
              This project will attempt to advance our fundamental                           
              understanding of Hopfield neural networks - - a class                          
              of artificial neural network designed to minimize                              
              complicated functions of a large number of variables.                          
              Hopfield networks solve these problems very quickly,                           
              and have been applied to problems like the traveling                           
              salesman problem (i.e., efficient routing systems), the                        
              N-queen problem, bearing estimation, robot path                                
              finding, robot arm positioning, content addressable                            
              memory, and others.                                                            
                                                                                             
              Unfortunately, Hopefield nets are only guaranteed to                           
              converge to a local minimum.  Other techniques have                            
              been developed to explore the solution space                                   
              stochastically,  to look for better solutions far away                         
              from this local minimum; however, these techniques                             
              may be expensive.  The P.I. here will be extending his                         
              recent work on a different approach - - to find                                
              conditions which insure that the Hopfield net will in                          
              fact find a global minimum, and exploit these                                  
              conditions in applications such as radar and sonar                             
              detection.
