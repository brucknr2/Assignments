Abstract    :
              The objectives are:                                                             
                                                                                            
              1) to review and compare design codes for the ultimate strength of             
              certain common tubular joints for offshore structures and 2) to                
              analytically study the behavior of the above joints when subjected             
              to loading combinations for which test data is lacking.                        
                                                                                             
              The strength of tubular joints is important for the design of                  
              offshore structures. Design guidelines have been based upon                    
              compilations of test data for simple configurations and loading                
              conditions.  An analytical approach is necessary to evaluate and               
              extend the design equations to more complex situations, for which              
              little or no test data exists.  The finite element method has been             
              applied, but only to cases in which fracture does not occur.  The              
              analysis for the proposed work includes a continuum damage                     
              mechanics material model that enables it to consider general cases.            
                                                                                             
              A series of tubular joints of typical dimensions will be analyzed              
              for ultimate strength under various loads and loading combinations.            
              Load interaction relationships will be evaluated where they exist              
              and proposed where they are lacking.
