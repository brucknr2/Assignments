Abstract    :
              Research is on high level synthesis tools that translate a program-like        
              behavioral description into a design suitable for implementation.  The         
              tools must meet designer constraints, especially timing constraints,           
              while producing high quality designs.  The research is being done in           
              three phases.  First, algorithms are being developed to produce an             
              initial schedule that meets timing constraints, thus providing a               
              starting point for the synthesis process.  Second, a new framework is          
              being developed for synthesis and design exploration using simulated           
              annealing.  The framework represents scheduling and allocation decisions       
              and provides a set of moves that will modify designs while maintaining         
              all timing constraints.  Third, it is planned to expand the framework          
              to incorporate physical design information and to provide a bridge to          
              logic synthesis tools.
