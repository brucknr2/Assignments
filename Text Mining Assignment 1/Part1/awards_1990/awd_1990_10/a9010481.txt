Abstract    :
              An equipment award will support purchase of state-of-the-art                   
              surface profilometry instrumentation.  The equipment will be                   
              used to validate the P.I.'s theoretical models for surface                     
              roughness of machined and worn surfaces and for additional                     
              research on surface generation and characterization.
