Abstract    :
                Information Technology (IT) capital currently represents 7%                  
              oftotal capital stock in the U.S. and accounts for a                           
              rapidlygrowing share of capital expenditures, making it one of                 
              the mostimportant innovations of recent times.  Surprisingly,                  
              fewtheoretical or empirical analyses have focussed on the                      
              diffusionof IT and in particular, quantified its growth.  Given                
              thesignificant role of IT as a capital input in every sector of                
              theeconomy, it is important to analyze these growth trends.                    
                This project studies the demand for IT capital for the                       
              period1972.1987 at both the industry and the aggregate economy                 
              levels. While much of the literature refers to the growth of IT                
              in thecontext of the diffusion of innovation and S.curve                       
              behavior, itis argued in this project that the declining costs of              
              computingwill have a significant impact on the pattern of                      
              diffusion.  Theresearcher develops economic models of the demand               
              for IT thatintegrate these two factors.  The models also examine               
              theinfluence of other factors, including the cost of labor                     
              andgeneral business conditions on the demand for IT.  The quality              
              ofthe models, and their form and parameters are determined                     
              throughan econometric analysis of data on the stocks and flows of              
              IT atthe industry and aggregate economy levels.  The research                  
              examinesthe extent to which the growth of IT stock can be                      
              explained bythe effects of the innovation diffusion versus the                 
              price effects. The Principal Investigator looks at the                         
              relationships between theaggregate and the industry demand                     
              functions as well as inter.industry differences.
