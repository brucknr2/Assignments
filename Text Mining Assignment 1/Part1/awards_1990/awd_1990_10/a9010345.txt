Abstract    :
              Metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) is a versatile                  
              technique for depositing materials for microelectronics                        
              fabrication, including metals, semiconductors, and insulators,                 
              using a variety of organometallic precursors.  In a typical                    
              pyrolytic MOCVD process, a mixture of reactive gases is                        
              injected over a heated solid substrate and a thin solid film                   
              is deposited.  MOCVD is a promising technique for depositing                   
              thin epitaxial layers and heterostructures of III-V and IIV                    
              compound semi-conductors such as GaAs, AlGaAs, InP, InGaAs,                    
              InGaAsP, ZnSe, HgCdTe, etc.  The problems that are currently                   
              limiting commercial applications of MOCVD for growing thin                     
              films of compound semi-conductors and artificial                               
              microstructures (superlattices, quantum wells, and atomically                  
              abrupt compositional and doping interfaces) are:(1) lack of                    
              understanding of the underlying gas-phase and surface                          
              reactions, (2) lack of understanding of the coupling between                   
              chemical kinetics and complex transport phenomena that                         
              determines the growth and compositional uniformity of the                      
              material, and (3) safety issues arising from the high toxicity                 
              of commonly used precursor gases, especially of the group-V                    
              hydrides arsine and phosphine.                                                 
                                                                                             
              The objectives of this research is: (a) to study the                           
              decomposition kinetics of alternative (safer) arsenic                          
              precursors (trimethyl-arsine, tertiary-butyl-arsine) and                       
              common organo-metallic precursors (trimethyl- and triethyl-                    
              gallium and aluminum) used in MOCVD of GaAs and AlxGa1-xAs;                    
              (b) to develop reaction-transport models of GaAs growth from                   
              alternative arsenic precursors capable of predicting observed                  
              growth and carbon incorporation rates; (c) to grow GaAs                        
              epitaxial layers from the above precursors and study their                     
              properties.  The decomposition of the precursors will be                       
              performed in a counterflow diffusion reactor to obtain purely                  
              homogeneous reaction rates and in a hot-wall tubular reactor                   
              to obtain overall rates.  The ultimate goal of this research                   
              is to develop procedures for efficient scale-up of the MOCVD                   
              process for depositing thin epitaxial layers of GaAs from                      
              safer precursor gases and with controlled uniformity,                          
              composition, and morphology.
