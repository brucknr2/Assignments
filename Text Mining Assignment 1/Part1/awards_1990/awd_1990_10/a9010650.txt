Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will investigate the behavior of a slab-on elastic                
              foundation with respect to combinations of slabs, and subjected to             
              several time prints.  The results will generalize the current                  
              procedures.  The investigation will consider extrusive data bases              
              of analytical, numerical and experimental results.
