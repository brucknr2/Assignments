Abstract    :
              User interaction with computers has long been on an individual                 
              basis with little or no help to support cooperative work.                      
              Applications such as office information systems, design endeavors              
              in CAD/CAM and VLSI, programming in-the-large, and decision                    
              support systems require users to collaborate.  Currently, there                
              is no framework to specify correctness of concurrent actions in a              
              cooperative environment and to design protocols for cooperating                
              transactions. The goal of this research is to use semantic                     
              information to develop a framework for controlled sharing of                   
              information, i.e., transaction-oriented cooperation.  A                        
              preliminary version of a framework for transaction-oriented                    
              cooperation has been developed. In this project, this framework                
              is extended to include different types of transactions and to                  
              handle failures of individual transactions in a cooperative                    
              environment. In addition, the aim is to build a prototype                      
              application that uses an object-oriented database to validate the              
              framework and demonstrate its practicality.  Results of this                   
              work, are expected to provide an effective approach to developing              
              distributed applications that require cooperation.
