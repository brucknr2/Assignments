Abstract    :
                   Most engineering mathematics is appropriate for representing              
              a single object under a single operating condition.  Mechanical                
              designers, however, must reason simultaneously about many design               
              possibilities; that is, sets of objects under sets of operating                
              conditions.                                                                    
                   Previous work has produced a formalism for performing such                
              inferences, called the labeled interval calculus.  This formalism              
              has been empirically validated in a mechanical design compiler, a              
              program which for a wide range of design problems accepts                      
              mechanical schematics, specifications, and utility functions, and              
              returns catalog numbers for optimal implementations.  However, the             
              tested version of the calculus is relatively complex, and has been             
              only partially analyzed mathematically.                                        
                   The researcher seeks to simplify the calculus, develop precise            
              definitions for all its terms and proofs for all its inferences,               
              and clarify a number of issues surrounding it.  This will enable               
              the development of more powerful and reliable compilers, as well               
              as furthering the basic understanding of design reasoning.
