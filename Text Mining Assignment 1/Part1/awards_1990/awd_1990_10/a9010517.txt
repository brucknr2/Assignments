Abstract    :
              This project is concerned with the design and analysis of randomized           
              algorithms while treating randomness as a resource.  Various                   
              techniques for reducing or eliminating the use of randomness in both           
              parallel and sequential algorithms will be analyzed.  The approach             
              involves constructing sample spaces of sub-exponential size and then           
              using efficient search techniques to reduce the number of random bits          
              needed to sample from this space.  A complementary approach is to              
              study the interaction between specific pseudo-random generators and            
              classes of algorithms.  To identify the limitations of such                    
              techniques, trade-offs between the use of randomness and other                 
              resources such as space and time will be studied.  An important part           
              of the project is the application of techniques to the efficient               
              solution of combinatorial problems which arise in fields such as               
              computational geometry and learning theory.                                    
                                                                                             
              The use of randomness and probabilistic methods has led to significant         
              theoretical developments in almost every area of computer science.             
              However, there are no sources of true randomness and the cost of               
              generating high-quality random bits is prohibitive.  In this research          
              a methodology for reducing the dependence of algorithms on randomness          
              while maintaining their performance quality will be developed.
