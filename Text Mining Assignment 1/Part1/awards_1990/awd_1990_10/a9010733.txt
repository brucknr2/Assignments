Abstract    :
              An analytical and numerical study of longitudinal vortices                     
              along heated walls will be carried out under a Research                        
              Initiation Award.  These vortices, generated by concave wall                   
              curvature, are known as Gortler vortices, and they can enhance                 
              wall transfer.  The study will explore details related to                      
              instability and wall transfer under strongly non-isothermal                    
              conditions.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              Enhanced effectiveness of transport into the wall, both of                     
              heat and mass, from the flow over a surface even in laminar                    
              flow conditions is of potential utility in reducing the size                   
              and weight of heat exchangers and chemical systems.
