Abstract    :
              This research is to design and                                                 
              fabricate frictionless microbearings                                           
              for use in various micro-                                                      
              electromechanical systems (MEMS).                                              
              Recently, a variety of micromotors                                             
              and a host of other small actuating                                            
              devices have been proposed and                                                 
              fabricated, using silicon and other                                            
              precision micromachining techniques.                                           
              Because these devices themselves are                                           
              so small, the design and development                                           
              of bearing and linear guides become                                            
              an extremely arduous task, and have                                            
              not been successfully demonstrated.                                            
              However, microbearings and                                                     
              microguides are an essential                                                   
              component of any micromachine and                                              
              must be developed.  It is believed                                             
              that due to the minuscule sizes                                                
              involved, successful bearing would                                             
              take radically different forms from                                            
              those of conventional bearings in                                              
              the macro scales and may involve                                               
              innovative concepts.  The proposed                                             
              research involves one of such                                                  
              different and potentially innovative                                           
              designs.  It employs a resonant                                                
              electric suspension to achieve open                                            
              loop stable levitation in all three                                            
              directions.  The advantages of the                                             
              proposed designs include complete                                              
              compatibility with electrostatic                                               
              micromotors and low power                                                      
              consumption requirements.  The                                                 
              proposed suspension can be developed                                           
              with available components and can be                                           
              successfully utilized as                                                       
              microbearings and microguides in                                               
              various designs of micromotors.
