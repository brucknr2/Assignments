Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The major issue in the study of animal learning has been the                   
              processes involved in how an animal associates two events with                 
              each other.  The traditional answer to this question has been                  
              that such associations are formed automatically because the two                
              events occur at the same time, or one event occurs just before                 
              the other.  But we now know that such an answer is too simple,                 
              because the strength of the association depends critically upon                
              the context of events in which the two events occur.  For                      
              example, if an animal is presented a pairing of sound with food,               
              the likelihood of a sound-food association may vary, depending                 
              upon whether or not other events in the conditioning environment               
              have a pre-existing association with food.                                     
                                                                                             
              Dr. Williams will analyze the behavioral processes underlying                  
              such contextual effects, for a variety of different conditioning               
              procedures.  Such analysis is important because basic                          
              conditioning processes have been used increasingly in studies of               
              neural organization with primitive animals (e.g., Aplysia) and                 
              now form the basis of neural-network models that constitute the                
              major theoretical development in human cognitive psychology in                 
              the past decade.  Thus, a proper understanding of how contextual               
              effects are mediated has major implications for several different              
              areas of psychology and physiology.
