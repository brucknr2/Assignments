Abstract    :
              Ocean scientists from the United States academic research community            
              will be supported to participate in activities of the International            
              Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) which are of special             
              interest to this community and the ocean science programs in which             
              it is involved.  These ICES activities will include the annual ICES            
              Statutory Meeting; meetings of ICES Working Groups; and scientific             
              workshops and planning meetings.  During the first year of this                
              award, U.S. scientists will be supported to participate in meetings            
              of ICES Working Groups on shelf hydrography; marine chemistry;                 
              benthic ecology; multi-species models; larval fish ecology;                    
              biological effects of environmental changes; and phytoplankton                 
              management.
