Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This complements a recently-funded project to deply biweekly                   
              sediment traps for two years on the eastern and western sides of               
              the Gulf of California which will cover work on bulk fluxes,                   
              planktonic foraminifera, radiolaria and stable isotopes.  This                 
              study will concentrate on four preservable groups of                           
              phytoplankton microfossils--diatoms, silicoflagellates, dino-                  
              flagellates and calcareous nannofossils.  Fluxes of each taxon                 
              will be determined, and the composition of the trap-based                      
              material compared with that of underlying surface sediments                    
              recovered by box cores.  The study will examine the seasonal                   
              succession of phytoplankton, and the internannual and spatial                  
              variation thereof, in order to determine the degree to which the               
              original seasonal signal is preserved in the sediments.  Changes               
              in phytoplankton will be examined at 1000 year intervals                       
              throughout the cored section, on eastern and western sides, to                 
              address questions concerning changes in seasonal upwelling and                 
              evidence for changed precipitation and river runoff.  The study                
              will expand upon a model being developed to describe the                       
              transformation of biocoenosis to taphocoenosis for diatoms, and                
              produce a first-range model for calcareous nannofossils and                    
              silicoflagellates.
