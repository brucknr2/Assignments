Abstract    :
              As large-scale, distributed systems are used in safety-critical                
              applications, the fault tolerance of these systems becomes a crucial           
              issue.  This research focuses on the fundamental problems of diagnosis         
              and fault-tolerant routing.  This work will, for the first time,               
              consider the coordination of these important tasks, by making use of           
              diagnostic information to increase routing efficiency and system               
              throughput.  The work will target systems possessing a relatively              
              sparse interconnection structure such as grids, meshes, and hypercubes         
              which constitute a large fraction of existing systems and are                  
              expected to dominate future applications.  The proposed research will          
              involve the integrated design of algorithms for diagnosis and routing,         
              along with evaluations of algorithm performance that are both                  
              theoretical and experimental in nature.  The theoretical work will             
              utilize probabilistic analysis techniques in order to evaluate                 
              performance under recently proposed probabilistic models as well as to         
              examine performance limits for these systems.  The experimental work           
              will involve the implementation and testing of the proposed algorithms         
              on 32-node Intel IPSC/2 hypercube. A product of this research should be        
              efficient algorithms for these fundamental problems in distributed             
              fault tolerance that can be used in a wide range of                            
              multiprocessor/multicomputer systems.
