Abstract    :
              This Research Opportunities for Women Research Planning Grant                  
              is in the general area of organic chemistry.  Dr. Cynthia K.                   
              McClure of the Chemistry Department of the University of                       
              Delaware will explore two different methods for the synthesis                  
              of the nitrogen heterocyclic substructures of alkaloids.  One                  
              method is the photochemical oxa-di-pi-methane rearrangement of                 
              amides and other nitrogen-containing compounds to produce                      
              pyrrolizidine and indolizidine alkaloid skeletons.  The second                 
              method involves the addition of radicals to the nitrogen of                    
              imidate esters to form a new carbon-nitrogen bond under                        
              non-ionic conditions.  If successful, these methods could be                   
              used in the total synthesis of biologically active alkaloids                   
              and their analogs and a proposal for sustained study in that                   
              area could be developed.
