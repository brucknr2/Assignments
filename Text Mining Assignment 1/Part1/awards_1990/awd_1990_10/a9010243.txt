Abstract    :
              The manner in which a key source of information is presented or                
              "framed" appears to have an effect on judgments and decisions that is          
              both powerful and generalizable.  While initial work in the                    
              investigator's laboratory supported the robustness of this effect,             
              their recent research suggests that a variety of mediating factors may         
              influence the effect of information frame.  A central theme of this            
              program of research is to use information framing manipulations to             
              understand the interactive effects of a variety of factors that                
              influence judgments and decisions.  The proposed studies will attempt          
              to move beyond demonstrations of framing effects to provide empirical          
              evidence of mediating factors, develop models that incorporate these           
              factors, and provide implications for understanding individual and             
              managerial decision making.
