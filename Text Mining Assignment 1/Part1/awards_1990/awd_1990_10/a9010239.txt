Abstract    :
                   The objectives of this project are the synthesis of                       
              digitally implemented demodulator architectures which achieve                  
              near ideal coherent digital communication performance in the                   
              frequency nonselective slow fading channel.  Coherent digital                  
              communication performance provides a 3 dB improvement over the                 
              most commonly utilized fading channel demodulation architecture,               
              differentially coherent detection.  Digitally implemented                      
              architectures are the best method of achieving this coherent                   
              performance since they possess many practical and theoretical                  
              advantages.                                                                    
                   The first stage of this project focuses on the development                
              of generalized algorithms for carrier estimation and symbol                    
              demodulation.  This work is developing phase estimation                        
              algorithms optimized for the fading channel and a carrier with                 
              frequency uncertainty.  In the second phase symbol timing                      
              estimation and joint phase and symbol timing estimation on the                 
              fading channel is being investigated.  The work will help produce              
              modems with near optimal performance on the fading channel with                
              many practical advantages.
