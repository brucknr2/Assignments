Abstract    :
              The goal of the program is to develop research activities in the               
              design of neural network structures in the implementation of                   
              distributed processing of stochastic data, dictated by                         
              statistical techniques.  The processing is to be directed at the               
              basic operations common to communications, information, and                    
              decision oriented system:  detection or hypothesis testing and                 
              parameter estimation.  Probability of error, generalized Chernoff              
              bounds and related parameters will be used as performance                      
              criteria.  Establishment of a group of researchers in this area                
              is a secondary goal.
