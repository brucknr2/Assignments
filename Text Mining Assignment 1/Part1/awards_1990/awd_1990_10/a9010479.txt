Abstract    :
              An experimental investigation of atomization in a liquid spray                 
              is to be carried out under a Research Initiation Award.  The                   
              research is relevant to fuel systems in internal combustion                    
              engines.  A transparent, two-dimensional model atomizing                       
              orifice will be utilized, and turbulent fluctuations will be                   
              measured with laser-Doppler anemometry.                                        
                                                                                             
              The information to be developed may lead to systems with                       
              better and more complete fuel evaporation, and hence lower                     
              emission levels in internal combustion engines.
