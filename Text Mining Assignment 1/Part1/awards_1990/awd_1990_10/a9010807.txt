Abstract    :
              The purpose of this conference is to promote communications between            
              microelectronics educators, industry personnel, and government who are         
              interested in improving microelectronics education.  Particular emphasis       
              is given to upgrading undergraduate microelectronic systems education          
              in primarily undergraduate institutions.  This is the third annual             
              conference with expanded scope in topics, participants and activities.
