Abstract    :
              Holographic interferometry will be used to study the                           
              formation of surface roughness during plastic deformation of                   
              metals.  The development of the roughness will be followed                     
              in detail for spheroidized 1090 carbon steel and will be                       
              related to strain, strain rate and environmental effects, in                   
              particular the presence of hydrogen.  The technique will                       
              subsequently be adapted to the in situ study of roughness                      
              development on tribological surfaces.
