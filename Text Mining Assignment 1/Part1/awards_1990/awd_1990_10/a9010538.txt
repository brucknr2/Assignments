Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A central issue in developmental neurobiology concerns what                    
              factors are involved in the differentiation of ion channels in                 
              developing neurons.  This issue will be studied in migrating                   
              neurons that form the enteric nervous system in the moth,                      
              Manduca.  This system is uniquely suited for such studies since                
              the developmental fates of these neurons are well characterized,               
              there are only 300 neurons in this system and these are easily                 
              accessible for electrophysiological recording and experimental                 
              manipulation in the embryo.  In addition, these neurons can be                 
              removed from the embryo and studied in culture.  Intracellular                 
              and patch clamp recordings will be performed on identified                     
              neurons during and after their migration in situ and in culture                
              to study the expression and development of voltage dependent                   
              potassium, calcium dependent potassium, sodium and calcium                     
              currents.  These studies will lead in the future to molecular and              
              genetic analyses of channel gene expression.
