Abstract    :
              The long-range goal of this project is to develop a theory of how              
              people experience and react to climate variation.  While a number              
              of researchers have explored people's views and values on                      
              environmental issues, there is virtually no empirical work on how              
              people experience climate.  This proposal is to explore                        
              individuals' perceptions of climate and climate change, along                  
              with their reactions to some concrete policy options.  These                   
              reactions will be obtained through an interview survey in which                
              "micro-climate" scenarios and policy packages are presented to                 
              1500 adults from the Los Angeles area.  The questionnaire will be              
              designed for a factorial experiment.  Four parameters of an                    
              underlying micro-climate temperature or precipitation                          
              distribution will be varied by random assignment.  Likewise, the               
              policy packages will be constructed by randomly selecting four                 
              proposals from a much larger list.  This is to be a pilot study                
              to determine the feasibility of this method.  The data will be                 
              analyzed using new statistical techniques addressing the multi-                
              level nature of these data and a truncated, categorical set of                 
              response measures.
