Abstract    :
                   The internal cellular anatomy of wood has a fossil record                 
              extending back to the origin of the flowering plants, and beyond.              
              Dr. Elisabeth Wheeler is a leading expert on the fossil record of              
              wood anatomy, and she has been instrumental in assembling an                   
              international effort to construct a database of wood                           
              characteristics.  Dr. Wheeler has requested a Career Advancement               
              Award to allow her to gain the statistical and computing skills                
              necessary to begin critical exploration of this data resource.                 
              Patterns of evolutionary and functional relationships will be                  
              established through this analysis, thereby clarifying the factors              
              behind the diversity of wood structures found alive today.                     
                   Dr. Wheeler is uniquely qualified to lead both the expansion              
              and the analysis of the proposed database of wood anatomy.  The                
              proposed career advancement activities will provide her with a                 
              realistic opportunity of expand and accelerate this research                   
              program.
