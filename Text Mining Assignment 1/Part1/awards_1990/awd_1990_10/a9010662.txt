Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal is to conduct theoretical studies on two physical                
              oceanographic topics:  salt fingers, and ocean circulation.                    
              Salt fingers occur in the ocean due to the differing magnitudes                
              of salt and heat diffusion.  They have been observed                           
              frequently, and this study will address models of the physics.                 
              In addition, models of the ocean circulation, particularly                     
              western boundary currents will be investigated.  Current models                
              attempt to account for non-linear and inertial effects, but                    
              have difficulty obtaining consistent results.  This study will                 
              address layered models of the circulation.
