Abstract    :
              The proposed research experimentally investigates exclusion, an                
              important condition determining the distribution of power in                   
              exchange networks.  Predictive studies for theory testing and                  
              exploratory studies for theory extension are proposed.  STudies                
              examine predicted distributions of power, measured by rates of                 
              exchange, and predicted rates of power development, measured by                
              changes in exchange rates over time.  Exploratory studies form a               
              foundation for the extension of the GPI analysis of Markovsky, et              
              al. (1988) to a new class of exclusionary networks.  These                     
              studies are intended to systematically remove scope conditions                 
              which have restricted application outside the laboratory.  These               
              studies also initiate examination of the structural dynamics of                
              exchange networks.  The proposed work is facilitated by ExNet, an              
              electronic network now on line at the USC Laboratory for
