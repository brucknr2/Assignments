Abstract    :
              We propose an experimental investigation on the                                
              fabrication and characterization of nanometer-scale                            
              structures exhibiting quantum interference effects in                          
              gallium arsenide semiconductor materials with                                  
              applications to novel quantum effect devices.  The                             
              primary objective of the proposed research is to                               
              demonstrate transistor action by quantum modulation                            
              in nanostructures.                                                             
                                                                                             
              Specifically, we propose to fabricate and characterize                         
              a three terminal, T-shaped device called the Quantum                           
              Modulated Transistor (QMT) as a vehicle to                                     
              investigate the feasibility of realizing transistor action                     
              based on confinement-induced quantum effects.  The                             
              quasi-one-dimensional electron channel for the QMT                             
              will be fabricated using electron beam lithography                             
              and chemically assisted ion beam etching techniques                            
              in A1GaAs/GaAs modulation-doped field effect                                   
              transistor (MODFET) heterostructures.  Molecular-                              
              beam-epitaxy grown planar-doped, single and double                             
              heterostructure MODFET materials exhibiting                                    
              enhanced mobility and electron sheet density will be                           
              used.  The QMT will be exhaustively characterized                              
              through current-voltage measurements at various                                
              temperatures down to 1 K.  A successful realization                            
              of high confinement nanostructures and the QMT                                 
              should lead to the observation of novel quantum                                
              effects and provide a new class of ultra-small devices                         
              for performing complex electronic functions.
