Abstract    :
                   This grant provides partial support for an investigation                  
              of of bound state beta decay, a phenomenon never before                        
              observed in the laboratory.  Through the use of very sensitive                 
              resonance fluorescence detection methods, the formation of the                 
              23S1 state of the 3He atom resulting directly from the beta                    
              decay of tritium will be measured.  The direct formation of                    
              bound states following beta decay is expected to be of                         
              importance in nucleosynthesis.  This experiment will utilize a                 
              lanthanide hexa-aluminate laser which is tunable around 1.08                   
              micrometers.
