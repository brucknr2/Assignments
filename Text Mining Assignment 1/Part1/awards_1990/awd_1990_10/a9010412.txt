Abstract    :
              Automatic garbage collection enhances programmer productivity by               
              eliminating many of the low-level concerns associated with explicit            
              reclamation of dynamic objects, by protecting programmers from having          
              to deal with subtle bugs that result from dangling pointer problems, and       
              by allowing programmers to select simple algorithms that might otherwise       
              be rejected because of the perceived complexity of managing the dynamic        
              creation and destruction of many short-lived objects.  The research            
              pursued in this project focuses on:                                            
                                                                                             
              - generalization of an existing real-time garbage collection algorithm         
              to deal effectively with arbitrarily long strings of characters and with       
              arbitrarily long arrays of pointers to other objects.  Overlapping             
              substrings and array slices would also be supported.                           
                                                                                             
              - design and prototype implementation of a CPU-independent memory module       
              that executes the generalized real-time garbage collection algorithm in        
              parallel hardware while application programs run on the host CPU.              
                                                                                             
              - analytical and empirical evaluation of software and hardware                 
              prototypes to determine worst-case and average performance of particular       
              memory management operations.                                                  
                                                                                             
              - development of general techniques to help programmers analyze their          
              real-time programs in order to p?lace upper bounds on the programs'            
              memory requirement and on the times required to perform particular             
              memory operations.
