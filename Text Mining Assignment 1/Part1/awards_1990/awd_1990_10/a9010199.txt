Abstract    :
              This ROW initiation proposal is to investigate how economic                    
              factors, family structure, and labor market structure shape the                
              employment and wage profiles of employed older Americans.  This                
              research will provide information important to older adult                     
              economic well-being and has implications for the potential                     
              shortage of skilled labor during the early years of the 21st                   
              century.  Specific aims of the research are:                                   
                                                                                             
              1)   To identify sources of change in the age composition of                   
                   occupations in the total labor force and sources of                       
                   change in the gender and labor supply composition of                      
                   occupations in the labor force aged 55 and over;                          
                                                                                             
              2)   To identify determinants of wages and labor supply in                     
                   the older labor force as additive and interactive                         
                   functions of individual characteristics, receipt of                       
                   non-wage income, family structure, and trends in the                      
                   industrial structure of the labor market;                                 
                                                                                             
              3)   To determine whether change in the industrial structure                   
                   offsets effects of non-wage income on the labor supply                    
                   from older employed adults;                                               
                                                                                             
              4)   To identify how family structure conditions labor                         
                   market outcomes among older employed adults;                              
                                                                                             
              5)   To evaluate the differential effects of change in                         
                   industrial structure on employment profiles of youth                      
                   and older adults.                                                         
                                                                                             
              Census data and Current population Survey data for 1960, 1970,                 
              1980, and 1989 will be analyzed.  Shift share analysis and least               
              squares regression methods will be used.
