Abstract    :
              This proposal is designed to develop a mitochondrial antibiotic                
              resistance marker in soybeans. Soybean cell cultures will be                   
              initiated and mutaginized. After mutagenesis they will be                      
              selected with the antibiotic, oligomycin. Oligomycin resistance                
              is due to a change in mitochondrial ATPase. Oligomycin resistant               
              cultures will be checked to see if the mutation to resistance is               
              stable by relaxing selection. Stable mutant cultures will be                   
              grown into plants. It is important to have a selectable marker in              
              mitochondria so that mitochondrial transformation methods and                  
              studies can be developed.
