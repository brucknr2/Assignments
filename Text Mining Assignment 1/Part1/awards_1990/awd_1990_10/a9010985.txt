Abstract    :
              The existence of a universal neural network, AMNIAC, developed by the          
              principal investigators for theoretical reasons, raises the                    
              possibility of implementing a general purpose neurocomputer, i.e., one         
              which may be "programmed" to behave like any other neural network.             
              Such general purpose neurocomputers will run different neural networks         
              on the same hardware like our serial computers run programs today.  A          
              general purpose neurocomputer should include capabilities beyond those         
              of a universal neural network.  Most important among these are                 
              efficient massive storage, rapid retrieval, learning, and                      
              sophisticated input/output.                                                    
                                                                                             
              The goal of this project is to simulate AMNIAC on a massively parallel         
              computer.  This simulation will allow the design of adequate massive           
              storage, learning and input/output capabilities.  It will also allow           
              benchmarks to provide reliable estimates of the feasibility and                
              efficiency of an actual general purpose neurocomputer.
