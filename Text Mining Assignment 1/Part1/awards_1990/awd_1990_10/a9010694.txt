Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a one-year collaborative research project sponsored                    
              by the AIT-CCNAA Cooperative Science Program between Dr.                       
              Donald Reed, University of California at Santa Cruz and                        
              Professor Liu Char-Shine, National Taiwan University.  This                    
              project is part of a large international effort to understand                  
              arc-continent collision and plans to conduct marine                            
              geographical studies on the Taiwan collision Zone.  The                        
              offshore region of Taiwan is one of the best areas in the                      
              world to study the incipient processes of arc-continent                        
              collision.  The work proposed here can lead to major                           
              improvements in our understanding of the structural and                        
              sedimentological evolution of arc-continent collision zone.                    
              This project is jointly supported by the NSF and the Taiwan                    
              National Science Council. 9046553                                              
              Kerlin                                                                         
              The National Science Foundation sees the direct involvement                    
              of undergraduates in science and engineering research as an                    
              important management tool for encouraging young people to                      
              pursue careers in research and development.  This supplemental                 
              support for "Research Experiences for Undergraduates" at the                   
              University of Tennessee will involve two students in an                        
              ongoing U.S.-Hungary cooperative research project in nuclear                   
              engineering.
