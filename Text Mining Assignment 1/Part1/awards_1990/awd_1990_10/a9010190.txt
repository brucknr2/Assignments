Abstract    :
              This project was submitted under the program for Research                      
              Opportunities for Women.  The research is to collect data and to               
              work out techniques on macroalgae in Arctic tundra streams in order            
              to establish strong, testable hypotheses for future research.  This            
              work will be coordinated with the nutrient enrichment experiments              
              of Long Term Ecological Research Program at Toolik Lake.  The four             
              objectives address macroalgal distribution and hydrochemistry                  
              through three adjacent tundra drainage basins, the productivity of             
              dominant macroalgae species in the nutrient-enriched gradient of               
              the Kuparuk River, the effect of grazers on the occurrence of                  
              macroalgae, and the search for macroalgal species as indicators of             
              environmental change.  The study will establish some baseline data             
              on macroalgal communities in fertilized and pristine Arctic                    
              ecosystems.
