Abstract    :
              This research is on developing a new fault tolerant design method,             
              based on the self-checking checker designs.  The focus is on                   
              combinational and sequential circuits based on self-check concepts             
              and exploitation of self-checking systems for testability.  A                  
              design methodology based on theoretical results for the design of              
              self-checking circuits is being investigated.  Efficient codes,                
              which can be used to encode the outputs of functional circuits such            
              that the overhead is low, are being used in the research.  The work            
              is oriented primarily to CMOS technology.
