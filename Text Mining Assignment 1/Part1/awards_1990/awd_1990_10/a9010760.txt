Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This research is designed to determine if the amygdala, a                 
              brain structure located deep wihtin the cerebral hemisphere,                   
              contributes to the establishment of an increased state of arousal              
              (i.e. non-specific attention), particularly during the presence                
              of meaningful environmental stimuli.  The effects of                           
              manipulations of the amygdala on these measures of arousal will                
              be assessed, as will the effects of such manipulations on                      
              learning and on the processing of sensory information.  The                    
              results should yield new and important information concerning the              
              brain circuits which enhance the processing of sensory                         
              information and which contribute to the most optimal conditions                
              for learning.
