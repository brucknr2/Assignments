Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Although invertebrates comprise more than 95% of all animal                    
              species, there has been little study of their learning.  To                    
              remedy this deficiency, Dr. Bitterman has been investigating how               
              honey bees learn.  The honey bee is a highly-evolved                           
              invertebrate, with sensory, motor, and motivational properties                 
              that are unusually well suited to the purpose.  The experiments                
              are done primarily with foragers coming of their own accord from               
              nearby hives to laboratory window sills, where they work for                   
              concentrated sugar solution, a reward they strongly prefer to the              
              nectar of flowers in the field.                                                
                                                                                             
              The experiments show a wide range of similarities in the way in                
              which honey bees and vertebrates store and use information                     
              acquired in the course of their experience, similarities that are              
              surprising in view of the remoteness of common ancestry and the                
              vast differences in brain size and structure as well as in                     
              ecology.  As the project continues, some of the critical                       
              similarities are being probed more deeply to examine the                       
              possibility that they may be only superficial, and the scope of                
              the comparison is being extended in a variety of new experiments.              
              The hypothesis suggested by the data already in hand is that the               
              evolution of intelligence has been governed by adaptive                        
              constraints much broader than usually conceived, and in good                   
              measure perhaps even by a logic of its own.
