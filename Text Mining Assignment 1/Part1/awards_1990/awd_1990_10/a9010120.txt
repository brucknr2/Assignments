Abstract    :
              Object-oriented databases intend to support non-traditional                    
              database application areas such as artificial intelligence (AI),               
              computer-aided design (CAD), and office information systems                    
              (OIS). An important requirement of non-traditional database                    
              applications is the support of application evolution which                     
              includes evolution of schemas as well as objects. The overall                  
              goal of this research is to understand properties of dynamically               
              evolving objects and their schemas and find mechanisms for                     
              supporting them in object-oriented databases.                                  
                                                                                             
              One goal of this research is to implement an extensive schema                  
              manager having many useful capabilities for dynamic schema                     
              management, such as schema evolution, graphics schema editor,                  
              schema versioning, DAG rearrangement views, and logical database               
              schema design. Also, in this research, two more issues which are               
              closely related with dynamic schema management will be                         
              investigated: (1) storage model issue (i.e., ways of storing                   
              dynamic object instances), (2) the issue of how to achieve code                
              (i.e., method) compatibility in the face of dynamic schema                     
              changes.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              This research contributes toward: (1) identifying data structures              
              and operations which are necessary to support dynamic schemas and              
              objects, (2) analyzing basic properties of storage models, and                 
              (3) investigating techniques for method conversion which can cope              
              with dynamic schema changes, in object-oriented databases.
