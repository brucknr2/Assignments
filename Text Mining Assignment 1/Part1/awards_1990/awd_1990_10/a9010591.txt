Abstract    :
              The purpose of this project is to collect and analyze enterprise               
              level data-sets in Bulgaria.  The data sets will be collected in               
              collaboration with a team of Bulgarian scientists.  One data set               
              will be used to analyze the effect of different forms of                       
              ownership structure on productivity, labor demand, and investment              
              decisions.  In particular, divers hypotheses will be tested on                 
              the broad area of the economic effects of alternative                          
              organizational structures, especially provisions for worker                    
              participation in decision-making and in ownership.  The second                 
              data set is on the entry of new firms and will be used to analyze              
              the formation and entry of new enterprises.  This research is                  
              important because a detailed analysis of the transition processes              
              in Bulgaria will not only provide useful information to                        
              facilitate reform in that country, but it will also have broader               
              applicability to the reform efforts in other Eastern European                  
              countries.
