Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Dr. McMillan will study the behavior of stellar dynamical systems              
              using new computational techniques and capabilities.  In particular            
              he will perform numerical studies of two separate, but closely                 
              related, problems involving the dynamics of self-gravitating                   
              systems.  The first entails the extension of existing integration              
              techniques into qualitatively new domains, via the incorporation               
              of new force evaluation methods into established integration codes.            
              The second involves a detailed investigation of the celebrated                 
              three-body problem, concentrating on the structure of its parameter            
              space for scattering encounters, and on the stability of so called             
              hierarchical triples.  The results of this work will be: (i) the               
              development of a new stellar dynamical integration code that will              
              permit a qualitatively new degree of realism to be introduced into             
              star cluster simulations; (ii) a significant improvement in our                
              understanding of the microphysical processes that drive the                    
              evolution, and determine the appearance of star clusters; and (iii)            
              important new additions to the arsenal of numerical techniques that            
              will enable us to fully utilize the capabilities of the next                   
              generation of super and parallel computers.  Of particular interest            
              is the application of a new massively parallel computer in star                
              cluster simulations and comparison of its suitability for these                
              computations with that of more traditional supercomputers.
