Abstract    :
              This four day workshop on mobile subsea robots will be                         
              concerned primarily with complete working systems or                           
              subsystems and will emphasize experimental results.                            
              Participation will be by invitation only on the basis of                       
              extended abstracts or complete papers.  Participants will                      
              be selected by an international Program Committee composed                     
              of leading experts in the field.  A maximum of twenty-five                     
              papers will be selected for presentation and inclusion in                      
              the workshop proceedings.                                                      
                                                                                             
              The total number of participants, including observers,                         
              will be limited to forty.  Any person active in the field                      
              may request in writing an invitation to participate as an                      
              observer.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              Topics to be addressed in the workshop include: (l)                            
              sensors and sensor integration, (2) perception and                             
              environmental modelling, (3) mission planning and mission                      
              execution, (4) locomotion, maneuvering, and manipulation,                      
              (5) actuators, propulsion, and structures, (6) system                          
              architecture and standards.
