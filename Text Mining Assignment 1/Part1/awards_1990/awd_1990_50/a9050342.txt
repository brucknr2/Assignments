Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Project MERIT is a three year effort to enhance middle                         
              school teachers' knowledge of mathematics in content and                       
              pedagogy. The project targets teams of teachers consisting                     
              of two to four underprepared teachers and a master/mentor                      
              teacher. Teams will participate in a four week-summer                          
              institute, substantial academic year followup, and a second                    
              summer institute. A first cohort of teachers will begin in                     
              the summer of 1991, and a second cohort in the summer of                       
              1992. The program will include mathematics content,                            
              instructional strategies, and leadership training. MERIT is                    
              a cooperative effort of CSU-Dominquez Hills, the Los Angeles                   
              Unified school district, and The Achievement Council.                          
                                                                                             
              Cost sharing is provided by CSU-Dominguez Hills, the Los                       
              Angeles Unified School District, the Achievement Council,                      
              and participating schools, as 20% of the NSF award.
