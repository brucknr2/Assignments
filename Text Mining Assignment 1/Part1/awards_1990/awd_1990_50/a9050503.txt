Abstract    :
              This proposal supports a project designed to improve the                       
              demonstration and laboratory course of the Introduction to                     
              Photonics course at a community college located near military and              
              industrial areas.  It is designed for technicians, and not for                 
              future scholars.  The proposer states "the project is significant              
              in that it is a model program of curricular design which can aid               
              the military and industry by supplying personnel who can design and            
              operate equipment in the emerging fields of photonics."  I concur              
              with his statement.
