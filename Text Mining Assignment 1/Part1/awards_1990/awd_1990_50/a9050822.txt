Abstract    :
              The electrical engineering curriculum at UMR is experiencing a                 
              major restructuring that requires additional control system                    
              laboratory experiments.  For undergraduate EE students                         
              specializing in control, we need to provide a well-rounded                     
              education in the theory and practice of control system design in               
              the areas of:                                                                  
                                                                                             
              1.   Workstation-based integrated control system design                        
              2.   Manufacturing automation                                                  
              3.   Process control                                                           
                                                                                             
              In addition, we need to provide manufacturing automation courses               
              for non-EE students and for EE students not specializing in                    
              control.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              The current laboratory equipment is woefully inadequate to meet                
              these goals.  The equipment requested in this proposal represents              
              the first step toward meeting these goals.  The equipment                      
              laboratory experiments supported by this equipment are scaled-                 
              down versions of the types of problems our graduates encounter in              
              industry.  The innovative features of this proposal are:                       
                                                                                             
              1.   Introduction of Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE) concepts to              
                   undergraduate control student.                                            
              2.   Introduction of manufacturing automation in the                           
                   undergraduate curriculum.                                                 
              3.   Use of commercial process control equipment and a scale                   
                   process plant teach control.
