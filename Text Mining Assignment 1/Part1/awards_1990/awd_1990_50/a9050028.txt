Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              California State University, Long Beach, will carry out a                      
              project to improve methods courses in elementary science by                    
              conducting summer workshops for college and university                         
              instructors who teach the elementary science methods course.                   
              The project seeks to improve science education for elementary                  
              school children by strengthening the elementary science                        
              methods courses which enroll large numbers of elementary                       
              preservice teachers each semester.    Exemplary instructors                    
              and science teacher education specialists will conduct these                   
              summer workshops, and the participants will learn about                        
              recent research findings and new science teaching methods                      
              while exchanging ideas and forging new connections with                        
              colleagues.  It is anticipated that these methods instructors                  
              will return to their home institutions to stimulate change in                  
              teacher education and help create links between the science                    
              and education faculties at their institutions.  Systematic                     
              communication and continuing follow-up will take place after                   
              the summer workshops through electronic networking,                            
              newsletters, and annual meetings.  As a result of the follow-                  
              up activities, an array of resource materials for elementary                   
              science methods courses will be developed for dissemination.                   
              A pilot workshop will be conducted during the summer of 1990,                  
              and three additional workshops will take place during the                      
              summer of 1991.  The workshops will be held at various                         
              geographical locations throughout the U.S., and one of the                     
              workshops will take place at an institution that educates                      
              large numbers of minority students.  The total cost sharing                    
              for the project is 24% of NSF's contribution.
