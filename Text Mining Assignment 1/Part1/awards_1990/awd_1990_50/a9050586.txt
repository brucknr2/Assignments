Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The goal of this project is the improvement of the chemistry                   
              program through the utilization of a gas chromatograph-Fourier                 
              Transform Infrared Spectrometer system.  Hyphenated techniques                 
              such as the GC-FTIR are commonly used in graduate school and                   
              industry; the chemistry department is providing an example of                  
              coupled equipment for their students as well as giving them the                
              opportunity for hands on experience.  The faculty have approached              
              the task in a three-phase plan developed a few years back:  the                
              purchase of the FTIR, the subsequent purchase of the GC, followed              
              by the interfacing of the two pieces of equipment.  Although the               
              GC and FTIR are coupled, through the use of computer controlled                
              swing-away mirror, they can be used independently.                             
                                                                                             
              The combined system is allowing the investigation of complex                   
              mixtures that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to                    
              undertake at the undergraduate level.  The GC-FTIR also lends                  
              itself readily to the techniques of the newly-established micro-               
              organic chemistry program.  The courses most directly affected by              
              the acquisition of the GC-FTIR are the two-semester Organic                    
              Chemistry sequence, Advanced Organic Chemistry, Instrumental                   
              Analysis, and Senior Research.                                                 
                                                                                             
              The institution contributed to this project in an amount equal to              
              the NSF funds.
