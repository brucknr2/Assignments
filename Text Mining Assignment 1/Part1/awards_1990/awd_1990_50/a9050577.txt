Abstract    :
              This project provides greatly increased learning opportunities for             
              students in the areas of mechanical, electro-mechanical, and                   
              computer-aided design.  A key aspect of this project is the                    
              acquisition of ten Hewlett-Packard computer workstations with UNIX             
              operating environment, Parametric Technology's Pro-Engineer                    
              application software, and Hewlett-Packard's Printed Circuit Design             
              Software.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              This equipment enables the students to solve real-world design                 
              problems relating to function, part fit, and manufacturing                     
              limitations that, because of time limitations, require three                   
              dimensional methods.  Students receive a greater understanding of              
              design principles through direct visualization of both the problem             
              and its possible solutions.  The added capability of this new                  
              software/hardware allows the student to spend more time in critical            
              and analytical thinking, and less time documenting and drawing the             
              design.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              The award is being matched with a greater amount (130 percent) by              
              the principal investigator's institution.
