Abstract    :
              The "field to Finish" surveying equipment acquired in this project             
              completes the integrated system needed to teach engineering                    
              students state-of-the-art data collection, processing, computing,              
              design and plotting practices that they will encounter in                      
              professional employment.  Through the planned curricula changes the            
              concepts of automation in data collection, computer-aided design               
              and drafting are introduced into civil and surveying engineering.              
              Modern engineering practice requires that graduates have knowledge             
              of modern data collection and design techniques.  The project goal             
              is to produce professional engineers and land surveyors with                   
              "hands-on" experience.  The award is being matched by an equal                 
              amount from the principal investigator's institution.
