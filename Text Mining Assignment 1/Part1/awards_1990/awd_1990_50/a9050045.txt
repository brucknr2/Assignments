Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The purpose of this project is to develop a Center for Reform                  
              in Science Education based on the NSTA model for Scope,                        
              Sequence, and Coordination, and to implement the model in grades               
              6-8  in seven schools spanning six counties in North Carolina.                 
              Anticipated outcomes of this project, which focuses on the                     
              spacing of science instruction and the teaching of ideas                       
              from concrete to abstract, will include higher student                         
              performance on standardized science tests, improvement of                      
              student and teacher attitudes toward science, and greater parent               
              involvement in the science program.  The University of North                   
              Carolina at Wilmington and East Carolina University , in                       
              cooperation with six Centers of the North Carolina Mathematics                 
              and Science Education Network, will work with lead teachers,                   
              university scientists, and science educators to pilot test                     
              the revised middle school science curriculum. Cost sharing in                  
              the amount of $215,143 is 15% of the NSF contribution.
