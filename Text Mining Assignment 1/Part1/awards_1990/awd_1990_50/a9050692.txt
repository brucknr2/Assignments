Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to provide junior-level engineering                
              students with "hands-on" experience in modern instrumentation.  A              
              personal computer is used to gather and reduce data and to present the         
              results in testing the mechanical properties of materials.  The                
              equipment purchased is used as instrumentation for an older tensile            
              testing machine and includes strain gage and LVDT/RVDT input-output            
              modules, central processing module, electronic extensometer and                
              troptometer with rotary position sensor, data logging and control              
              computer software, personal computer, printer, and plotter.                    
                                                                                             
              The award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal               
              investigator's institution.
