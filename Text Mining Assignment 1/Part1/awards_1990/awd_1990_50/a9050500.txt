Abstract    :
              Galveston College is improving its freshman/sophomore biology                  
              laboratories. They are  providing students with modern biological              
              equipment that will allow them to perform experiments which require            
              gathering, analyzing and graphing of data. The equipment allows the            
              faculty to improve introductory biology courses, resulting in increased        
              understanding of biological principles by all students, plus a greater         
              retention of students in science careers. One component of the new             
              equipment is computers which provide for rapid and accurate data               
              collection and enhanced data analysis. Microcomputers make it possible         
              for student to perform simulation experiments of genetic, ecological,          
              and physiological principles that would otherwise be impossible. The           
              college is contributing an amount equal to the award.
