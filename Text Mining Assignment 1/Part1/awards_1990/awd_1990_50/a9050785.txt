Abstract    :
              A Fourier transform infrared spectrometer and an ultraviolet-visible           
              spectrophotometer is used in a series of interdisciplinary laboratory          
              experiments involving undergraduate science and non-science majors             
              in an on-going study of atmospheric terpenes, ozone, and ethylene in           
              the forested areas of the Blue Ridge Mountains surrounding Mount               
              Saint Mary's College.  The liberal arts education of the students is           
              enhanced as they learn more about the environment indigenous to the            
              college through the implementation of this approach to instruction.            
              The grantee provides funds for this project that are more than an              
              equal match for the NSF award.
