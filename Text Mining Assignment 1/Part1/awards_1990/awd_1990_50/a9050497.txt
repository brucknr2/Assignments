Abstract    :
              This project increases the engineering ceramics component of the               
              undergraduate curriculum and permits the offering of an "Area of               
              Specialization" in Engineering Ceramics for undergraduates.  The               
              project goal is to integrate ceramics into the entire curriculum,              
              especially seven undergraduate courses.  The equipment purchased               
              represents those additional items necessary for this undertaking and           
              includes a pycnometer, a particle size analyzer, and a volumetric              
              sorption analyzer for BET surface area and porosity measurements.              
                                                                                             
              The award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal               
              investigator's institution.
