Abstract    :
                   As the concepts of manufacturability and reliability,                     
              and the associated data acquisition systems become                             
              increasingly necessary to the analog design process in                         
              industry, it becomes correspondingly important to incorporate                  
              these concepts, as well as the equipment, into the                             
              undergraduate curriculum.  Under this project equipment is to                  
              be acquired which will enable the emerging concepts of                         
              tolerance analysis and statistical design of circuits and                      
              systems to  be added to the analog design portion of the                       
              undergraduate electrical (EE)  and computer (CpE) engineering                  
              curricula.  This technology is often labeled "Designing for                    
              Manufacturability," and refers to yield, reliability, and                      
              performance of circuits and systems.  These curricular topics                  
              will be taught to all EE and CpE majors through                                
              laboratory experiments in the sophomore and junior years.                      
                   This project is significant because it focuses on the                     
              early introduction of the basic concepts of design for                         
              manufacturability at the undergraduate level in analog design
