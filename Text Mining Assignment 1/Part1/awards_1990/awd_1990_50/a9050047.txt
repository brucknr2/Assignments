Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The overall goal of this project is to link educators, professional            
              science and mathematics association leaders, curriculum developers, and        
              professional scientists and mathematicians to explore ways to improve          
              the teaching of science and mathematics through the integration of the         
              two disciplines.  To initiate the network, a conference is to be               
              conducted by the School Science and Mathematics Association which will         
              bring together the key players to establish communications links,              
              promote multidisciplinary dialogue, encourage and facilitate ongoing           
              research and development, stimulate new activities, and disseminate            
              information and materials.  Post conference networking activities will         
              include the establishment of an electronic network using existing              
              facilities such as Bitnet and Compuserve, a newsletter, and several            
              workshops to provide additional face-to-face networking opportunities.         
              Cost sharing in the amount of $14,472 is 14% of the amount requested           
              from NSF.
