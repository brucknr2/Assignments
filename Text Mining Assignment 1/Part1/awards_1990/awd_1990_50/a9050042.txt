Abstract    :
              A symposium will be convened at the National Technological Literacy            
              Conference in February 1990.  Participants will be the major                   
              practitioners and innovators in science and engineering education for          
              non-science majors, who will review and share their work.  The                 
              symposium is aimed at, and should be of great use to , faculty and             
              administrators from the many liberal arts colleges who will soon be            
              launching attepmts to improve science and technology education for the         
              majority of their students who will not go on to become scientists and         
              engineers. Products will consist of a survey report, to be widely              
              disseminated, and a collection of documents publicized and made                
              available through Penn State University.
