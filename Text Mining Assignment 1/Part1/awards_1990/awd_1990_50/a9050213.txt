Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  We propose to develop curriculum materials for both                       
              students and teachers aimed at helping students integrate                      
              concepts into problem solving in the domain of classical                       
              mechanics.  The materials will supplement traditional                          
              instruction by providing homework and in-class exercises that                  
              would allow students to actively engage in problem solving                     
              activities that highlight concept-based problem solving, and                   
              by providing teachers with instructional strategies to                         
              reinforce the approach.  The materials will be designed in                     
              collaboration with high school physics teachers and will be                    
              based on a rich body of cognitive research.  The proposed                      
              work is an attempt to complement students' proclivity to                       
              rely almost exclusively on formulaic approaches to problem                     
              solving by encouraging conceptual approaches.
