Abstract    :
              This project developments a "curriculum model" for the integration of          
              mechanical design and manufacturing.  The design process begins by             
              converting a concept into a database using Computer Aided Drafting             
              (CADD).  The project equipment is used in the study of computerized            
              manufacturing systems and utilizes the CADD geometry files as the basis        
              1)for Computer Aided Design (CAD), especially analysis with finite             
              element analysis, and 2)for Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM)                 
              including the creation and execution of Computer Numerical Control             
              (CNC) part programs.  Learning progresses from topics courses in               
              mechanical design and manufacturing to a "capstone" semester-long group        
              design project integrating the design and the manufacture of a product.        
              The equipment support for this undertaking includes six (6) CAD/CAM            
              workstations with appropriate peripherals and software; and two (2)            
              manufacturing workcells consisting of a CNC milling machine, a CNC             
              lathe, an educational robot, a vision system, bar code system,                 
              manufacturing system components and a Statistical Process Control              
              System.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              The award is being matched with a greater amount (102%) by the                 
              principal investigator's institution.
