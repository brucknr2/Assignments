Abstract    :
              To meet the increasing demand for trained scientists in the field of           
              biotechnology, this institution has developed a program in                     
              biotechnology, in order to give students both the technical skills and         
              a clear understanding of the principles of the field. Through two              
              laboratory courses, the students utilize advanced DNA cloning and              
              protein isolation and purification techniques to follow a gene from its        
              DNA sequence to its gene product and function. The purchase of culture         
              growth shakers and equipment for electrophoresis of nucleic acids and          
              proteins provides the necessary equipment for these lab courses, which         
              will make the students more competitive for jobs in all facets of              
              biotechnology. The university will contribute an amount equal to the           
              award.
