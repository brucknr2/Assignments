Abstract    :
              The Chemistry Department at the institution upgraded the Polymer               
              Chemistry Laboratory Course with new experiments and modern                    
              state-of-the-art scientific instrumentation through the acquisition            
              of a Perkin-Elmer TGA-7 Thermogravimetric Analyzer.  The                       
              Thermogravimetric Analyzer has extended current characterization               
              and physical property methods to include studies of:  1) Static                
              methods associated with weight change-Isobaric and Isothermal, and             
              2) Dynamic methods associated with weight change-Thermogravimetric             
              and Derivative Thermogravimetric.  The department also acquired a              
              Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform (DRIFT) Accessory               
              and a Horizontal Attenuated Total Reflectance (ATR) Accessory for              
              the Nicolet 510 FT-IR which was a prior acquisition.  These two                
              accessories greatly expanded the capability of the Nicolet 510                 
              FT-IR in infrared analyses of polymer samples.  These upgradings               
              of the department's major holdings enabled it to enhance                       
              significantly the preparation of their students for the challenging            
              world of work in the highly technologically advanced twenty-first              
              century.  The institution contributed to the project in an amount              
              equal to the NSF funds.
