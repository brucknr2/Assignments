Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The Computer Equity Expert Project, which builds on a                     
              completed NSF-funded pilot project, is designed to train 200                   
              computer, science, and mathematics education specialists                       
              throughout the U.S. to become trainers of teachers.  The focus                 
              of the training is on techniques to overcome gender biases in                  
              the teaching and use of computers in science and mathematics                   
              at the middle school/junior high school level and to attract                   
              more girls into fields which utilize computers.                                
                   Teacher Trainer participants will attend a five-and-a-                    
              half-day seminar on either the East Coast or the West Coast                    
              followed by field experience training teachers in their home                   
              states.  The trainers will also attend a two-day follow up                     
              session which will be held between four and six months after                   
              the initial seminar.  Networking activities will be planned                    
              at the seminars and will be a major ingredient of the follow                   
              up sessions.  The network which is formed will be utilized to                  
              continue the training of teachers after NSF funding expires.                   
              Cost sharing for this project in the amount of $90,000 is 9.8%                 
              of the NSF contribution.
