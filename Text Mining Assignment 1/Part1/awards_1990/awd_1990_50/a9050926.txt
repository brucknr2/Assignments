Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Through this project, the institution acquired a Fourier                       
              Transform Infrared (FAIR) Spectrometer which markedly improved                 
              the instructional program in Chemistry at the college.  The                    
              improvements included:  (1) doubling the number of experiments                 
              using infrared spectroscopy in the curriculum.  The new level of               
              exposure to infrared spectral interpretation has been ideal for                
              the training of students in this key technique.  (2) For the                   
              first time, students have been able to learn and use the                       
              important concepts of signal averaging and Fourier transform                   
              spectroscopy.  (3) The purchase of diffuse reflectance sampling                
              accessory for the FAIR allowed easy and rapid study of solid                   
              samples with infrared spectroscopy.  (4) The excitement of modern              
              scientific instrumentation has been transmitted to introductory                
              level students, both majors and non-majors.  These efforts have                
              built on the department's successful incorporation of advanced                 
              instruments in first year courses, and have extended to courses                
              which had no usage of modern instrumentation.                                  
                                                                                             
              The curricular improvements include all branches of chemistry,                 
              and have benefitted students ranging from precollege level to                  
              senior chemistry majors doing independent research projects.                   
                                                                                             
              The institution has contributed to this project in an amount                   
              equal to the NSF funds.
