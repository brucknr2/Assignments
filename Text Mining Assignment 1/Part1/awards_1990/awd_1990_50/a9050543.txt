Abstract    :
              The aim of this project is to enhance the laboratory experience of             
              undergraduate Electrical Engineering students in the area of Digital           
              Signal Processing (DSP).  This is accomplished through the                     
              acquisition of six laboratory workstations and the establishment of            
              a Digital Signal Processing Laboratory.  Each station consists of a            
              second generation TMS320 Signal Processor based algorithm development          
              system, an Analog Interface Board (AIB), a Spectrum Analyzer and a             
              Personal Computer.  The DSP course and the Senior Design Project               
              course are the primary targets of this laboratory enhancement.                 
              Students are able to develop and implement a wide variety of projects          
              in the area of Digital Filtering, Spectrum Analysis, Speech                    
              Processing and Digital Control Systems.  This project offers the               
              students hands-on experience and a more comprehensive understanding            
              of the concepts than can be obtained through lecture alone.  The               
              award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal                   
              investigator's institution.
