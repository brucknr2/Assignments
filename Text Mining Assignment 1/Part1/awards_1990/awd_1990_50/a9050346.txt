Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Monterey Bay Aquarium's educational programs model hands-on,               
              process-based science teaching, which is called "Wet Science".  The            
              Wet Science Project is designed to improve the scientific literacy of          
              7th to 12th grade teachers, strengthen their science-teaching skills,          
              and develop support systems for hands-on science in their districts.           
              This project will train 120 teachers from 13 school districts.  With           
              each participant conducting one in-service for ten colleagues, a total         
              of 1200 teachers and their students will be reached.  The project              
              duration is 36 months, and the cost sharing is 33 percent of the               
              amount requested for the National Science Foundation.                          
                                                                                             
              The project consists of five levels of teacher enhancement.  The               
              participants will learn science and wet-science teaching, study                
              upper-division marine ecology, conduct field research, develop                 
              curriculum, and learn student research management, science education           
              promotion, multi-disciplinary team building, and adult teaching skills.        
              The participants will form teams to transform their wet-science                
              experiences into classroom of field-trip experiences for students and          
              colleagues.  Together with their school administrators, the                    
              participants will integrate wet science into district goals, curriculum        
              and programs, and disseminate wet science to other school districts,           
              aquariums, and zoos.
