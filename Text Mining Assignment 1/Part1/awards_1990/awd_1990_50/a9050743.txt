Abstract    :
              This project involves the use of Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) to                
              acquire and analyze high-quality digital spectra and images                    
              obtained with existing spectrographs and telescopes.  Student                  
              project work using these upgraded instruments are done in both the             
              optics laboratory and the observatory.                                         
                                                                                             
              Two scientific-grade CCD detector systems, the Star I/Series 300               
              system, from Photometrics Ltd. of Tucson, Arizona are used.  These             
              systems have been added to existing moderate-and high-resolution               
              spectrographs and to a 56-cm telescope.                                        
                                                                                             
              This upgrade in detector capability provides students with the                 
              experience of (1) working with state-of-the-art instruments of the             
              type now commonly found in many optics laboratories and                        
              observatories, and (2) carrying out quantitative analysis of the               
              data obtained with these instruments using sophisticated image                 
              processing software.                                                           
                                                                                             
              The outcome of this program is a greatly enhanced lab experience               
              for students in physics and astronomy.  The college is matching the            
              award in with an equal amount of funds.
