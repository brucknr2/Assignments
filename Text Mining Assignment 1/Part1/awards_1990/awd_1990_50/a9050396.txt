Abstract    :
                   This project will support establishment of a computer                     
              laboratory in which students use powerful software for                         
              interactive computational investigations and numerical                         
              experiments.  It is being funded under the Instrumentation and                 
              Laboratory Improvement (ILI) Program, which has the goal of                    
              supporting projects to develop new or improved instrument-based                
              undergraduate laboratory courses in science, mathematics, or                   
              engineering.  The Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement                   
              Program provides matching support for the instrumentation                      
              necessary to implement undergraduate instructional improvements                
              at U.S. colleges and universities.                                             
                   In particular, the main objective of this project is to                   
              bridge the gap between where the students currently are and where              
              the faculty are in their own professional use of computer                      
              hardware and software.  This will be done by restructuring the                 
              applied mathematics and numerical analysis sequences so as to                  
              include a computer laboratory that is based on student projects                
              using MATLAB for interactive numerical investigations.
