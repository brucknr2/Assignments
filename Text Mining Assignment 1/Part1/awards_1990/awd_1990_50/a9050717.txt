Abstract    :
              A method suitable for the measurement of heat release rates of                 
              both large-and small-scale fires has evolved during the past                   
              decade.  This method, known as oxygen consumption calorimetry,                 
              has advantages over traditional calorimetric methods, which rely               
              on the measurement of sensible energy, a difficult task in open                
              systems.  Oxygen consumption calorimetry requires only that                    
              products of combustion be collected and their composition and                  
              flow rate measured.  This is a significantly easier task, but it               
              does require sophisticated gas analysis equipment.                             
                                                                                             
              The instrumentation requested here will permit the completion of               
              a small-scale oxygen consumption calorimeter.  This calorimeter,               
              modeled after the Cone Calorimeter developed at the Center for                 
              Fire Research of the National Institute of Standards and                       
              Technology, will permit undergraduate students to perform a wide               
              range of state-of-the-art fire measurement experiments for both                
              laboratory assignments and independent research project.  It will              
              be possible to demonstrate the factors influencing the dynamics                
              of fires within structures and the quantitative methods to                     
              measure and characterize these factors.
