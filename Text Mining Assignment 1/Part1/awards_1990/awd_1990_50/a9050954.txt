Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to the Biology Department at The American            
              University to purchase equipment for a new laboratory course                   
              entitled "Techniques of Evolutionary Research".  Methods for                   
              studying evolutionary mechanisms and reconstructing evolutionary               
              history have diversified.  Understanding of the genetic structure              
              of species has been deepened by the adaption of molecular biology              
              techniques and quantitative analysis.  Equipment purchased through             
              this award will be used to train students in these current methods.            
              Students will learn up-to-date methods for the study of:  (1)                  
              molecular evolution (2) quantitative genetics and (3) phylogenetic             
              reconstruction.  Laboratory exercises in molecular evolution will              
              use a frost-free freezer, a chromatography refrigerator, a mini-               
              fermentor, 2 pH meters, 2 top-loading balances, and an ice machine.            
              Quantitative genetic analysis will use an electrobalance and an                
              image analysis system.  A PS/2 computer is will be purchased for               
              operating programs for phylogenetic reconstruction.  All equipment             
              will be secondarily available to other courses, so approximately               
              1000 students will profit from this equipment acquisition over a               
              5-year period.  The aim of "Techniques of Evolutionary Research"               
              is to insight interest in evolution and to develop skills useful               
              in careers in organismic biology, but useful in all other areas of             
              biological research as well.
