Abstract    :
              Students are using an Advanced Computer Laboratory, equipped with              
              networked SUN SPARC workstations and Mac IIci computers, in their              
              advanced mathematics courses.  All mathematics majors are required to          
              encounter contemporary mathematical computing tools for symbolic,              
              graphical, statistical, and numerical purposes.
