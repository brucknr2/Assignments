Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This materials development project, the Science of Alcoholism Curriculum       
              for American Indians (SACAI), is designed to fill a gap in current             
              curricula by developing an innovative alcohol education component for          
              science classrooms in largely Native American schools.                         
                                                                                             
              SACAI proposes to address the need for improved instruction and science        
              based information about alcohol, teaching the science of alcoholism in         
              fourth through ninth grade science programs.                                   
                                                                                             
              SACAI will integrate the latest research findings about the role played        
              by genetics, biochemistry, and the interaction of these with                   
              environmental factors with traditional and culturally relevant                 
              approaches utilizing science-based experiments, statistical research and       
              instruction which develops critical thinking.                                  
                                                                                             
              SACAI is premised upon three important unique principles: 1) the               
              importance of using a science base for American Indian students in             
              alcohol education, 2) the necessity of including traditional cultural          
              elements and culturally relevant materials and approaches in this              
              alcohol education, and 3) the importance of integrating these                  
              ineffective education efforts.
