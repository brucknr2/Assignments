Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This ILI project provides for the upgrade of existing Advanced                 
              Undergraduate laboratory experiments which include light                       
              scattering and neutron scattering.  In addition, it will allow                 
              for new experiments to be developed in nuclear magnetic                        
              resonance, electron spin resonance, and semiconductor physics.                 
              These experiments will introduce advanced undergraduate students               
              to valuable techniques that are currently applied to materials in              
              experimental laboratories in both universities and industry.
