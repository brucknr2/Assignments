Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The Association of Science-Technology Centers, in                         
              partnership with the Franklin Institute Science Museum,                        
              requests $360,523 from the National Science Foundation in                      
              support of a major hands-on traveling exhibition about global                  
              climate change.  The 3,500-square-foot exhibition will provide                 
              a broad public with accurate, balanced scientific information                  
              about global warming and insight into its economic and social                  
              context.  In so doing, it will help to spark interest in                       
              science and mathematics among the many young museum visitors                   
              who are concerned about the future of our environment.                         
                                                                                             
                   Approximately 2,000,000 citizens will visit the exhibition                
              during its two-year tour of 11 U.S. science museums.  Workshops                
              conducted at each site before the exhibition arrives and                       
              educational materials to supplement program planning will                      
              assist host museums in broadening the exhibition's impact.                     
                                                                                             
                   ASTC and the Franklin Institute have a history of highly                  
              successful collaborative traveling exhibition projects.  We                    
              will be assisted by a group of eminent advisors, a leading                     
              developer of hands-on science exhibits, and the Museum's                       
              experienced team of exhibit evaluators.  The exhibition may                    
              serve as a model for other museums that are now developing                     
              permanent exhibitions about environmental issues and other                     
              topic issues in science.
