Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to the Biology Department at Texas                   
              A & M University for upgrading instrumentation for an existing                 
              course, Principles of Microscopy.  This is an innovative course,               
              covering developments in light microscopy and digitized image                  
              analysis, and emphasizing image recording.  The course will help               
              prepare advanced undergraduate students for careers which use                  
              modern optics and image analysis.  Instruments to be purchased                 
              include video and 35 mm cameras, computers and software for image              
              analysis, and accessories for upgrading existing microscopes.  The             
              improvements will also benefit students in other upper division                
              courses, senior honors students executing special projects and will            
              improve instruction in freshman honors biology.  The developments              
              will enhance the research skills of undergraduates, thereby                    
              encouraging them to pursue graduate education.  The grantee is                 
              matching this award with non-Federal sources.
