                                             Abstract                                        
                                                                                            
              Creative Enterprises will develop a project to motivate                        
              minority students to prepare for careers in science and                        
              mathematics-based professions, especially engineering.                         
                                                                                             
              The technical approach is to create interactive media, both                    
              a computer program and text based materials, to stimulate                      
              and inform the students concerning the activities of                           
              professional engineers, academic and social life in college,                   
              course requirements for both High School and College, etc.                     
              The combined media will use an "adventure" format with many                    
              possible scenarios dependent upon the student's selection,                     
              plus humor, and special effects (e.g. computer sound and                       
              animation) to sustain interest.  Examples will relate the                      
              secondary school course content with the engineer's                            
              practices.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              The program will be conducted in conjunction with the                          
              California State University, Long Beach MESA (minority                         
              outreach) and MEP (Minority Engineering Programs), and in                      
              conjunction with Compton Middle schools (grades 6-8).  A                       
              computer simulation with text accompaniments and teacher's                     
              guides will be completed and field tested in the junior high                   
              schools.  The success of this model will lead to a range of                    
              materials for economical, nationwide dissemination and                         
              application on many educational levels for minorities,                         
              women, disabled, and other special and general populations.
