Abstract    :
              This project acquaints electronics engineering technology                      
              students with the theory and application of Digital Signal                     
              Processing (DSP) using a hands-on approach.  The student                       
              experience is novel in that the developed course centers around                
              carefully chosen practical DSP systems.  This provides motivation              
              and direction to students over the duration of the course.  A set              
              of experiments are focused on a practical system and lead the                  
              students to conclude a course project in one semester.                         
                                                                                             
              The equipment acquired includes PC based instrumentation with a                
              DSP engine.  Project work is accomplished using a commercial                   
              processor.  With powerful software and interface hardware,                     
              students are able to design and test systems on the workstation.               
                                                                                             
              The award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal               
              investigator's institution.
