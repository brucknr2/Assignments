Abstract    :
              Recent developments in geological sciences and the growing job                 
              market in hydrogeology and geological engineering have demanded                
              better training in geophysical instrumentation at the undergraduate            
              level. Two geology courses, Field Geology and Geophysics are being             
              improved by the addition of geophysical field equipment, in                    
              particular a gravity meter and a proton magnetometer as well as a              
              portable PC. Geophysical projects are being developed for a field              
              camp, and about 1/3 of the lectures in Geophysics are being                    
              replaced by a field laboratory program, which provides students                
              with hands-on experience with geophysical instruments and enhances             
              their knowledge of geophysical methods. Other courses that benefit             
              from the equipment are plate tectonics, geological engineering,                
              structural geology, and independent projects. The university will              
              contribute an amount equal to the award.
