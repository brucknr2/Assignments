Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A stopped-flow (SF) rapid mixing accessary is being used to                    
              introduce undergraduate chemistry, biochemistry and molecular                  
              biology students to an important method for studying fast                      
              reactions.  The SF accessory is primarily used with a UV/Visible               
              absorption spectrometer (UV/VIS), computerized and modified for                
              rapid data collection.  Reactions with half-lives on the order of              
              20-50 milliseconds are studied with the system.  Many biological               
              enzyme-catalyzed reactions are studied with the SF/UV/VIS system.              
              The SF/UV/VIS instrument is used by junior majors in a combined                
              analytical, inorganic and physical chemistry laboratory.  Senior               
              thesis research students use the SF/UV/VIS instrument to study                 
              the oxygenation of cobalt-substituted hemocyanin,  The hands-on                
              experience with a technique used to study rapid reaction has                   
              enhanced the students' understanding of concepts of biochemical                
              and chemical kinetics.                                                         
                                                                                             
              The institution has contributed to this project in an amount                   
              equal to the NSF funds.
