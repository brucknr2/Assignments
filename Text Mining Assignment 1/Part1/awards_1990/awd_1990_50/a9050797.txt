Abstract    :
              Students are doing computer-based mathematical experiments in a                
              classroom/laboratory equipped with Macintosh SE computers running              
              Mathematica.  A new calculus curriculum is being implemented in which          
              students are more actively involved in the learning process by                 
              interacting with the computer, the instructor, and with each other.            
                                                                                             
              The institution will contribute an amount equal to the award.
