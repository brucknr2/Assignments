Abstract    :
              The aim of this project is to acquaint the engineering student                 
              with modern methods used in the acquisition of experimental data               
              and in the automatic control of experimental events or industrial              
              processes.  The specific goals are: to introduce modern data                   
              acquisition techniques in a undergraduate fluid mechanics and                  
              heat transfer laboratories and to facilitate real-time computer                
              analysis of experimental data.                                                 
                                                                                             
              To accomplish these goals, the following instrumentation is being              
              sought: an Automatic Data Acquisition System (ADAS), various                   
              sensors and transducers to interface with the ADAS, a printer and              
              plotter for outputing the data, and equipment to construct a                   
              pressure transducer calibration system.                                        
                                                                                             
              The project is important for the following reasons: by                         
              streamlining the analysis of experimental data, the exposition of              
              the fundamental physical principles of fluid flow and heat                     
              transfer will be enhanced for engineering students, opportunities              
              for creative undergraduate student projects/research with                      
              subsonic and supersonic windtunnels will be broadened and the                  
              engineering student will be trained in the use of the ADAS by                  
              generating computer software for analyzing and presenting                      
              experimental data acquired in various fluid flow phenomena.
