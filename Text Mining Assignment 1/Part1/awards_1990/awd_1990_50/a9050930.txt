Abstract    :
              This proposal addresses the problem of Applied Optics and Light                
              Instrumentation for the Graphic Arts student.  The program is                  
              directed toward a non-science and Publication audience.  It is                 
              proposed to set up experiments using equipment from the graphics               
              industry rather than the "traditional" introductory physics                    
              experiment in lights.  This is a program which should contribute               
              to an increase in scientific literacy.
