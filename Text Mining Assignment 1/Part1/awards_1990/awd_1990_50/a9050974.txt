Abstract    :
              The geology department is integrating field geophysics into the field          
              component of lower and upper division courses with emphasis on the use         
              of geophysical data as a tool for problem solving. A gravity meter,            
              magnetometer and portable computer are being acquired to meet four             
              goals: 1. exposure of all geology majors and a majority of physics             
              majors to geophysical field techniques, 2. enhancement of undergraduate        
              research opportunities, 3. year-round use of the equipment, and 4.             
              limited use by non-majors in demonstration settings and exhibits. The          
              equipment is being used in a new lower division course in Field Methods        
              as an exercise in quantitative data acquisition, contouring and                
              mapping. It is used in the Structural Geology course to study offsets          
              in the Balcones fault zone or to model a salt dome. Use in the                 
              Geophysics course emphasizes processing and modelling methods. Students        
              participate in planning of surveys and prepare a comprehensive report          
              on the analysis techniques and results. It is also used for several            
              surveys on the yearly Majors Field Trip, as a demonstration tool in the        
              Oceanography course, and in an exhibit monitoring Earth tides. The             
              university will contribute an amount equal to the award.
