Abstract    :
                   This project will support the establishment of a computing                
              laboratory for undergraduate majors in mathematics and computer                
              science in conjunction with courses in combinatorics and applied               
              logic.  It is being funded under the Instrumentation and                       
              Laboratory Improvement (ILI) Program, which has the goal of                    
              supporting projects to develop new or improved instrument-based                
              undergraduate laboratory courses in science, mathematics, or                   
              engineering.  The Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement                   
              Program provides matching support for the instrumentation                      
              necessary to implement undergraduate instructional improvements                
              at U.S. colleges and universities.                                             
                   In particular, the main objectives of this project are to 1)              
              provide a computing environment which supports the fast, large-                
              scale computations of the type regularly encountered in numerical              
              analysis and which allows the use of symbolic algebra and                      
              functional language packages; and 2) to acquaint students with                 
              the tools and methods used regularly by professionals in the                   
              world of real research and applications.
