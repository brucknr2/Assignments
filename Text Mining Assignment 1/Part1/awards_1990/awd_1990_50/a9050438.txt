Abstract    :
              The physics department is introducing a course, Mathematical and               
              Computational Methods for Scientists and in addition is incorporating          
              advanced symbolic computation, numerical analysis, and simulation in           
              other physics courses.  Using the symbolic package Mathematica and             
              Macintosh IIci computers connected to an existing network, students            
              are able to explore physical situations which are otherwise too                
              complex.  The project is producing courseware using Mathematica which          
              will be useful to other physics departments as well.                           
              The college is matching the award with an equal amount of funds.
