Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer/data system (GC/MS) has                  
              been acquired for use in the undergraduate chemistry laboratories              
              at Whitman College.  In the introductory organic chemistry                     
              laboratory, it is being used to separate and identify organic                  
              compounds in complex mixtures such as gasoline.  In the advanced               
              organic chemistry laboratory, several ultra-microscale                         
              experiments using GC/MS detection and analysis of the products                 
              have been introduced.  In Instrumental Analysis, the instrument                
              is used to demonstrate the principles and limitations of GC/MS,                
              and detect and identify trace organic pollutants in water                      
              samples.  In the Biochemistry laboratory, students detect and                  
              identify therapeutic drugs and drugs of abuse in body fluids and               
              determine the damage that carcinogens and chemotherapeutic dugs                
              inflict on DNA.  In the newly established Forensic Laboratory,                 
              GC/MS is being used to detect and identify illegal drugs, gunshot              
              residue, arson evidence, and explosives.  The project staff plan               
              to publish the results of the above experiments.                               
                                                                                             
              The institution has contributed to the project in an amount equal              
              to the NSF funds.
