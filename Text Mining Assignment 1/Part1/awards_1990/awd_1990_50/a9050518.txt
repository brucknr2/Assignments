Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Modern laboratory investigations in petrography, the study                
              of the mineralogy and textures of rocks, go far beyond                         
              traditional methods of transmitted light microscopy.  We are                   
              requesting an optical microscopy system to bring new equipment                 
              and techniques into our undergraduate curriculum.  The equipment               
              includes a polarizing microscope with both transmitted and                     
              reflected light systems to display all three types of images.                  
              Cathode luminescence is sensitive to specific trace elements  in               
              minerals;  it highlights subtle textures produced by sequential                
              crystal growth that are not visible in transmitted light, and                  
              permits rapid identification of certain minerals.  Reflected                   
              light allows identification of opaque minerals and study of their              
              intergrowths.  With the video system we can dramatically increase              
              efficiency and clarity in instruction of petrographic methods:                 
              we will all be looking at the same feature at the same time.  The              
              alternative is painstaking interaction with each student, taking               
              turns viewing an image in the scope.  The students will use the                
              instruments in a series of new classroom exercises and in                      
              undergraduate research.  The video display also allows                         
              instructive demonstrations in introductory classes to show the                 
              importance of synthesizing several types of information.
