Abstract    :
              This project enhances undergraduate student skills in the related              
              areas of application design/development and data management.  A                
              computer system upgrade creates a relational distributed database              
              management system (dbms) capability between two independent nodes              
              running a mix of operating systems and network protocols.  The areas of        
              dbms performance and tuning can be studied in both the node-specific           
              and distributed cases.  The configuration builds an existing                   
              instructional base to a point where it meets students needs.  The              
              project is especially important at a time when dbms technology is a top        
              priority in product development.  It also addresses the increasingly           
              recognized connection between dbms and expert systems.                         
                                                                                             
              The award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal               
              investigator`s institution.
