Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Western Illinois University will conduct a four-year program                   
              to create a nationwide network to support teachers in                          
              implementing the NCTM Standards in geometry.  The project                      
              will enhance leadership skills of teams for strengthening                      
              teaching practices; examine, document, and refine effective                    
              approaches and materials; enhance teacher knowledge of                         
              geometry; and develop sensitivity to equity issues.  The                       
              activities will include five regional one-week seminars,                       
              inservice work at local units, and presentations at                            
              professional meetings.  In all, 300 teachers of grades K- 12                   
              will participate, and over 4,000 teachers will benefit from                    
              the subsequent inservice efforts.  This project was                            
              initiated by the Board of Directors of NCTM and will benefit                   
              from its support of the activities.  Western Illinois                          
              University and the National Council of Teachers of                             
              Mathematics have contributed an amount equal to 24% of the                     
              National Science Foundation request. ***//
