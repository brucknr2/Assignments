Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to the Section of Ecology and Systematics            
              at Cornell University to purchase equipment for two introductory               
              courses which were introduced to infuse the excitement and                     
              experimental approach of modern organismal biology into the                    
              curriculum.  The courses will enroll 100 to 120 students per year,             
              and approximately one-third of the Biological Sciences majors at               
              Cornell and half of the Natural Resources majors will take one or              
              both of the courses.  Laboratories will be hands-on exercises for              
              the students.  Functional Ecology (BioSci 272) integrates                      
              information about the ecology, physiology, and behavior of                     
              vertebrates in a phylogenetic context.  Weekly laboratories                    
              alternate surveys of the vertebrates with experiments that                     
              illustrate characteristic physiological features of those taxa.                
              The twice-weekly laboratories in Functional and Comparative                    
              Morphology (BioSci 274) combine dissection of preserved material               
              with electromyography, motion analysis, and morphometries in an                
              hypothesis-testing approach to morphology.  Funds will be used to              
              purchase laboratory instruments (for osmometry, telemetry, oxygen              
              analysis, and electromyography), video equipment (for motion                   
              analysis and morphometry), a treadmill and air-flow visualizer (for            
              studies of locomotion), and microcomputers (for data collection and            
              analysis).  The equipment will be shared by the new courses and                
              used in an advanced organismal biology courses and for                         
              undergraduate projects.  The grantee is matching this award with               
              non-Federal sources.
