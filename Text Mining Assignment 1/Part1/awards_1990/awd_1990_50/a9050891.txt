Abstract    :
              The Sociology Department is equipping a microcomputer laboratory that          
              allows entry-level students to be introduced to quantitative analysis          
              of sociological data. The equipment makes possible hands-on experience         
              in analyzing existing survey data from the National Opinion Research           
              Center (Illinois) and the Survey Research Center (Michigan), and allows        
              students to do statistical analyses of data from their own research            
              projects. The instrumentation expands the laboratory from eight                
              computers, available for majors only, to a larger facility that allows         
              all students to be exposed to : 1. in-class demonstrations of data             
              manipulation and analysis; 2. assignments based on the anlaysis of             
              survey data, and 3. assigned laboratory periods where students work            
              under direct faculty supervision. The college will contribute an amount        
              equal to the award.
