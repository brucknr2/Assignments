Abstract    :
              The objective of this proposal is to construct a multi-purpose                 
              facility which allows instructions in computerized measurement                 
              techniques through fundamental experiments in fluid mechanics.                 
              The facility is a water channel whose design allows for the study              
              of external flows such as the flow around bluff bodies and                     
              familiar airplane shapes.  The design also allows study of                     
              internal flows such as diffusers and nozzles through the                       
              insertion of false walls.  Two measurement systems will be                     
              initially used on the channel: hotfilm anemometry and laser                    
              doppler anemometry.  Both of these systems will incorporate                    
              computer-controlled data acquisition and reduction.  The selected              
              computer system uses symbolic programming in a language which is               
              both powerful in application and simple to learn.  This                        
              facilitates simple modification of both the acquisition and                    
              reduction modules by the students so that they may design their                
              own experiments and easily adapt the classroom experiments.
