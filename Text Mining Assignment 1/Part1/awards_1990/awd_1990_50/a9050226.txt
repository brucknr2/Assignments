Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Based upon the Teaching Integrated Mathematics and Science (TIMS)              
              teacher enhancement materials,l complete K-6 and science materials will        
              be developed. Students will spend about half their time doing hands-on         
              quantitative experiments and activities, a fourth of their time involved       
              in open ended problem solving, and a fourth of their time learning             
              methods of arithmetic.                                                         
                                                                                             
              The classroom materials produced by the project will include a total of        
              140 hands-on experiments which combine knowledge of significant science        
              and mathematics (each of which takes about five class periods to               
              complete), problem solving modules, a textbook, and an adventure book.         
              Students will pursue problems in small groups, discover relationships          
              through experiments, and discuss their results.  They will gather,             
              graph, and analyze data.  They will, through sequences of questions            
              about the experiments, make conjectures, find alternative methods,             
              discuss connections, verify conclusions, and reinforce skills.                 
                                                                                             
              Support for the curriculum will include extensive teacher materials in         
              addition to a teacher preparation textbook, an inservice/staff                 
              development program,l an assessment package, and a program for parent          
              involvement.  The curriculum will make extensive use of appropriate            
              technologies including calculators and computers.  Teachers' pedagogical       
              skill and knowledge should increase through use of these materials.            
              Evaluation of the project encompasses both formative evaluation during         
              the pilot test phase and summative evaluation during the field test            
              phase.  As part of the summative evaluation, the children's growth in          
              conceptual development, the children's attitudes, and the teachers'            
              attitudes and knowledge will all be studied and compared with other            
              curricula.
