Abstract    :
              The Biology Department at Adelphi has introduced a new curriculum              
              for biology majors. To provide students with the requisite tools               
              to meet the demands of the next century, they are redesigning the              
              Vertebrate Physiology laboratory and are introducing computers for             
              real time monitoring of physiological experiments. The new                     
              equipment is being used in newly designed experiments, including               
              hormonal and neurotransmitter control of muscle contraction,                   
              responses of different muscle types, and chemical control of nerve             
              conduction. The project introduces computers in a laboratory                   
              environment closely approximating their use in a clinical or                   
              industrial setting. It allows for increased data analysis and                  
              manipulation which will improve students' quantitative skills, and             
              is a major component of the plan to integrate computers in the                 
              undergraduate curriculum. The university will contribute an amount             
              equal to the award.
