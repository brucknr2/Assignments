Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The theory and practice of mass spectrometry is an important                   
              component in the training of modern chemists about the atomic and              
              molecular structure of organic and inorganic substances.  The                  
              acquisition of a gas chromatographic/mass spectrometric/data                   
              system allowed the chemistry department to improve its curriculum              
              in the theory and practice of mass spectrometry and, at the same               
              time, gave young, undergraduate student scientists hands-on                    
              experience with one of the most powerful analytical methods for                
              the rapid separation of complex mixtures encountered in the real               
              world.  Experiments using the system have been designed for and                
              are used in Honors General Chemistry, Analytical Methods, Organic              
              and Advanced Organic Chemistry, and the Research and Honors                    
              Research programs.                                                             
                                                                                             
              The institution contributed to this project in an amount equal to              
              the NSF funds.
