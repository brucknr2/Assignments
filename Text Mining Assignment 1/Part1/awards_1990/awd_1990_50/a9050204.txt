Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is designed to develop, test, and prepare for dissemination       
              curricular materials to encourage active and comprehensive student             
              learning in geography in grades 6-12.  These materials will build on the       
              structure used for the videotapes on "Global Geography", produced and          
              disseminated by the Agency for Instructional Technology.  That structure       
              is based on major geographic themes and concepts that are keyed to             
              important global issues.  The project will engage nationally-known             
              geographers, educators, and outstanding classroom teachers in a major          
              program to develop materials that are inquiry-based, issue-oriented, and       
              based on specific data.  They will build critical thinking skills and          
              address attitudes and values.  They will reinforce the widely adopted          
              "five fundamental themes" in geography and will encourage and facilitate       
              learning a variety of geographic skills.  The project will test the            
              materials locally in Colorado classrooms and nationally through the            
              network of state-based geographic alliances supported by the National          
              Geographic Society.  The materials will be relevant for use throughout         
              the U.S. and in a variety of community settings.
