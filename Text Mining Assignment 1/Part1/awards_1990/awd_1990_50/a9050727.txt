Abstract    :
              The incorporation of a state-of-the-art high speed refrigerated                
              centrifuge and preparative ultracentrifuge are improving the                   
              laboratory part of the curriculum by allowing students to perform              
              experimental protocols in, for example, subcellular fractionation,             
              plasmid isolation, and protein and DNA separations. This should                
              facilitate the understanding of fundamental principles of modern               
              molecular biology. The equipment should also foster a greater diversity        
              in student research projects, by making available the instrumentation          
              necessary for performing macromolecular level separations. The college         
              will contribute an amount equal to the award.
