Abstract    :
              The aim of this proposal is to improve the quality of the                      
              laboratory courses involved in the Composites and Polymers                     
              Program at New Mexico State University.  This multi-disciplinary               
              program involves the chemistry, mechanical engineering, chemical               
              engineering and engineering technology and is focused on the                   
              manufacture, processing, testing and design of fiber-reinforced                
              polymeric composites.  The improvement will be accomplished by                 
              incorporating modern instrumentation and equipment for three                   
              laboratory courses:  Polymers and Composites Laboratory: Advanced              
              Materials Technology Laboratory and the Composites Team Project                
              Laboratory.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              Curriculum and course content developments are being accomplished              
              with the aid of funding provided by industrial co-sponsors.  The               
              laboratory courses are strongly correlated to current industrial               
              problems.  A key feature of the program is an emphasis of the                  
              multi-disciplinary nature of and team approach to composite                    
              materials manufactured.  These improvements will have a large                  
              impact on the students passing through the program, and can                    
              provide a model for other multi-disciplinary polymer and                       
              composite materials laboratory programs.
