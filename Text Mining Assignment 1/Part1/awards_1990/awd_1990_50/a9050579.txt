Abstract    :
              The department is enhancing areas of developmental, cell and molecular         
              biology through the purchase of a fluorescence microscope. A major             
              application of the microscope is localization of proteins within cells         
              using fluorescently labeled antibodies. This will enhance the learning         
              of concepts of differential gene expression. The immunofluorescent             
              localization of proteins in embryos, using specific antibodies,                
              demonstrates the temporal and spatial specificities of gene expression.        
              A second concept, of specificity of subcellular localization of                
              proteins within cells, can also be demonstrated, since the fluorescence        
              microscope allows the localization of different proteins in specific           
              sites within the cell in a dramatic and visual way. The university will        
              contribute an amount equal to the award.
