Abstract    :
              Architectural Engineering and Architecture students are presently              
              taught introductory, intermediate and advanced courses in analysis             
              and design of structures without any experimental type of activity.            
              Students have great difficulty in visualizing and thoroughly                   
              understanding fundamentals of structural element/system                        
              performance.  In the case of Architecture students, a special                  
              effort has to be made to overcome aversion to the subject.  Lack               
              of experimental activities also deprives students of the knowledge             
              on how to interface high-technology devices and structural                     
              analysis/theory.                                                               
                                                                                             
              The Department of Architectural Engineering at The Pennsylvania                
              State University is committed to revise the approach to the                    
              teaching of structural courses to both its students and                        
              Architecture majors by complementing traditional class-room                    
              teaching with experimental and computer modelling laboratory                   
              activities.  The acquisition of the equipment in this project will             
              allow the implementation of a Structures Demonstration and Teaching            
              Laboratory (SDT Lab).  The laboratory will feature experimental                
              testing, data acquisition and simulation systems to conduct planned            
              tests as well as students will improve both their creativity and               
              synthetic thinking.  Initially, three courses will be affected by              
              the implementation of the laboratory in addition to individual                 
              students working on their senior project.
