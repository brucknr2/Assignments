Abstract    :
              Sophisticated instruments are being introduced into the undergraduate          
              petrography lab. The instruments consist of a cathodoluminescence unit         
              and the TV digitizer which will be combined with existing resources to         
              create an innovative and comprehensive curriculum. The goal is to              
              integrate cathodoluminescence microscopy, scanning electron microscopy,        
              reflected light microscopy, and image analysis techniques in a manner          
              that provides hands-on experience with the instruments, including              
              analytical capability and computer-interfacing, and a deeper knowledge         
              of petrography and petrologic processes. This program gives students           
              the experience to enter good graduate programs and to be more                  
              competitive in the job market. The university will contribute an amount        
              equal to the award.
