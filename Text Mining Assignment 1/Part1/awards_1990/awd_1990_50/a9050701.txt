Abstract    :
              The Electron Microscopy course is being upgraded to include                    
              preparation techniques for biological specimen imaging through the             
              purchase of a critical point dryer, sputter coater, and stereoscopic           
              zoom microscope. Students in cell and molecular biology can benefit            
              from an expanded opprtunity to study surface topology. Students in             
              general biology and botany receive a closely supervised first hand             
              experience on the SEM, including the taking of scanning electron               
              micrographs, which will serve as the lab material for the study of             
              intricate structure. The project upgrades graduate school preparation          
              and employment possibilities for graduating students since scanning            
              electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy are skills            
              that are highly sought after in industry. The college will contribute          
              an amount equal to the award.
