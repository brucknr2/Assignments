Abstract    :
              In a department that has, over the past five years, modernized and             
              enhanced its biology curriculum and introduced much new equipment, the         
              introduction of flow cytometry can further enhance the students'               
              education. A new benchtop flow cytometer is being introduced in the            
              non-majors biology course, the introductory sequence for majors, and in        
              six upper division laboratory courses, as well as student research             
              projects. Thus, many students can benefit from this new and rapidly            
              expanding technology, which will greatly enhance their preparation for         
              graduate school, medical school, or industry. This sophisticated               
              instrument can serve as a focal element in a curriculum designed to            
              offer introductory through advanced students a progression of                  
              vertically-integrated, hands-on experiences with modern biological             
              tools. The college will contribute an amount equal to the award.
