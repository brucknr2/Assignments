Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This three-year project targets elementary school teachers (grades             
              3-6) in the greater Boston area.  The project's intent is to                   
              enhance teachers' understanding of central and pervasive                       
              mathematics concepts, and the processes by which mathematics is                
              learned.  The mathematics topics to be addressed are measurement,              
              number systems, number relation ships, estimation, patterns and                
              functions, and geometry.  The project will emphasize the                       
              assessment of mathematical ideas, and the use of activity-based                
              instruction.  Two cohorts of teachers will be involved in summer               
              work shops and sustained academic year activities.  Leadership                 
              training will be provided in the third summer, and the teacher                 
              leaders  will be involved in in-service work sponsored by the                  
              Massachusetts State Department of Education.  Cost sharing is                  
              provided by the Massachusetts State Department of Education, the               
              Education Collaborative for Greater Boston, and the participating              
              schools as 19% of the NSF award.
