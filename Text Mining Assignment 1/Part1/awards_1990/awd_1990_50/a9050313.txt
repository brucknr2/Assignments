Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Cornell Institute for Biology Teachers in Organismal                       
              Biology will be a three-week summer Institute for 60 upstate                   
              New York high school teachers over three years.  The                           
              Institute will consist of three main parts:  1) A three                        
              credit-hour course in organismal biology, including lectures,                  
              lab work and work designed to train teachers in field                          
              techniques; the areas covered will include behavior, ecology,                  
              physiology, and environmental biology.  Concepts from                          
              evolutionary biology will be used to integrate the separate                    
              elements.  Methods to teach evolution will be covered in                       
              detail.  2) Lectures and field trips designed to introduce                     
              other subjects and more Cornell faculty and resources to the                   
              participants.  3) A set of laboratory exercises designed to                    
              be taken back to the participants classrooms.                                  
                                                                                             
              Goals of the program include increasing teacher knowledge of                   
              organismal biology, dissemination of new teaching materials                    
              to enhance biology laboratory teaching, and development of a                   
              teacher network and a Cornell extension system for continuing                  
              activities.  Novel aspects include the use of computers for                    
              teaching and communication, increased use of Cornell as                        
              resource, and the cooperative development of new teaching                      
              laboratories with the participants.                                            
                                                                                             
              An amount equivalent to 40% of the NSF award is being                          
              contributed as cost-sharing.
