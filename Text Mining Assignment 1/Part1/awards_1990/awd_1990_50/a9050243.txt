Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  First Light is a one-hour documentary to be shown                         
              nationally on WGBH-TV's NOVA science series.  It tells the                     
              extraordinary story behind the building of the Hale Telescope                  
              on Palomar Mountain in southern California.  The film also                     
              documents a research effort at the frontiers of astronomy that                 
              has pushed the Hale beyond anything its builders had imagined:                 
              The attempt to find and map the edge of the known universe.  It                
              follows astronomers Maarten Schmidt, James Gunn and                            
              Don Schneider as they search for distant quasars.  This team                   
              recently detected a quasar that is by far the most distant                     
              object yet found in the universe; its discovery may challenge                  
              our current understanding of cosmic evolution.  The documentary                
              is based on the award winning book First Light: The Search for                 
              the Edge of the Universe by Richard Preston.  After broadcast,                 
              the program will have wide educational distribution in                         
              secondary schools and colleges.
