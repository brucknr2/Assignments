Abstract    :
              Students are benefiting from a laboratory equipped with microcomputers         
              running the computer algebra system Derive in their preparation for            
              careers in high technology environments.  "Real world" problems of a           
              complexity not approachable by students before are being analyzed by           
              graphical, numerical, and symbolic techniques.                                 
                                                                                             
              The institution will contribute an amount equal to the award.
