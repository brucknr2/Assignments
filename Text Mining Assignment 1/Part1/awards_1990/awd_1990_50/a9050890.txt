Abstract    :
              This project will equip a laboratory in Modern Optics for physics              
              and/or engineering majors. Specifically, the laboratory will permit            
              experimental work in the area of tuneable lasers and fiber optics.             
              These students will be given the opportunity to develop a working              
              knowledge of two very important areas in modern optics of                      
              particular interest to those pursuing jobs in experimental research            
              and industrial work.
