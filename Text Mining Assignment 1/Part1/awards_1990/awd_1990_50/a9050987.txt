Abstract    :
              The laboratory provides high-speed processing and high-resolution              
              graphics for involving undergraduate students in an interdisciplinary          
              area of current interest -- Chaos.  This furnishes the undergraduate           
              students with an opportunity for interdisciplinary work as well as             
              experience with a contemporary research topic.  The laboratory uses            
              technologically advanced workstations to achieve both the speed and            
              the resolution desired.  The grantee provides funds for this project           
              that are an equal match for the NSF award.//
