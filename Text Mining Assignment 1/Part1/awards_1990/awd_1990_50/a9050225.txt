Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The St. Louis Science Center plans to design and develop a                
              2400-square-foot permanent exhibit dealing with the fields of                  
              cellular and molecular biology, including biotechnology and                    
              genetic engineering.  The primary goal of the exhibit is to                    
              affect the attitudes of millions of visitors, with the                         
              secondary goal being to serve as a model for other science                     
              museums and science centers.
