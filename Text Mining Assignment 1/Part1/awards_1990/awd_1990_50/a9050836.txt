Abstract    :
              This project is creating a laboratory environment where non-                   
              science students can actively and independently collect, graph and             
              analyze data over a wide range of physical systems.  The goal is               
              to instill the excitement and intrinsic interest that should be                
              present in the laboratory study of physics even at the most basic              
              level, while at the same time to make the introductory laboratory              
              experience more accurately reflect the nature of science in the                
              modern world.  The laboratory design must be flexible enough to                
              accomodate students with limited mathematical skills and no                    
              laboratory experience while allowing for completion of the                     
              experiments with the allotted lab period.  These aims are being                
              achieved by equipping the introductory laboratory with computers               
              in sufficient numbers that there is one for each group of two                  
              students.  The computers are being used, with appropriate                      
              interfaces and sensors, to simplify data taking and analysis as                
              well as greatly expanding the number and type of physical phenomena            
              that may be studied by non-science majors.  The data logging and               
              rapid data analysis of the computers allow the students to use most            
              of the lab period to think about what they are measuring and to try            
              variations of the experiment.  The rapid and varied graphical                  
              presentation of data allows for a high level of analysis and the               
              introductory laboratory becomes the positive and enlightening                  
              experience that it should be.                                                  
                                                                                             
              The college is matching the award with an equal amount of funds.
