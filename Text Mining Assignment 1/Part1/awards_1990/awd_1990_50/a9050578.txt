Abstract    :
              Tho goal of the project was to strengthen the chemistry program at             
              Russell Sage by acquiring a new nuclear magnetic resonance                     
              spectrometer to replace one that has become obsolete and                       
              unreliable.  The instrument formerly in use, a seventeen year old              
              Varian EM360A, long occupied a role of central importance in the               
              chemistry curriculum, particularly in the area of organic                      
              chemistry.  However, this instrument suffered from serious bouts               
              of instability that have limited its utility.  Moreover, it could              
              not perform special NMR applications.  The acquisition of a new                
              Varian EM360L spectrometer with complete supporting accessories                
              greatly enhanced the chemistry program's capabilities in this area.            
              In addition to providing stable, reliable performance for routine              
              student use, this instrument made possible new and highly desirable            
              applications.  These include spin decoupling techniques to assist              
              in the analysis of complex spectral patterns, variable temperature             
              measurements for use in monitoring reactions, and the opportunity              
              to record fluorine and phosphorus spectra.  The instrument had                 
              major impact on a number of courses, and its special capabilities              
              were particularly valuable in connection with student research                 
              projects.  The University is matching the award with an equal                  
              amount of funds.
