Abstract    :
              This project gives engineering students better insight into                    
              design procedures through early exposure at the freshman level                 
              and again by looking at fresh ideas in design during the senior                
              year.  Freshman engineers design and draw a part on a personal                 
              computer then send the part data through a network to a computer               
              numerically controlled (CNC) machine for fabrication.  This                    
              firmly establishes the relationship between concept, graphic                   
              presentation, and resultant product.  It also serves to heighten               
              excitement among freshman about engineering as a career.                       
                                                                                             
              In addition, senior teams experiment with the various aspects of               
              design including conceptualization, detailing, checking,                       
              analyzing, assembling of details, and CNC machining of parts                   
              through the use of local area networks.  Innovative design                     
              procedures are developed for future use in the industrial work                 
              place.                                                                         
                                                                                             
              The award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal               
              investigator's institution.
