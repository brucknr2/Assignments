Abstract    :
              Polarizing microscopes and thin sectioning equipment are being                 
              incorporated into several geology courses. The instruments will be             
              used to improve instruction in five upper division courses including           
              mineralogy, petrology, economic geology, and optical mineralogy, as            
              well as independent undergraduate research projects. Students can now          
              get "hands-on" experience from sample preparation to their                     
              identification, with the use of thin sectioning equipment. This will           
              be aided by the department's personal computers using mineral                  
              identification software. The university will contribute an amount              
              equal to the award.
