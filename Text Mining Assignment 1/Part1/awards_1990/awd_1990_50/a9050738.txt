Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Through this project, digital computers have been interfaced to                
              four spectrometers in the department of chemistry to enable more               
              students to accomplish more sophisticated studies with the                     
              instruments.  Student learn more thoroughly how the instruments                
              work and write programs that control and record data from the                  
              instruments.  The students in the advanced chemistry courses                   
              designed and built some of the electronic circuits that are used               
              for communication between the computers and the instruments.                   
                                                                                             
              The upgraded instruments allow students to do experiments for                  
              classroom work and research that they could no do without the                  
              computers.  In addition to the use of the computers with the                   
              instruments, they are able to write papers and work with a                     
              chemical data base on the computers.                                           
                                                                                             
              The institution is contributing to the project in an amount equal              
              to the NSF grant.
