Abstract    :
              This project establishes two modern workstations/data acquisition              
              systems to extend student laboratory experiences in electronics,               
              digital systems design, and materials science.  The facility is                
              also used to support senior majors in conducting their group design            
              projects.  The presence of such equipment allows for more extensive            
              design and analysis of various design alternatives.  As such, the              
              equipment enhances the exposure to computer assisted engineering               
              (CAE) systems.  The award is being matched by an equal amount from             
              the principal investigator's institution.
