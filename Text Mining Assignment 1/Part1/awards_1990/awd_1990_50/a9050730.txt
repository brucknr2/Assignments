Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project incorporates two modern spectroscopic instruments                 
              into a novel, four-year, project-based laboratory program.  The                
              instruments include an atomic absorption (AA) spectrometer, used               
              in first- and second-year labs, and a Fourier -transform infrared              
              (FTIR) spectrometer, used in second- and third-year labs.  The                 
              major goal for students in this program, the development of                    
              independence and resourcefulness, is implemented by labs with                  
              integrated content that are separate from lecture courses and                  
              that operate on the basis of individualized, multi-week student                
              projects.  Both the realism and openendedness of such a program                
              necessitate early and intensive use of modern instruments that                 
              are fast and versatile.  The chemistry program at the institution              
              offers a realistice introduction to the investigatory nature of                
              science for the many students taking only one or two years of                  
              chemistry and fosters a smooth transition by majors into                       
              undergraduate research, graduate study, and chemical careers.                  
              Student projects using these instruments range from AA analysis                
              of coordination compounds prepared in first-year labs to                       
              research-level study of hydrogen bonding with FTIR in third-year               
              projects.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              The insitution has contributed to this project in an amount equal              
              to the NSF funds.
