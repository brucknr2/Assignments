Abstract    :
              This project is designed to give undergraduate students an opportunity         
              to use new instrumentation for laboratory experimentation and research         
              projects in cell culturing, hybridoma technology, protein isolation and        
              characterization, and antigen-antibody analysis. The major instruments         
              purchased are laminar flow hoods, an inverted microscope, a CO2                
              incubator, a liquid nitrogen storage tank, a centrifuge, an ELISA              
              reader and software, and gel electrophoresis equipment. These are to be        
              used primarily in a new cell biology course but also in existing               
              courses in invertebrate zoology, embryology, immunology, genetics and a        
              non-majors biology course. Independent study students can also utilize         
              it. The college will contribute an amount equal to the award.
