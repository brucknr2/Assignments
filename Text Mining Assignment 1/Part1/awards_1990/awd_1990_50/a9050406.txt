Abstract    :
              Students in calculus and statistics are benefitting from a new                 
              curriculum that emphasizes the concepts and strategies that the                
              powerful ideas of those disciplines make possible in attacking                 
              problems.  The new courses are supported by a laboratory equipped              
              with Macintosh computers running Mathematica and Minitab.  The                 
              calculus curriculum is being developed within the framework of NSF-            
              funded calculus project at Macalester College.  The institution will           
              contribute an amount equal to the award.
