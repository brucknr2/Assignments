Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The University of Alabama at Birmingham will conduct a two-year program        
              to stimulate school-wide mathematics achievement in grades 4-6 of four         
              school systems within the metropolitan Birmingham area.  The term              
              "school-wide" is used here in a technical sense: the model is based on a       
              school as a "unit of change", the smallest unit necessary to sustain           
              change over the long term, and "school-wide" involvement means that at         
              least 75% of the teachers will participate.  The project features a six-       
              week summer institute on strengthening content knowledge through a             
              problem-solving approach, the nature of children's mathematical                
              thinking, increasing pedagogical skills, and materials development.            
              Throughout the following academic year, the project staff will visit           
              participant classrooms to facilitate implementation.  A leadership             
              training workshop consisting of five days in the second summer and five        
              days during the next academic year will prepare the participants for           
              outreach.  A total of 40 teachers will participate in the six-week             
              institute, and 21 of these teachers will participate in the leadership         
              training.  The University of Alabama at Birmingham and the four local          
              school districts have contributed an amount equal to 19% of the National       
              Science Foundation request.
