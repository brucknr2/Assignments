Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The National Science Teachers Association (NSTA) has designed a                
              plan for a national reform in the scope, sequence, and coordination            
              of secondary school science programs which spreads the teaching of             
              science through all six years of grades 7-12 and which emphasizes              
              the progression in teaching and learning from the concrete to the              
              abstract.  The reform effort, which is already under way on a small            
              scale under Federal funding, is to be tested in a number of                    
              sites(pilot centers) throughout the country.                                   
                                                                                             
              This project is designed to enable NSTA to become the coordination             
              center for the reform effort.  NSTA will coordinate activities of              
              the pilot centers including assessment, evaluation, and                        
              documentation.  In addition, NSTA will be working with six                     
              curriculum committees to design, compile, and disseminate project              
              materials to be used by pilot centers in their curriculum                      
              restructuring efforts.  NSTA will serve as the hub of a network                
              which links the pilot centers through meetings, newsletters, and               
              computer conferencing.
