Abstract    :
              Although computers are a standard, and often essential geologic tool,          
              most geology curricula have failed to incorporate computer education as        
              a part of classical geology. The Fort Lewis College Geology Department         
              is now able to expand and upgrade its existing pilot course in computer        
              applications by developing a computer laboratory which allows all              
              geology majors, as compared to the previous limit of five students, to         
              obtain a fundamental understanding of geologic computing concepts. The         
              purchase of computers, software, and peripherals allows the outfitting         
              of the student laboratory, which now permits the use of computers to           
              solve a variety of geologic problems. The college will contribute an           
              amount equal to the award.
