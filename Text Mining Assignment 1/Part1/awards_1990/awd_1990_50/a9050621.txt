Abstract    :
              The physics department at Whittier College is creating a versatile             
              computer laboratory with 10 Macintosh SE's and assorted hardware and           
              software.  This laboratory will be the foundation for the newly re-            
              established physics major on campus.  The laboratory will be used              
              immediately in the introductory calculus-based and algebra-based               
              physics courses.  The curriculum and laboratories in the calculus-             
              based course are being redesigned to take advantage of the                     
              pedagogical benefits of computer technology.  Students will be                 
              allowed to explore lecture material on computers during the same               
              class session the material is introduced in lecture.  Because of the           
              laboratory's versatility, much of its equipment will continue to               
              serve the students as they progress through their undergraduate                
              careers.  Project personnel will actively disseminate their                    
              experience establishing the computer laboratory and re-establishing            
              the physics major.  The college is matching the award with an equal            
              amount of funds.
