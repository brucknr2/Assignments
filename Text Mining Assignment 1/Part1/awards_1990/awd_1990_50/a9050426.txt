Abstract    :
              The project is concerned with computer design tools                            
              (CAD/CAE/CASE) to support the total integration of "systems                    
              engineering" techniques into the electrical and computer                       
              engineering undergraduate curriculum beginning at the sophomore                
              level.  It is an innovative approach that directly addresses the               
              need to improve the effectiveness of teaching design skills.  The              
              new tools provided a thread through eight undergraduate courses                
              to link hardware and software, to connect classroom theory with                
              laboratory experiences, and to emphasize the modeling aspect of                
              design.  The courses affected extend from the sophomore through                
              the senior years.  The equipment selected will provide high                    
              technology tools, both hardware and software, that use the state-              
              of-the-art modelling techniques.  The use of these tools will                  
              enable students to create through simulation and emulation,                    
              relevant and accurate models of real-world problems.  With the                 
              use of these educational tools we will be able to train effective              
              and productive engineers to cope with the quality and time-to-                 
              market issues that are major concerns in U.S. industry today.
