Abstract    :
              A laminar flow hood, two CO2 incubators, an ultrafreezer, a cryogenic          
              freezer, and an inverted microscope are allowing the development of a          
              cell culture facility for undergraduates. The students can establish           
              and maintain cell lines, culture viruses, establish lymphocyte cultures        
              and raise and screen monoclonal antibodies. Some of these techniques           
              are being used in the introductory course, while others are being              
              incorporated into Microbiology, Cellular/Molecular Biology, and                
              Immunology courses. Introduction of students to these contemporary             
              biological techniques will help them to compete more successfully for          
              careers after graduation from Adams State, a school which serves a             
              rural area with a high minority population. The school will contribute         
              an amount equal to the award.
