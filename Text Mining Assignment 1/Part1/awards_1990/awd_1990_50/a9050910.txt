Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This proposal calls for the development of a field course in              
              Marine Geophysics that will concentrate on seismic reflection                  
              data acquisition, processing and interpretation.  Students will                
              develop proposals that describe an experiment and present a plan               
              of attack to address the problem.  One or two projects will be                 
              undertaken as a group effort.  This will involve short cruises in              
              the coastal waters of the Gulf of Mexico and Galveston Bay.  Our               
              results will be published as a group effort.
