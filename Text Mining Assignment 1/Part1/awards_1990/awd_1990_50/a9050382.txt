Abstract    :
              The purpose of this project is to develop an advanced image                    
              processing laboratory for use in a new course in image processing as           
              well as for undergraduate projects and research.  The equipment for            
              the project consists of high-resolution cameras; high-speed image              
              digitizers; AT computers; and a local area network.  The students use          
              the cameras to observe both moving and stationary objects, then the            
              objects are digitized and stored in memory.  Finally, the students             
              develop algorithms that communicate with a central knowledge base,             
              and process the images.  Included in the laboratory experience are             
              experiments such as identifying a moving object in a stationary                
              background, then calculating the velocity and acceleration of the              
              object.  The project allows students to apply theoretical concepts             
              to the solution of very practical problems.                                    
                                                                                             
              The award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal               
              investigator's institution.
