Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to The Reis Biological Station of St.                
              Louis University to acquire equipment for the development of a                 
              quantitative-based field course in aquatic biology.  The equipment             
              to be purchased includes an aluminum jon boat, water sampling                  
              equipment, plankton sampling equipment, dissolved oxygen meter,                
              portable oxygen meter, portable water analysis kit, current                    
              velocity meter, stereozoom and compound microscopes, and a color               
              video system for the dissecting and compound microscopes.  This                
              equipment will be used to interrelate the physical and chemical                
              characteristic of various Ozark aquatic habitats with their                    
              respective biological communities.  In addition to the 75 aquatic              
              ecology students to be served over a five-year period, the                     
              equipment will also be used by other classes utilizing the Reis                
              Biological Station.  Thus, the equipment will impact on                        
              approximately 675 students over the next five years.  The grantee              
              is matching this award with non-Federal sources.
