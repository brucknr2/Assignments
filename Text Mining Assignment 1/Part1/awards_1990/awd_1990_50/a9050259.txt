Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              By the end of the century, technology could allow all Americans access         
              to the organized information and knowledge of our civilization.  The           
              television set cum computer chip could be linked by broadband networks         
              or in other ways to archieves of digitized information, including text,        
              sound and moving images.  Such a development would hold profound               
              educational and unique educational opportunity; examine the educational        
              and social benefits of this development for new and existing learners;         
              and conduct and disseminate the results of this inquiry in a way that          
              alerts public and private decision-makers to actions that can affect           
              this unique opportunity.  Specifically, this activity will:                    
                                                                                             
              o   synthesize what is presently known about factors affecting the             
                  development and cost of the digital home terminal; switched                
                  broadband communications to the home, school and work place; and           
                  public and commercial digital databases;                                   
              o   assess the educational and social benefits of a national information       
                  infrastructure for use in and outside of school; and describe new          
                  options for public and private financing of this infrastructure for        
                  educational use;                                                           
              o   develop descriptions of a series of contingent options for getting         
                  from here to there;                                                        
              o   assess the effect on the direction and rate of development of the          
                  national information infrastructure, if public and private decision-       
                  makers were to take into account the educational needs that                
                  electronic information services could serve;                               
              o   assess the reaction of affected educational constituencies,                
                  including reformist movements, to this new educational opportunity,        
                  and to effects on publicly-financed schooling; and                         
                  strive actively during and at the onclusion of the study to                
                  disseminate the concept and results of this inquiry.
