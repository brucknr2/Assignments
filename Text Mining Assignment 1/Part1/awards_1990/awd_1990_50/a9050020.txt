Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The University of Wisconsin--Milwaukee will develop an                         
              innovative program for the science and mathematics                             
              preparation of elementary teachers entitled "Consolidated                      
              Math-Science Curriculum for Elementary Teachers."  The                         
              science content core will consist of a series of twelve one-                   
              credit minicourses which will cover the basic science needed                   
              for elementary teaching and a one-credit/Science/Technology                    
              Society capstone course.  The mathematics core will consist                    
              of a new two-semester sequence guided by the NCTM standards.                   
              Both the mathematics and science courses will utilize                          
              manipulatives and laboratory work and will emphasize inquiry                   
              oriented and activity based learning.  The mathematics and                     
              science methods courses will be coordinated with the content                   
              courses.  Faculty from mathematics and the sciences will                       
              collaborate with faculty from the school of education in                       
              establishing and evaluating the program.  The University of                    
              Wisconsin--Milwaukee is one of the Project 30 institutions, a                  
              three-year project to redesign teacher education curricula.                    
              The Center for Teacher Education at UWM has been designated                    
              as a Center for Excellence in the UW system, and the Center                    
              has forged strong ties with the Milwaukee business and                         
              education community for the recruitment of minorities and the                  
              promotion of science and math education and literacy in the                    
              Milwaukee public schools.   The university's cost sharing                      
              will be 39% of NSF's contribution.
