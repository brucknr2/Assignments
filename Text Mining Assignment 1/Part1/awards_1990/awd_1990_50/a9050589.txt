Abstract    :
              A self-contained non-recirculating dilution refrigerator is the hub            
              of a modern low temperature laboratory facility suitable for                   
              undergraduates.  The refrigerator gives students the ability to                
              perform dramatic experiments dealing with many contemporary                    
              research topics, such as quantum mechanical tunneling, quantum Hall            
              effect, quasiparticle dynamics, and the behavior of mesoscopic                 
              systems.  In addition, the design of experimental apparatus for the            
              machine allows students to use the physical concepts introduced in             
              formal coursework:  temperature and thermometry, heat capacity,                
              blackbody radiation, and thermal conductivity.  The principal users            
              of the equipment are junior-year honors students and senior-year               
              physics students participating in an advanced laboratory program.              
              By providing a rich, up-to-date research laboratory experience for             
              students, the project is broadening their exposure to contemporary             
              topics and experimental techniques, thereby preparing them better              
              for graduate study and/or industry.  The refrigerator also captures            
              the interest of younger physics majors, and so provide a powerful              
              incentive for early participation in research and further study in             
              physics.  The college is matching the award with an equal amount               
              of funds.
