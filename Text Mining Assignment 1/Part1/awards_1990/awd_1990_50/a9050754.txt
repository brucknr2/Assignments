Abstract    :
              The workstations in an undergraduate power systems laboratory                  
              will be upgraded so that the controller/data logging computers                 
              are compatible with available computing hardware and software.                 
              The workstations will be included in the college and university                
              computer network.  An instrumentation package is included that                 
              will capture data at a sufficient rate to calculate average and                
              room currents and voltages, average power, reactive volt amperes,              
              shaft sped and torque angles of power system components being                  
              operated at 60 Hz, with reasonable harmonic content.  The                      
              calculated data from the instrumentation package can be used in                
              feedback control.  The calculated data can be logged at 0.05                   
              seconds/data point and can be displayed on the controller                      
              monitor.  The capacity of the laboratory is increased from 12 to               
              18 students at a time.
