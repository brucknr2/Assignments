Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The Interactive Mathematics Project will develop a new                    
              high school mathematics curriculum built around individual                     
              units which are problem-based rather than subject-based.                       
              Each unit will feature a family of problems with intrinsic                     
              mathematical interest or application to physics, economics,                    
              art, sociology, or other fields.  Concepts and skills will be                  
              learned in the context of solving problems.  Manipulative                      
              materials, cooperative learning, writing as an adjunct to                      
              mathematics learning, and the use of graphing calculators and                  
              computers will be incorporated into the classroom                              
              instruction.  Families will become involved in the curriculum                  
              through the addition of FAMILY MATH classes.  The new                          
              curriculum is to replace the three year high school sequence                   
              Algebra I/Geometry/Algebra II.  In California, this                            
              curriculum meets the entrance requirements for the University                  
              of California and the California State University during the                   
              field testing of the material.
