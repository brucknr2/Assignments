Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The University of Nebraska will undertake a project to create                  
              computer-based chemistry lesson planning tools for use in                      
              secondary science methods courses.  The project will assemble                  
              a database of chemistry lessons and activities which will be                   
              accessed through HyperCard for lesson planning.  The lesson                    
              planning tools will be created by merging existing databases,                  
              such as Doing Chemistry and MicroScale, with contributions                     
              from secondary science methods teachers and practicing high                    
              school chemistry teachers.  The tools may be personalized and                  
              adapted to individual teaching styles and approaches.  CAI                     
              materials showing how to use the tools for preservice                          
              secondary methods students will also be developed.  The                        
              software will be distributed free of cost to every secondary                   
              science methods instructor in the United States.  The cost                     
              sharing by the university and other sources will be 38% of                     
              NSF's contribution.
