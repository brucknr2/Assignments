Abstract    :
              The purpose of this project is to modernize the mechanics                      
              laboratory to a level beyond that normally encountered in an                   
              undergraduate teaching environment.  This has been accomplished                
              through the acquisition of a state-of-the-art testing machine and              
              accessories.  This apparatus is interfaced with a microcomputer for            
              automatic data collection and analysis.  The study of materials                
              properties is enhanced by permitting accurate determination of the             
              stress-strain behavior of materials and associated properties such             
              as Poisson's ratio and the modulus of elasticity.  The laboratory's            
              capability is expanded in a broad range of experimental areas such             
              as fatigue, creep, and fracture mechanics.  This equipment greatly             
              increases the students' exposure to modern experimental techniques             
              and better prepares them for graduate studies and professional                 
              work.  The award is being matched by an equal amount from the                  
              principal investigator's institution.
