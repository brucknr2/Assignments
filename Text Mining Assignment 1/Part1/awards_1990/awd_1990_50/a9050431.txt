Abstract    :
              The Physics Department is acquiring instrumentation which provide              
              students in the Optics Concentration with hands-on exposure to the             
              principles and application of optical crystallography above and                
              beyond the level normally discussed in undergraduate optics and solid          
              state physics courses.  The department is purchasing a temperature             
              controlled fluid bath, a polarizing microscope, crystal models, a              
              high voltage power supply and crystal polishing equipment.  These              
              instruments allow students to grow high quality water-soluble                  
              crystals and to characterize their optical properties.  It enables             
              them to construct and study a Glan-Thompson polarizer, a nonlinear             
              frequency doubler and an electro-optic modulator.  This project is             
              singificant because it brings to the undergraduate laboratory more             
              extensive exposure to the properties of birefringent nonlinear and             
              electro-optic crystals.  These materials are currently the object of           
              a great deal study in graduate, government, and industrial research            
              laboratories.  The project enables devices constructed from them at            
              an earlier stage of their careers.  Finally, it serves other                   
              institutions through the publication of student lab experiments which          
              are being developed.
