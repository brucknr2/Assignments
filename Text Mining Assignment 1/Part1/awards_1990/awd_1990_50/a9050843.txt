Abstract    :
              This project develops a modern, up-to-date power laboratory that               
              provides realistic instruction in actual power systems operation.              
              Digital simulation software is being acquired for transient, load              
              flow and harmonic analysis.  An analog power system simulator is               
              being assembled, using control devices and instruments found in                
              actual power systems.  The equipment being purchased includes two              
              5 KW generators with speed controls, a switched capacitor power                
              factor correction unit and a harmonic monitor.  These items,                   
              together with an existing 34 KW generator allow experiments in                 
              power electronics and analyses of present day problems such as                 
              harmonics and ground system voltages.  The project addresses the               
              need for more emphasis on power technology education.                          
                                                                                             
              The award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal               
              investigator's institution.
