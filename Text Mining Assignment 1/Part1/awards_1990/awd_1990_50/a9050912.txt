Abstract    :
              The central equipment in the Solid State Laboratory is a scanning              
              tunneling electron microscope.  Exciting developments in the area              
              of scanning tunneling/atomic force microscopy provide new avenues              
              for the study of solid state structures.  Students in four                     
              disciplines: chemistry, physics, biology, and earth sciences                   
              benefit from the use of the laboratory as understanding the nature             
              of the solid state is a central part of all four disciplines.  The             
              grantee provides funds for this project that are an equal match                
              for the NSF award.
