Abstract    :
              We propose to create a next workstation laboratory to complement               
              the two-semester, junior level sequence in electromagnetics                    
              required to all electrical engineering majors.  Initially, the                 
              laboratory would be an optional part of the courses, with perhaps              
              a few homework assignments requiring use of the laboratory.                    
              However, the goal would be to eventually integrate the laboratory              
              into the coursework in a more substantive role.                                
                                                                                             
              To accomplish our objective we have already begun developing an                
              interactive software package.  The programs developed are                      
              collective know as EM Notebooks.  To create the Noteboooks, a                  
              powerful software language called Mathematica is used.                         
              Mathematica has a feature that can be used to hierarchically                   
              structure text, equations, and graphics.  Thus, the EM Notebooks               
              contain animated sequences of EM phenomena such as waves                       
              propagating in a waveguide, and the user can interactively change              
              parameter, such as frequency, with the moving picture altering in              
              response.
