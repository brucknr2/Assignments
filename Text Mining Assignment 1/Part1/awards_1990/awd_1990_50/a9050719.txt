Abstract    :
              An integrated stress analysis laboratory, mainly for senior                    
              undergraduates, which will let them perform various experiments                
              using modern data acquisition equipment and techniques is                      
              developed and built.  The scientific principles which will govern              
              the proposed laboratory are rather simple; they are based on                   
              utilization of several well-developed techniques of experimental               
              mechanics coupled with a digital image analysis system for                     
              optical data acquisition (photoelastic and moire fringes) and                  
              analog-to-digital convertor for electrical data acquisition                    
              (strain gauges, load cells, displacement sensors).                             
                                                                                             
              The integrated approach (modern instrumentation and various                    
              experimental techniques together with available analytical or                  
              numerical solutions) will be an indispensable tool for the                     
              undergraduate student to really understand the value of the                    
              experiment and the need for critical analysis of results.
