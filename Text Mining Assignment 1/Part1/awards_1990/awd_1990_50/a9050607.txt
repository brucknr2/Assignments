Abstract    :
              The college is developing a course in molecular biology to provide             
              women students with a modern, rigorous, and integrated biology                 
              curriculum. Laboratories are designed to develop critical thinking and         
              data analysis skills which directly involve students in state-of-the-          
              art molecular methods. The department is purchasing an ultracentrifuge,        
              high speed centrifuge and rotors, microfuges, DNA sequencing equipment,        
              gel blotting units, slab gel dryer, and hybridization apparatus. This          
              makes possible the isolation and characterization of macromolecules,           
              cloning and sequencing of DNA fragments, and nucleic acid and protein          
              blotting. These techniques are being incorporated into project-                
              oriented laboratories in the new Molecular Biology course. Fundamental         
              knowledge and skills on protein and nucleic acid analysis which                
              students have acquired in their core courses are being applied and             
              enhanced through molecular biology projects which emphasize isolation          
              and characterization of functional domains of DNA and proteins. The            
              college is contributing 104% of the award for this project.
