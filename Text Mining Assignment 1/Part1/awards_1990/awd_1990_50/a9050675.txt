Abstract    :
                   This project modernizes the current digital hardware                      
              laboratory in terms of both equipment and pedagogy.  It                        
              supports a redesigned hardware development system and                          
              redesigned laboratory projects.  The concept of a large                        
              student project that extends over a six month period is                        
              retained and the construction of a fully functional                            
              minicomputer from basic integrated circuit components is                       
              still required.  New student projects will  emphasize                          
              programmable logic devices in addition to hardwired circuits,                  
              and will incorporate modern simulation and logic minimization                  
              tools.  In the microprogrammed-control phase of the project,                   
              the new equipment will offer greatly enhanced interactive                      
              design and debugging capabilities.                                             
                   This project is significant because it provides a                         
              laboratory in which  undergraduate students can build designs                  
              using programmable logic devices as well as modern simulation                  
              and logic minimization tools.
