Abstract    :
              A new laboratory course is being developed that combines the                   
              principles and methods from several interrelated areas: molecular              
              genetics, cell biology, biochemistry;, immunology, and developmental           
              biology. Four pieces of equipment have been purchased that are                 
              fundamental components of a modern biology laboratory: a refrigerated          
              high speed centrifuge, a laminar flow hood, a tissue culture incubator         
              and a vibratome. The equipment is being used in an introductory cell           
              biology course, in plant and animal physiology, in independent study           
              and honors research in addition to the new integrated course. The              
              project demonstrates important scientific principles, such as                  
              separation science, culture of animal and plant cells, monoclonal              
              antibody production, identification of biomolecules in tissues, as well        
              as a balanced treatment of these principles. It is also a unique               
              solution to limited time and resources. The college is contributing an         
              amount equal to the award.
