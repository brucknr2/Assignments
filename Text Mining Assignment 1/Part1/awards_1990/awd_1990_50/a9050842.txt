Abstract    :
              The combination of epifluorescence microscopy, phase contrast and              
              differential interference contrast (DIC) optics, and high resolution           
              video imaging have revolutionized our understanding of cell biology;           
              particularly in the areas of cell motility and the cytoskeleton,               
              intracellular trafficking, cellular organelle behavior, intracellular          
              signaling and protein dynamics. These techniques are being integrated          
              into the curriculum through the purchase of a combination phase, DIC,          
              and epifluorescence microscope, 5 phase contrast conversion kits for           
              existing brightfield microscopes, a high resolution video system, and          
              an inverted phase contrast microscope. Fluorescence microscopy will be         
              used in conjunction with immunofluorescent staining for the                    
              subcellular localization of proteins, and fluorescent probe staining           
              for membranes and organelles. Inverted and upright phase contrast and          
              DIC microscopy will be used for observations on living cells. The video        
              system will allow for group observation and discussion of cellular             
              events. The equipment will be used in student research projects as well        
              as the Cell Biology course. The college will contribute an amount equal        
              to the award.
