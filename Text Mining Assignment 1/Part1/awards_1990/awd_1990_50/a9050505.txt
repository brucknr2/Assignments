Abstract    :
              Students in precalculus and calculus are benefiting from a laboratory          
              equipped with Hyundai computers running MathCad.  The curriculum that          
              this lab supports allows students to explore and better understand             
              mathematical concepts and emphasizes more realistic and interesting            
              problems.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              The institution will contribute an amount equal to the award.
