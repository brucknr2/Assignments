Abstract    :
              A one-year sequence of laboratory and field experiences in                     
              hydrogeology is being developed with the aid of new laboratory, field,         
              and computing equipment. An integrated experience is being developed in        
              which students use a piece of field or laboratory equipment to collect         
              data. They are then given a data set from a hazardous waste site and           
              asked to interpret these data. Computers are used to store and process         
              the data and to model the waste site. Exercises include grain size             
              analysis of sediments, interpreting gamma logs and geologists' logs to         
              make geological cross-sections, measurements of water levels and               
              construction of water table maps and well hydrographs, performance of          
              slug tests and analysis of results, aquifer test analysis, collection          
              of water samples from wells and construction of contaminant                    
              distribution plumes, stream gauging, conducting and interpreting               
              results of electromagnetic surveys, and development of computer models         
              from ground water flow, contaminant transport and capture zone                 
              analysis. The final project is the preparation of a report summarizing         
              the year's work. The university will contribute an amount equal to the         
              award.
