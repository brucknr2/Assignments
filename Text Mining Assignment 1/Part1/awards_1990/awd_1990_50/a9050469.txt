Abstract    :
              The Department of Physics and Astronomy at Southwest Missouri State            
              University is instituting a required undergraduate research                    
              component for its majors in physics and engineering physics.  The              
              new project course sequence, in addition to an ongoing Honors                  
              Project course, means all majors are undertaking experimental                  
              projects.  This project is adding equipment which enables students             
              to do projects involving the thermal and optical properties of thin            
              films and surfaces, and the properties of optical images.  The                 
              University is matching the award with an equal amount of funds.
