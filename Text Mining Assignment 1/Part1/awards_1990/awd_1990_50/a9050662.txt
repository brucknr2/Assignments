Abstract    :
              Funds were requested for a flame/furnace atomic absorption                     
              spectrometer and microwave sample digestion system to be used by               
              both Florida Institute of Technology and Brevard Community College.            
              It was located in a new Center for Chemical Instrumentation, a                 
              modern 4000 square foot laboratory complex jointly managed by FIT              
              and BCC.  At FIT it was used by undergraduates in several courses              
              offered in the Chemistry Department.  At BCC it was used by                    
              students in an innovative new Instrument Technician program.                   
              Because instrument based analytical chemistry is critical to the               
              nation's high technology industries, the demand for skilled                    
              analytical chemists and instrument technicians is expected to                  
              remain high for many years.  The equipment of this proposal was                
              used to help educate and train those chemists and technicians.
