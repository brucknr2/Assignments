Abstract    :
                   A new laboratory curriculum in calculus-based and algebra-                
              based introductory physics courses will be developed.  In this                 
              curriculum the acquisition and analysis of the data is                         
              completed with the help of microcomputers.  The students will                  
              use the computers to collect data then utilize computational                   
              software to:  build a theoretical model of the phenomena being                 
              investigated; reduce the experimental data; perform fundamental                
              statistical and error tests; analyze the experimental data; and                
              finally synthesize the experimental results with the                           
              theoretical model.  The equipment selected for this project                    
              includes:  IBM compatible computers and printers; computer                     
              interfaced measuring devices designed to allow for                             
              experimentation with a broad range of kinematic, electrical and                
              heat phenomena; a spreadsheet and a mathematical computational                 
              tool.  This new curriculum model will result in significant                    
              improvements in both the qualitative and quantitative                          
              understanding of the phenomena and produce large numbers of                    
              students with fundamental investigative skills directly                        
              transferable to industry and/or continued research.
