Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Education Development Center, Inc. (EDC), and the Cleveland Education          
              Fund have formed a partnership with the Cleveland Public Schools to            
              assist the district improve its elementary science program.  The               
              primary goal of the collaborative project is to build the Cleveland            
              Public Schools' capacity to employ a staff development model which             
              will lead to the implementation of an exemplary inquiry-based science          
              program.  It is anticipated that by the end of the project every               
              elementary school in the city will have selected a new hands-on                
              science program and have an informed principal and a team of teachers          
              ready to support others in their building as they implement the new            
              program.  The project provides an opportunity to examine in depth the          
              change process required in a system which is firmly committed to               
              decentralization and school-based management at the same time that it          
              is attempting to change the way science is taught in each elementary           
              school.  It is, therefore, anticipated that the project's assessment           
              will increase our understanding of effective staff development models          
              for both enhancing the teaching of elementary science and for                  
              assuring the successful institutionalization of inquiry-based science          
              programs.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              The cost sharing for the project will be almost 400% of the NSF                
              portion.
