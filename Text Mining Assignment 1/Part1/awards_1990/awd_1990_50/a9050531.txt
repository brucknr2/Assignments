Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The rapid and continuing growth in the significance of the use of              
              nuclear magnetic resonance techniques in solving structural                    
              problems requires that a modern curriculum place considerable                  
              emphasis on both theory and practice in the area.  Through the                 
              acquisition of a high-field NMR spectrometer, the institution has              
              improved the course content in five laboratory courses offered in              
              the Chemistry Department:  Organic Chemistry I and II, Inorganic               
              Chemistry, Instrumental Analysis, and Senior REsearch.  The                    
              acquisition of the instrumentation has also resulted in                        
              improvements in the associated lecture portions of these courses.              
              The Gemini 200-RT system has been utilized to permit the                       
              introduction of new experiments into each of the laboratories and              
              to augment techniques available to undergraduate research                      
              participants.  The project has been of major significance because              
              it enabled the Chemistry Department to bring it curricular                     
              content to standards recognized by national consensus.
