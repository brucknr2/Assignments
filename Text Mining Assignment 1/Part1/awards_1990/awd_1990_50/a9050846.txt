Abstract    :
              Support is requested for improvements to the Environmental                     
              simulation Laboratory.  Established with a major NSF grant in                  
              1972, the laboratory setting.  Students can simulate the visual                
              quality of full scale real world physical environments using                   
              small scale three dimensional models.  A computer-aided periscope              
              lens and video camera records at eye level in motion what a                    
              person would see walking or driving in proximity to a proposed                 
              design.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              Recent advances in computer simulation techniques make it                      
              possible to update and improve the laboratory equipment.  These                
              advances, including new color display technology, digital memory               
              and microprocessor quality images a reality even on desktop                    
              computers.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              Three of our personal computer workstations are equipped with                  
              raster graphics adapter cards capable of converting images to                  
              digital format.  Using application software, these images are                  
              then manipulated and combined with other images.  For example, a               
              view of the real side can be combined with a view of a scale                   
              model to explain the visual effects of a proposed design on the                
              environment.  For the  simulation of movement, one of the three                
              workstations is equipped with an animation module and application              
              software to render sequential views of a computer generated                    
              model.
