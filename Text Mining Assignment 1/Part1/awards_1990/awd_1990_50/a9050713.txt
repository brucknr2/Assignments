Abstract    :
              In this project a high performance, multi-user computer system                 
              supports senior-level realtime instruction.  Students use the                  
              networked, graphics-oriented system for data acquisition, reduction,           
              analysis and presentation.                                                     
                                                                                             
              The laboratory system provides high speed analog-to-digital and                
              digital-to-analog conversion; TTL-compatible digital input and                 
              output; programmable counters/timers; two large screen, high                   
              resolution color graphics workstations; and access to the campus               
              ethernet backbone.  Both low-level and icon-based data acquisition             
              and analysis software are available as well as a realtime version of           
              UNIX operating system.  Also included is the industry standard                 
              networking and computer graphics software.                                     
                                                                                             
              This distributed system allows students to experience modern,                  
              distributed laboratory computation.  Individual students will be able          
              to simultaneously edit source code and reduce data remotely through            
              network access, while one project group acquires new data and another          
              group analyzes and displays old data on the two workstations directly          
              connected to the realtime host.  Student access to the specialized             
              hardware and software is maximized.                                            
                                                                                             
              The award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal               
              investigator's institution.
