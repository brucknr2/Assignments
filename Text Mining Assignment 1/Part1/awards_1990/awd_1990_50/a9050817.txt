Abstract    :
              As future scientists and citizens, it is important for students to know        
              how to work with and evaluate quantitative data. While the speed and           
              graphical capabilities of computers make them ideal for such tasks, few        
              students have used them in this context. The department is equipping an        
              undergraduate geoscience laboratory with seven portable computers that         
              will be networked together. About the same size and weight as a                
              microscope, these instruments are to be used in a similar fashion - as         
              general purpose "digital" laboratory tools which will be integrated            
              into laboratories at all levels of the geoscience curriculum,                  
              including the large introductory course that has a large proportion of         
              non-science majors enrolled. The colleges are contributing an amount           
              equal to the award.
