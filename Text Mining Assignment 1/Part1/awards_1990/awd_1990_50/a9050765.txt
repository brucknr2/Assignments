Abstract    :
              This project develops an automated microwave measurements laboratory           
              used in conjunction with a senior elective lecture course in microwave         
              networks.  The bench test equipment is of industrial quality and is            
              used by sixteen students per session for ten weekly sessions.  The             
              equipment consists of signal generators, computer controlled measuring         
              instruments and passive microwave components.  This project provides           
              students with "hands-on" experience in the automated measurements              
              techniques used in most microwave design laboratories in industry.             
              This laboratory experience enhances the students ability to function           
              as a contributor in the communications laboratory environment.  The            
              award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal                   
              investigator's institution.
