Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Puerto Rico Center for Science and Engineering (RCSE)                      
              plans to develop, test, and disseminate  a 7-12th grade                        
              science and mathematics curriculum as a pilot Center for the                   
              NSTA Scope, Sequence, and Coordination Project in an effort                    
              to bring about major reforms in science and mathematics                        
              education.  This project will focus on grades 7-9, will                        
              utilize techniques developed in the Science, Technology, and                   
              Society reform movement, and will integrate mathematics with                   
              the sciences in its approach.  Five curriculum teams will                      
              work closely with NSTA to develop materials in Spanish                         
              which, after testing and refining, are to be disseminated in                   
              Spanish and in English translation to mainland school                          
              districts.
