Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry will purchase a Fourier Transform                  
              Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (FT-NMR) spectrometer for use in                    
              undergraduate education.  A Fourier Transform Nuclear Magnetic                 
              Resonance facility will be established for use in undergraduate                
              instrumental analysis courses and by research students enrolled                
              in the four colleges in the City of Memphis.  The center will                  
              be located at Memphis State University, which will provide the                 
              matching funds and provide for maintenance of the facility (and                
              will, therefore, retain title to the facility and arrange a                    
              schedule for its use).  However the center will also provide                   
              for the instructional and research needs at three smaller                      
              colleges: LeMoyne Owen College, Christian Brothers College and                 
              Rhodes College.  The integration of C-13 FT NMR (along with the                
              possibility of running coupled, decoupled, off-resonance                       
              decoupled, 2-D experiments, etc.)  into the undergraduate                      
              curriculum will fill a glaring need in molecular spectroscopy                  
              in all of the Memphis area institutions and also provide for                   
              routine spectral characterization of compounds generated in                    
              undergraduate research projects.  The inclusion of LeMoyne-Owen                
              College, a historically Black liberal arts college, in the                     
              project, as well as the sizable percentage of minorities at the                
              other institutions, ensures that the facility will provide for                 
              enhanced educational opportunities for minority students.
