Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The Hansen Planetarium proposes the creation, writing, and                
              production of a 50-minute star theatre program, Cosmic                         
              Catastrophes: A Planet At Risk?, aimed at informally educating                 
              over a million individuals regarding the vulnerability of our                  
              Earth.  The further production of four interactive exhibits is                 
              planned to accompany the program.  This program will be                        
              marketed and distributed at a nominal charge to 250 national                   
              planetariums, with 50 additional production packets planned for                
              loan.  In this fashion, top-quality, accurate, and timely                      
              science education can be guaranteed to a large selection of                    
              audiences.                                                                     
                                                                                             
                   Scientific research tells us that catastrophes of global                  
              and interplanetary proportions have happened in the past, there                
              is evidence that they could occur in the present, and they pose                
              an imminent danger in the future.  The utilization of expert                   
              consultants, in conjunction with Hansen Planetarium staff, will                
              insure this program presents the most current information                      
              available about these cosmic catastrophes.  Its interactive                    
              format is designed to stimulate a proactive approach to problem                
              solution on the part of the audience, especially in reference                  
              to ecological or environmental issues.  The star show format,                  
              with its dynamic special effects, will make scientific theories                
              surrounding cosmic catastrophes accessible and excitiong.
