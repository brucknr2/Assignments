Abstract    :
              Distributed computing is an important aspect of many fields of                 
              computer science including architecture, operating systems,                    
              programming languages, data base management, algorithms, and                   
              artificial intelligence.  Undergraduates are usually introduced to             
              this subject in an operating systems course during a study of process          
              control and concurrency.  There is, however, a lack of programming             
              assignments which give students practical experience with these                
              concepts within a single semester course.  This project establishes            
              a laboratory and develops an innovative laboratory curriculum which            
              can serve as a model for undergraduate operating systems courses in            
              other programs.  The laboratory is workstation-based and uses the              
              UNIX operating system in a windowing environment.  Fourteen                    
              workstations and a server have been purchased and networked.  A                
              series of experiments and student projects based on virtual rings are          
              being implemented, and a laboratory manual is being produced which             
              describes student assignments covering most of the topics contained            
              in a standard operating systems course.  In addition, debugging tools          
              are being integrated with the windows to allow students to monitor             
              concurrent computations.                                                       
                                                                                             
              The award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal               
              investigator's institution.
