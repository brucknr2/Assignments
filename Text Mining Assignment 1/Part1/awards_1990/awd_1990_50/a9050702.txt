Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to the Department of Zoology at North                
              Carolina State University to purchase equipment which will provide             
              intense, hands-on experience for students in advanced cell and                 
              molecular biology laboratories.  Funds will be used to purchase an             
              advanced light microscope, with accessories for phase contrast,                
              Hoffman modulation contrast, and fluorescence microscopy, and the              
              capabilities for recording the images using these techniques.                  
              Students will probe the cytology of selected cell types and basic              
              principles of cell biology by employing current microscopical                  
              methods for the characterization and analysis of cellular structure            
              and function.  This equipment will be a resource to be shared by               
              students from several courses and undergraduate research projects              
              and will enhance their training in modern optical techniques.  The             
              grantee is matching this award with non-Federal sources.
