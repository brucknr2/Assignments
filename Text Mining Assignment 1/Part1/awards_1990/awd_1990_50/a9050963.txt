Abstract    :
                   This project provides a realistic laboratory environment                  
              for training  undergraduate computer science majors in the                     
              tools and techniques of software implementation.  A                            
              computer-aided software engineering (CASE) laboratory with                     
              sixteen networked workstations is to be established.  The                      
              workstations are to be configured with a variety of                            
              specialized programs used by software professionals for the                    
              design, implementation, and maintenance of large software                      
              systems.  Two senior level software design and implementation                  
              courses are to be developed for the laboratory.  In the first                  
              course, students study software design using "Software                         
              through Pictures," a CASE tool for structured analysis and                     
              design.  In the second course, the focus is on                                 
              implementation, testing, and maintenance in the ADA                            
              environment.                                                                   
                   Undergraduates are currently poorly trained in software                   
              design and implementation.  This project will establish a                      
              laboratory with state-of-the-art CASE tools for use by                         
              undergraduates in software design and implementation and will                  
              address the nation's need for well-trained software                            
              designers.
