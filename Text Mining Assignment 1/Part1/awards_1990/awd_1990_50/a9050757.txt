Abstract    :
              Calculus students are using a new computer laboratory equipped                 
              with Macintosh computers running Mathematica to perform                        
              experiments and do their own investigations.  The are learning to              
              confirm or reject graphical evidence with numerical and symbolic               
              computations and numerical evidence with graphical and symbolic                
              computations.  A student guide has been produced that helps the                
              students use Mathematica.  The institution is contributing an                  
              amount equal to the award.
