Abstract    :
              A computer-aided test station, including bust test equipment                   
              (power supplies, signal generator, digital oscilloscope,                       
              multimeters, switching unit), a microcomputer controller and                   
              appropriate software will be established for the testing of thick              
              and thin film hybrid circuits.  The computer and test equipment                
              will add major capabilities not now available in the senior-level              
              hybrid circuit program.                                                        
                                                                                             
              The thick film technology program at Drexel serves approximately               
              60 students per year.  The Thick Film Laboratory serves as a                   
              circuit prototyping facility where students work in design groups              
              of 4 to 6 to fabricate circuits of their own design.  All                      
              fabrication processes are done in-house by the students. The                   
              principal purpose of the equipment in this proposal will be the                
              automatically test the functionality of the designed circuits,                 
              with the capability of handling circuits will serve as teaching                
              examples for learning test programming techniques as well as                   
              illustrating basic hybrid circuit concepts.  The equipment will                
              also be used as a design station for circuit layout and                        
              simulation.
