Abstract    :
              A microcomputer based image processing system is being used                    
              primarily to conduct experiments utilizing autoradiographic                    
              receptor binding techniques and will be used to perform                        
              densitometric analyses of film images of the autoradiograms.  The              
              instrument is being used as a research tool for student and                    
              faculty research, and as an instrument that supports various                   
              teaching laboratory exercises that focus on receptor systems in                
              the brain.  The system enables the department to expand the                    
              research opportunities available to neuroscience students, carry               
              out receptor binding studies focusing on discrete regions in the               
              brain, and conduct receptor binding experiments in student                     
              laboratories at lower cost.  The system will be expanded at a                  
              later date to perform image analysis tasks other than                          
              densitometry.  The college is contributing an amount equal to the              
              award.
