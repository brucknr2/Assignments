Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The aim of this project is to improve course content in chemistry              
              laboratories at the institution, with emphasis on organic                      
              chemistry.  Implementation involved acquisition of Fourier                     
              transform infrared spectrophotometer  (FTIR), a modern                         
              ultraviolet-visible recording spectrophotometer (UV-VIS), two gas              
              chromatographs (GC) and other accessories.                                     
                                                                                             
              Student have direct hands-on experience with these instruments                 
              and have acquired skill in interpreting the measurements they                  
              provide.  FTIR and UV-VIS are used for molecular structure                     
              determination and have allowed enhanced knowledge of                           
              structure/property interrelationships.  The new instruments are                
              used in conjunction with computer-assisted molecular graphics and              
              molecular mechanics methods.  New student exercises have been                  
              implemented which take advantage of the increased capabilities of              
              the equipment.  GC is a valuable adjunct to these methods because              
              it allows rapid separation, identification, and quantification of              
              organic substances.                                                            
                                                                                             
              The institution contributed to the project in an amount equal to               
              the NSF funds.
