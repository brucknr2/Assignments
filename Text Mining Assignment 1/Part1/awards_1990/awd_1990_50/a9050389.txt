Abstract    :
              This project updates and improves the Electrical Engineering                   
              Technology Electrical Machines and Power Systems Engineering Lab-              
              oratory.  This was accomplished through the acquisition of a power             
              systems simulator, computer control system, motor driven three-phase           
              alternators, and industrial interface.  This equipment provides                
              students with "hands-on" experience in testing, operating, and                 
              analyzing computer controlled power systems, including residential,            
              industrial, and commercial systems.  This grant is being matched by a          
              greater amount, 171%, by the Principal Investigator's institution.
