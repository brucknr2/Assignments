Abstract    :
              Computer-assisted three-dimensional modeling is being developed for            
              analysis of complex biological events. A computer system capable of            
              producing three dimensional simulations of various developmental               
              processes that would be student interactive, has been designed. Once           
              data are obtained and simulated, students can view the event from              
              various perspectives, shade or color any class of tissue, follow               
              specific highlighted areas during the developmental process, and make          
              video movies of any of these. An advanced course is being developed in         
              which a specific problem or system, for example the mechanics of               
              amphibian gastrulation, eye development, patterns of homeobox                  
              containing gene expression during early Drosophila development and how         
              they change in various mutants, neurulation, or heart formation, is            
              studied in detail and simulated. The same equipment will be used to            
              teach intermediate level courses in development or cell biology; this          
              would allow students to interact with the simulations as a visual aid          
              in understanding complex spatial relationships. Third, videos are being        
              made to assist in teaching introductory level courses and these videos         
              will be made available to other colleges. The college will contribute          
              an amount equal to the award.
