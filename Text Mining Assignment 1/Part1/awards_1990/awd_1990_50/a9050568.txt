Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The purpose of this project has been the revision of the first                 
              year chemistry laboratory curriculum at the college to include                 
              new and revised experiments which make use of microcomputers to                
              record and process experimental data.  The equipment which was                 
              acquired includes 10 computer data acquisition and processing                  
              workstations, and an Fourier Transform Infrared spectrophotometer              
              with data analysis computer and spectral analysis software.  The               
              data acquisition workstations are being used in experiments                    
              involving pH and potentiometric titrations, chemical kinetics,                 
              and thermochemistry.  The infrared spectrophotometer and                       
              dedicated computer is being used to analyze the reactants and                  
              products of organic reactions which are being introduced into the              
              first year curriculum which more realistically represents modern               
              chemical laboratory work, and therefore better educates science                
              and engineering students in the principles and practices of                    
              modern chemistry.                                                              
                                                                                             
              The institution is contributing to the project in an amount equal              
              to the NSF funds.
