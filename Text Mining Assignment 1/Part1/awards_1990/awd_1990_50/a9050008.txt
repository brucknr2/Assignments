Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Proof-of-concept tests of a complete computer-based course covering the        
              standard material in the AB Advanced Placement Calculus Syllabus will be       
                                                                                             
              undertaken in two settings where the same computer-based technology can        
              be used as solutions to different problems.                                    
                                                                                             
              (1)   Middle schools with mathematically precocious students.                  
              (2)   Colleges or Universities where students use the computer                 
                    program for problem solving and tutorial help.                           
                                                                                             
              The computer-based course makes extensive use of graphics, interactive         
              on-line problem solving, and interactive expository techniques                 
              appropriate to the level and complexity of the calculus.  On-line              
              problem solving and exercises are supported by a symbolic computation          
              environment called the Equational Derivation System in which students          
              construct solutions to problems step by step using natural mathematical        
              operations.  The REDUCE computer algebra system is used as an internal         
              algebra engine by this program.  The effectiveness of these main               
              components of the course will be evaluated.  The program runs on               
              UNIX-based color graphics workstations.
