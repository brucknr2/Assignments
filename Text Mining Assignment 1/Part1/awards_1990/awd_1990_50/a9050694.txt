Abstract    :
              Hope College is adding mechanical testing apparatus to enable the              
              introduction of mechanical testing laboratories into an engineering            
              physics program at a liberal arts college.  With this equipment,               
              students are able to investigate experimentally the materials and              
              mechanical members which they have designed and have analysed by               
              computer methods.  Besides gaining a better understanding of                   
              mechanical systems the students learn the capabilities and                     
              limitations of computer models through comparison of theory with               
              experiment.  Four courses are directly enhanced through the                    
              introduction of these laboratories.  The engineering physics                   
              program at Hope College is designed to prepare students interested             
              in engineering and applied physics for direct enrollment in                    
              graduate school.  The college is matching the grant with an equal              
              amount.//
