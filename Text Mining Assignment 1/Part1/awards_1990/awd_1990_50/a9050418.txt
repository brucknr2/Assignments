Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The purpose of this project is to introduce the use of lasers to the           
              instrumental analysis laboratory program at the College of Charleston.         
              The forefront of optical spectroscopic research involves the use of            
              lasers for both atomic and molecular spectroscopy.  The acquisition of         
              the equipment is allowing the establishment of a strong laser component        
              for the course.  The experiments being developed involve quantitative          
              molecular florescence, the quenching of one fluorescent molecule by            
              another, and thermal lens spectroscopy.  The modular approach to               
              construction of the three experiments is helping the students to better        
              understand the design of the experimental set-up.  An additional               
              benefit is the development of alternative projects to those that are           
              currently available in the department for undergraduate senior research        
              by expanding opportunities in atomic and molecular spectroscopy.               
                                                                                             
              The institution is matching the NSF grant with an equal amount of              
              funds.
