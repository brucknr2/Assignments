Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will initiate a hands-on inquiry-based science                    
              curriculum in all the elementary school classrooms of the                      
              Pasadena Unified School District.  The District is urban,                      
              multicultural and multiracial.  The District's partner, the                    
              California Institute of Technology (Caltech), is a preeminent                  
              research university.  Their combined effort will use a method                  
              proven during four years of a very successful partnership                      
              between Caltech and one Pasadena pilot school.  The initial                    
              education for teachers will be presented in small groups each                  
              led by a mentor teacher and a volunteer science professional.                  
              During these group meetings the teachers will have an                          
              opportunity to investigate kit materials which they will use                   
              later in their classrooms.  The small group will work through                  
              the kits in a cooperative learning environment, while the co-                  
              leaders emphasize the philosophy and methods of hands-on                       
              teaching as well as the scientific subject matter which                        
              relates to each kit.  During the school year, resource                         
              teachers will work with teachers in their classrooms, and                      
              meet with them during group meetings.  At these sessions                       
              teachers will be able to explore other science units and                       
              exchange experiences and ideas with their colleagues.                          
              The total cost sharing for the project will be 200% of the                     
              NSF portion.
