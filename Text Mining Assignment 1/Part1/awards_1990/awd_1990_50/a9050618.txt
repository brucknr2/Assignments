Abstract    :
                   A new laboratory course will be developed that will                       
              address the use of microcomputers in instrumentation,                          
              emphasizing the coupling between computers and                                 
              instrumentation.  The syllabus will cover the channels of                      
              communication between a microcomputer and instrumentation, a                   
              variety of interfaces, matching laboratory signals to                          
              interfaces and complete system design.  The new equipment will                 
              also be used to complement and upgrade the instrumentation                     
              available for current analog and digital electronics courses.
