Abstract    :
              Chemistry and physics students are introduced to modern spectroscopic          
              techniques involving lasers, and at the same time gain experience in           
              assembling modular, computer-controlled instrumentation.  Students             
              assemble modular instruments for experiments using such components             
              as a N2 laser, fiber optics, a boxcar/gated integrator, a scanning             
              monochrometer, a photomultiplier, an A/D converter, and an interfaced          
              MacintoshIIcx laboratory computer with Labview software.  The                  
              students learn the fundamentals of using a laboratory computer to              
              integrate and control instrumentation.  The grantee provides funds             
              for this project that are an equal match for the NSF award.
