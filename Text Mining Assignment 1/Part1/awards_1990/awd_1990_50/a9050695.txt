Abstract    :
              Instrumentation is being used to equip a new biochemistry laboratory to        
              provide students with a thorough understanding of fundamental                  
              principles and techniques. Instruments include a microcentrifuge for           
              sample preparation; gel electrophoresis units for the application of           
              both vertical and horizontal techniques; a shaker for gel treatments; a        
              transilluminator system for visualization of DNA; scanning UV-visible          
              spectrophotometers with a modular temperature controller and                   
              densitometer unit for characterization of biological molecules, assays         
              of enzymatic reactions, and quantitation of gels and autoradiograms; a         
              table top ultracentrifuge with rotors for demonstrations of the theory         
              and applications of centrifugation; refrigerator units; and a water            
              bath. Establishment of this laboratory increases the number of students        
              able to receive a comprehensive laboratory experience from zero to             
              twenty-four per year. The college will contribute an amount equal to           
              the award.
