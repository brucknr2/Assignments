Abstract    :
              The Natural Science and Mathematics Department is acquiring an                 
              integrated microscope/video camera system to significantly improve the         
              impact and range of topics that can be effectively prresented in the           
              biology curriculum. The microscopes are equipped with phase contrast           
              optics and are capable of interfacing with either the video camera or          
              with existing still cameras. One microscope is further equipped with           
              epifluorescence illumination; the other is equipped for Momarski               
              Differential Interference Contrast. This system permits the department         
              to more clearly present basic materials in the introductory courses for        
              majors and non-majors, allows the advanced courses to pursue more              
              sophisticated and relevant laboratory exercises, and provides advanced         
              students with greater opportunities for independent research.                  
              Furthermore, the equipment will enable the department to illustrate and        
              make available to education majors a very powerful tool for                    
              presentation, and to present short courses and workshops for the local         
              educational community on both content and pedagogic themes. The college        
              is contributing an amount equal to the award.
