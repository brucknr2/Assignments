Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Through this project, the Oregon Museum of Science and                    
              Industry will form a National Science and Technology Week                      
              (NSTW) Teacher Training and Materials Dissemination Network.                   
              The Network will utilize a series of training and orientation                  
              workshops for K-12 teachers throughout the nation to                           
              disseminate information and materials on the NSF-sponsored                     
              NTSW program and to create a cadre of NSTW ambassadors.  The                   
              workshops, which are to be coordinated with NSF's Teacher                      
              Enhancement Program, will serve almost 5000 teachers over the                  
              three year period. 530,000 students, including a significant                   
              number from underrepresented groups, will in turn be                           
              influenced by the project.  Cost sharing from the Corporate                    
              sponsors of NSTW in the amount of $150,000 is 86% of the NSF                   
              contribution to this project.
