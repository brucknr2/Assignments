Abstract    :
              Students can participate in modern plant ecology and physiology with           
              the use of new equipment including growth chambers, a portable                 
              photosynthesis measuring system, a portable leaf area meter, a                 
              datalogger, a portable chamber for measuring plant water stress, an            
              analytical balance, and electrophoresis equipment. A series of                 
              laboratory exercises have been developed to examine the effects of             
              environmental stress on plants. Exercises using the new equipment              
              include 1. laboratory and field studies on the effects of environmental        
              variation on plant growth, development and reproduction; 2. studies of         
              plant competition under controlled environmental conditions; and 3.            
              studies that examine levels of genetic variability in population and           
              measure the proportion of variation in multi-gene traits determined by         
              environmental or genetic factors.
