Abstract    :
              An interactive microcomputer laboratory is being established to                
              enhance instructional and research experiences for undergraduate               
              psychology majors. It impacts all majors as they work through a four-          
              year laboratory sequence which has been designed to build 1.                   
              cognitive skills involved in the logic of research design, 2.                  
              laboratory techniques to implement research designs, 3. data analytic          
              skills, 4. independence in the initiation and communication of                 
              research projects, and 5. identification with the profession as                
              scholar-scientists. Instruction is being provided in 1. interfacing            
              computers to control the presentation of stimuli for human and animal          
              experiments, 2. computer programming for environmental control, 3.             
              real-time data acquisition, and 4. interactive data analysis.                  
              Simulation programs are also used to introduce students to this                
              research strategy and to study phenomena which cannot otherwise be             
              investigated. The university will contribute an amount equal to the            
              award.
