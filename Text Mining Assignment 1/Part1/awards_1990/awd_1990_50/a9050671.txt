Abstract    :
              A computer laboratory is being established for instruction in and              
              experimentation with quantitative models in biological systems. The lab        
              is being furnished with 20 workstations, each equipped with a fast             
              processor and floating point co-processor, 4 megabytes of memory, color        
              graphics display, color printer, and mouse, networked to a                     
              server/supervisor workstation. The users of this lab are primarily             
              first and second year biology majors and students enrolled in the core         
              biology course. Students use software developoed by the P.I.s to carry         
              out experiments in genetics, population biology, and enzyme kinetics.          
              The software uses high-resolution graphics, sophisticated numerical            
              routines and a comfortable used interface. This project demonstrates           
              that computing equipment can supplement and enrich traditional                 
              laboratory approaches and permit early and effective introduction of           
              quantitative analysis in biology. The software will be distributed to a        
              wide audience. The university will contribute an amount equal to the           
              award.
