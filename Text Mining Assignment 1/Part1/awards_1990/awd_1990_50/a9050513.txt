Abstract    :
              The scientific foundation of undergraduate students majoring in                
              Communication Disorders is being enhanced by providing hands-on                
              laboratory experiences through the purchase of computer                        
              instrumentation. The use of MacSpeech Lab II with MacAdios II as a             
              computer processing tool for data acquisition, analysis, and display,          
              is the cornerstone of the project. The system is interfaced with               
              various transducers, enabling undergraduate students to investigate a          
              wide range of acoustic and physiologic parameters related to expressive        
              and receptive communication. The project includes development of two           
              laboratory manuals (Hearing and Speech Science) to facilitate                  
              experimental learning using the equipment. These manuals, as well as           
              the entire project, will provide directed hands-on experiences that            
              emphasize the fundamentals of research design, logic and critical              
              thinking skills. The university will contribute an amount equal to the         
              award.
