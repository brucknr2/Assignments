Abstract    :
              In undergraduate material courses, the lectures and textbooks                  
              emphasize qualitative and quantitative structural aspects of                   
              materials, while the laboratory portions concenrate on the more                
              macroscopic, quantitive properties.  It is imperative that students            
              understand that the macroscopic properties are a result of the                 
              microstructures, and that microstructural features can be                      
              quantitatively analyzed.                                                       
                                                                                             
              This project enhances the quantitative analysis of structures through          
              the addition of a computer-based analysis system.  An additional               
              benefit is that this system enables students to prepare better samples         
              in a reduced time period, thereby permitting more time for observation         
              and understanding.                                                             
                                                                                             
              The award is being matched with a greater amount (113 percent) by the          
              principal investigator's institution.
