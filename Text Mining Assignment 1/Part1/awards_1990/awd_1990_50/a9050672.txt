Abstract    :
              Students are learning calculus in a laboratory setting that allows             
              experimentation and discovery learning and focuses on concepts                 
              rather than manipulations.  The laboratory is equipped with IBM                
              PS/2 computers running Derive.                                                 
                                                                                             
              The institution will contribute an amount equal to the award.
