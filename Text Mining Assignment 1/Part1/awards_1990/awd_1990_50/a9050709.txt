Abstract    :
              The purpose of this project is to enhance the current status of                
              design courses in biomedical and mechanical engineering by                     
              providing new equipment and techniques in prototype design.  The               
              new equipment and concepts to be introduced include:  computer                 
              aided machining (CAM), computer controlled data acquisition, and               
              prototype development by device testing.  This system will enhance             
              the current design course curriculum by providing the means of                 
              implementing design changes.  By using this system students may                
              produce a prototype design, test the design, and make design                   
              changes by simply updating a computer file.  The successful                    
              execution of this project will result in abstract articles                     
              concerning the development of new techniques and laboratory manuals            
              to be made available to other institutions.  Students will benefit             
              by knowledge gained in using the new systems recently made                     
              commercially available, as well as through the additional amount               
              of practical design experience afforded by streamlining and                    
              automating the design process.  Most importantly, students will                
              learn to improve and reinforce their designs, a process that is not            
              currently practical without the automated equipment.
