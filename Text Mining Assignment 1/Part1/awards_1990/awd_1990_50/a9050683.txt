Abstract    :
              A local area network (LAN) of computer workstations serves the                 
              undergraduate programs in Natural Science and Engineering by allowing          
              a new approach to education that focuses on the technology of the              
              future.  The LAN facililty enables: 1) 'Hands-on' interactive methods,         
              2) tutorials or guidance for enrichment or acceleration, 3) extensive          
              undergraduate experience in state-of-the-art hardware and software,            
              4) individual student project applications.  The grantee provides              
              funds for this project that are an equal match for the NSF award.
