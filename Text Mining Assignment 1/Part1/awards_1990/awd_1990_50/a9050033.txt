Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The GMI Management & Engineering Institute has developed a human               
              network based in Michigan which includes major employers,                      
              university professors and administrators, associations of                      
              professional engineers, five city school districts (in primarily               
              minority dominated areas), organized labor, and community                      
              organizations.   The network is dedicated to the task of                       
              improving science and mathematics education in inner-city                      
              schools grades 7-12 by focussing on three related strategies.                  
                                                                                             
              The first strategy is directed to affecting culture changes                    
              within the participating inner-city school communities.                        
                                                                                             
              The second strategy is to assemble a team of outstanding                       
              instructors to deliver four innovative  courses via live,                      
              interactive satellite transmission.  Three of the courses are                  
              based on NSF sponsored projects:  MSU Middle Grades Mathematics                
              Project, Lawrence Hall-Foss Physical Science for Middle School,                
              and High School Algebra. The fourth course, high school physical               
              science, was developed by a science committee of the University                
              of Michigan faculty.                                                           
                                                                                             
              The third strategy is to establish a mentoring system between                  
              scientists and mathematicians and students and school teachers                 
              to enhance the course content and the teacher's knowledge and to               
              provide professional development opportunities for them.                       
                                                                                             
              The Detroit-based pilot project, which will run for six months,                
              includes ten schools (five high school, five middle schools) in                
              five school districts and involves 24 teachers and 1040                        
              students. Cost sharing in the amount of $466,500 is 300% of the                
              NSF contribution.
