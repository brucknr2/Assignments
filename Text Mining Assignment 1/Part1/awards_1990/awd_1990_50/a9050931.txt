Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Minority students graduating from Inner City high schools                      
              historically are computer illiterate, have little exposure to                  
              scientific instrumentation and generally very little interest in               
              science.  The objective of this project is to create a successful              
              high tech chemistry learning environment for the individual                    
              student that can be used as a model for other inner city                       
              chemistry students.                                                            
                                                                                             
              The equipment acquired by this project included 14 Apple IIGS                  
              microcomputer/Leap universal lab interface systems.  Since theses              
              systems are fully incorporated into specific laboratory studies,               
              students are able to utilize microcomputers throughout their                   
              chemistry courses.  In addition, these computers, when not used                
              in conjunction with the Leap interface, are used by students for               
              calculations, laboratory simulations, the writing of final                     
              laboratory reports, and the like.                                              
                                                                                             
              Each semester, the department encounters students with                         
              deficiencies in the following areas:  Decision Making, Computer                
              Literacy, Graphing, Computations, Writing (Lab Report),                        
              Understanding Basic Scientific Principles, and Analyzing Data.                 
              This project has provided inner city students with the                         
              opportunity and tools needed to overcome these deficiencies.                   
                                                                                             
              The institution has contributed to the project in an amount equal              
              to the NSF funds.
