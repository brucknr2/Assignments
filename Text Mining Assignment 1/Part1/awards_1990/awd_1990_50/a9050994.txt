Abstract    :
              The Siena College Physics Department is developing a clear                     
              curricular path that a student can follow to gain significant                  
              experience in an area of experimental physics.  The Department is              
              adding major equipment in four areas:  optical spectroscopy,                   
              holography, x rays and nuclear physics.  The new equipment is first            
              used in the sophomore labs.  A new junior-level laboratory course              
              in experimental physics is being developed to reinforce the gains              
              made in the sophomore labs by allowing students to continue to use             
              the equipment, but at a higher level.  Finally, when the students              
              reach the senior year and are required to carry out an independent             
              project, they have a solid base of skills and knowledge in one or              
              more experimental physics areas, which they can then pursue                    
              intensively.  Also, students performing research independent of the            
              required senior project have many more options from which to                   
              select.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              The college is matching the award with an equal amount of funds.
