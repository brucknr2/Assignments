Abstract    :
              The Biology Department is improving the quality of its undergraduate           
              education in the areas of physiology and microbiology through the              
              acquisition of several pieces of equipment. A microcomputer linked to a        
              microplate reader and a diode array spectrophotometer involve students         
              in interactive exercises across a variety of organ systems and                 
              metabolic processes. The microplate reader and accessories provide             
              students with exposure to diagnostic procedures including monitoring of        
              hormone levels, detection of infectious agents in situ and                     
              determination of levels of specific antibodies. The diode array                
              spectrophotometer allows students to perform kinetic studies on                
              enzymes, measure the oxidation-reduction spectrum of hemoglobin, and           
              determine the concentration of cytochromes in respiratory cells. The           
              combination of experience in these diagnostic and biochemical                  
              methodologies and computer simulations in the physiology and                   
              microbiology courses gives the students the necessary foundation to            
              excel in a variety of biological careers. The university will                  
              contribute an amount equal to the award.
