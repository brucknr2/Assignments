Abstract    :
              A classroom is equipped with workstations for twenty students and one          
              instructor thereby making possible three changes in the computer               
              science curriculum.  First, the courses for the computer science               
              major, particularly the first two courses, are taught in a more                
              interactive manner.  During two hour laboratory periods, students              
              work on structured assignments under the supervision of the                    
              instructor.  Second, the project provides for a standard operating             
              system, Unix, and a powerful and standard computing environment, X             
              Windows, that are used across the curriculum.  UNIX is a standard in           
              the academic world and previously students had only limited access             
              to it.  Third, the laboratory provides a central place where computer          
              science majors work on individual and joint software projects while            
              having access to considerable computing power and system                       
              documentation. Equipment acquired for this project includes powerful           
              desktop microcomputers supporting UNIX (Sun Microsystems SPARCstation          
              I) and "smart" terminals having a full implementation of the X Window          
              standard (Visual Technologies X19).  The twenty-one stations are               
              networked to take advantage of a central mass storage device and a             
              shared printer, which are also available to any other terminal on              
              campus through the college computing network.  The award is being              
              matched with a greater amount (102%) by the principal investigator's           
              institution.
