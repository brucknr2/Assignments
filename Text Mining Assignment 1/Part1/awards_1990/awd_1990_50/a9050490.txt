Abstract    :
              The lack of laboratory experiences in molecular genetics is being              
              remedied by developing a laboratory course in molecular biology                
              that is taken concurrently with the Molecular Biology lecture                  
              component.  Laboratory experiences include DNA extractions and                 
              plasmic isolations, DNA detection and quantitation methods,                    
              restriction enzyme digestions, ligations of restriction                        
              fragments, gene marker selection procedures, agarose gel                       
              electrophoresis, and DNA transfer and hybridization methods.  The              
              purchase of centrifuges and rotors, power supplies for                         
              electrophoresis experiments, fluorometers for DNA quantitation,                
              incubators and baths for enzyme reactions allow this laboratory                
              to be taught to biology majors and medical technology students.                
              The equipment is also used by students enrolled in honors program              
              research or independent study.  The university will contribute an              
              amount equal to the award.
