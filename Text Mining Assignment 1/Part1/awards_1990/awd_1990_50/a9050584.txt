Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry will acquire a CO2 laser, a UV-VIS                 
              spectrophotometer, a gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer and a                 
              graphics workstation for use in the undergraduate laboratories.                
              The focus of the project is an advanced elective,                              
              project-oriented laboratory to follow the required                             
              three-semester laboratory sequence for undergraduate chemistry                 
              majors at MIT.  Students enrolled in this course will                          
              concentrate on one or two specific topics from a menu of                       
              available choices; they will be expected to devise their own                   
              experimental protocols, prepare detailed proposals before                      
              starting laboratory work, and present their results in the form                
              of written reports and oral seminars, all under the guidance of                
              faculty mentors and experienced teaching assistants.  Projects                 
              are planned to appeal to a wide variety of student interests,                  
              including laser photochemistry and spectroscopy, protein                       
              chemistry, trace analysis of environmental contaminants,                       
              microelectrochemical devices, and advanced computational                       
              chemistry.  Provisions will be made for disseminating the                      
              results of these projects to other interested chemistry                        
              departments.
