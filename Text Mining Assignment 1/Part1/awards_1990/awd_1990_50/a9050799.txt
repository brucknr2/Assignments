Abstract    :
              This project seeks to improve the education of undergraduate                   
              industrial engineers in the effective management of productivity.              
              Productivity management encompasses the classical industrial                   
              engineering (IE) activities of work measurement, motion study, methods         
              improvement and work simplification, coupled with the consideration of         
              human factors.  As with most technical fields, improvement in the              
              practice of these IE basics can result from technological advances in          
              the equipment used.  No longer is it sufficient to arm an IE with              
              paper, pencil, and a stopwatch.  This project offers the IE student an         
              opportunity to gain experience with an array of today's sophisticated          
              tools, including automated data collection and analysis systems,               
              computer interfaces, and videotape technology.  These tools enhance the        
              IE's own productivity.  This experience combined with the underlying           
              theory of productivity management better prepares the student to               
              effectively manage productivity in the workplace.                              
                                                                                             
              The award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal               
              investigator's institution.
