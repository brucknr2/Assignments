Abstract    :
              The aim of this project is to enhance the undergraduate control                
              engineering curriculum in the Department of Electrical and                     
              Systems Engineering at Oakland University via modernization and                
              expansion of the current control engineering facilities.  The                  
              major laboratory equipment may be categorized as follows:  1) a                
              pneumatic and hydraulic hardware-in-the-loop computer-based                    
              control experiment system, 2) a diesel engine simulator-control                
              system, 3) two computer-aided control system design (CACSD)                    
              workstation with advanced graphics and software support, 4) two                
              microcomputer-based controller hardware development stations for               
              8/16/32-bit microprocessors and digital signal processors, and 5)              
              an electronic industrial sensors module.                                       
                                                                                             
              The equipment will be used to strengthen junior and senior                     
              offerings by introducing new laboratory experiments and projects               
              in specific courses.  A well-planned sequence of laboratory                    
              assignment involving analysis, design, simulation and                          
              experimentation will expose students to strong hands-on                        
              experience in an Integrated Computer Control Systems Engineering               
              Laboratory (ICCSEL) environment.  By incorporating the proposed                
              hardware-and simulator-in-the-loop systems, students will become               
              more familiar with applications, components, signal processing,                
              computer-aided design and tools, implementation, and computer                  
              hardware technology for control engineering.
