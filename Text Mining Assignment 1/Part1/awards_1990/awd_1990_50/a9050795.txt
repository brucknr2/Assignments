Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project was designed to introduce the use of the Fourier                  
              transform infrared technique into all levels of the chemistry                  
              program at the institution .  Through the project, a Fourier                   
              transform Infrared Spectrometer was purchased and is used for the              
              identification, analysis, kinetics, and the teaching of molecular              
              dynamics.   The system introduces students to the use of computer              
              integrated instrumentation, database searching, and computer-                  
              assisted data manipulation.  A number of new experiments have                  
              been included in junior and senior level laboratory courses.                   
              FTIR has improved the content of laboratory courses in General                 
              Chemistry as well as in Organic, Analytical, Physical, and                     
              Biochemistry.  It has made possible the integration of Physical                
              Chemistry with Instrumental Analysis.  In addition, it has                     
              complemented ongoing research projects and opened up new avenues               
              of research at time when the department was encouraging                        
              independent study by juniors and seniors.  The acquisition of the              
              instrumentation is helping the department meet its goals of                    
              requiring independent research for all undergraduate chemistry                 
              majors, and reaccreditation by the American Chemical Society.                  
                                                                                             
              The institution has contributed to the project in an amount equal              
              to the NSF funds.
