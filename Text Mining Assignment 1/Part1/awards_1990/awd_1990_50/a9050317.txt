Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This three-year project, entitled Watershed Worlds:Global                      
              Views/Regional Perspectives, uses the study of a watershed as a                
              way to look at the global environment. Using science and                       
              mathematics as information gathering tools, teachers and                       
              students in several watersheds throughout the country will be                  
              investigating the human impact on their regional environment.                  
              The program uses hands-on experiments utilizing state of-the-art               
              computer, scientific instrumentation and multimedia                            
              technologies. This project is sponsored by the Thames Science                  
              Center in New London, Connecticut where staff scientists,                      
              engineers and computer specialists will work with elementary,                  
              middle and high school teachers from throughout the country in a               
              five week summer workshop each year involving 15 teachers. The                 
              project will be developed and disseminated over the three year                 
              period and will involve 495 teachers and their students in grade               
              6-10 at 65 pilot sites throughout the nation. By the third year                
              of the project more that 1500 teachers will have been involved.                
              The first section of the Watershed Worlds' curriculum, Earth,                  
              Air and Water, examines chemical and physical phenomena                        
              including empirical studies on the relationships between air                   
              movements, precipitation volume and water chemistry. The three                 
              subsequent sections, In the Current, Still Waters and Changing                 
              Tides, focus on the applications of this knowledge through the                 
              study of specific habitats within a watershed. These sections                  
              cover identification, distribution and physiology of flora and                 
              fauna in these regions and show how they are influenced by the                 
              physical and chemical environment. The curriculum is enhanced by               
              investigatory kits which include sampling equipment supported by               
              a data base and a multimedia program which help to analyze the                 
              water quality and biodiversity of the watershed. The National                  
              Science Foundation is supporting the project in the amount of                  
              $615,736 which is being matched by $39,824 or about a 6% match.
