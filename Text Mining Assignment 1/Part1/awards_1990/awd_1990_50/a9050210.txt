Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              TERC will develop a comprehensive mathematics curriculum for grades K-6        
              based on investigations in number, data, and space, and emphasizing            
              depth and understanding.  The curriculum will stress mathematics as a          
              pattern-finding science, make the discipline more accessible to both           
              students and teachers, and build teachers' knowledge of how students           
              learn mathematics.                                                             
                                                                                             
              TERC will design, evaluate, and disseminate ten curriculum modules for         
              each grade level.  Each module will focus on a set of related and              
              developmentally appropriate investigations which introduce key                 
              mathematical content within a compelling context.  The teaching built          
              into the print materials (through scenarios depicting analytic work in         
              classrooms), and into videotapes of effective mathematics teaching in          
              action.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              Evaluation of the project will include formative research, as well as an       
              examination of the impact of the curriculum on students and teachers.          
              Investigations will be disseminated through publications aimed                 
              specifically at elementary school educators.  The curriculum will be           
              published by Dale Seymour Publications, who has made a major financial         
              commitment to the project.
