Abstract    :
              This proposal makes the nuclear physics laboratory of WKU more                 
              functional by augmenting the currently available equipment so that             
              (a) the nuclear physics laboratory is becoming a nuclear science               
              laboratory; (b) students are being taught not only principles, but             
              current methodology; and (c) undergraduate students are be involved            
              in meaningful, productive and publishable research.
