Abstract    :
              This project upgrades and expands the experimental component of                
              undergraduate education in the natural sciences.  The goal is to               
              improve the students' experimental expertise, to instruct them in the          
              use of state-of-the-art scientific instruments, and to aid data                
              acquisition and analysis in laboratories associated with formal                
              courses and in student independent research projects.  The                     
              instruments include those for chromatography, electrophoresis,, mass           
              spectrometry,, radioisotopes and data acquisition along with                   
              accessosry equipment related to these instruments.  These instruments          
              extends the range of investigations conducted to include                       
              environmental physiology and ecology, measurement of toxicants in the          
              environment, and separation of biologically significant molecules and          
              cellular organelles.  The grantee provides funds for this project              
              that are an equal match for the NSF award.
