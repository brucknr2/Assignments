Abstract    :
              This project employs microcomputer based data acquisition and control          
              workstations for instruction in undergraduate engineering technology           
              heat transfer and fluid mechanics laboratories.  Each workstation              
              consists of a microcomputer, printer/plotter, oscilloscope, and                
              interface cards to be integrated with existing experimental apparatus.         
              This equipment enables innovative approaches to laboratory instructions        
              and offers students "hands-on" experience with modern instrumentation.         
                                                                                             
              The award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal               
              investigator's institution.
