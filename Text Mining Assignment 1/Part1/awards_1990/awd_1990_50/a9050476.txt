Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to the departments of Chemistry and                  
              Biochemistry which will help purchase equipment that will expose               
              the undergraduate students taking biochemistry to laboratory                   
              exercises which will include computer-aided instruction of                     
              recombinant DNA techniques.  A cohesive series of laboratory                   
              experiments will be developed which will provide a student with                
              practical exposure to a) the fundamental techniques in recombinant             
              DNA research, b) the fundamental techniques of protein chemistry               
              and c) the use of computers as an integral part of biochemical                 
              experimentation through the in-depth exploration of a single                   
              biological system.  The grantee is matching this award with non-               
              Federal sources.
