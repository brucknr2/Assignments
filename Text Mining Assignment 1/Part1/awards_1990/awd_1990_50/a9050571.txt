Abstract    :
              Students are using a new laboratory equipped with Macintosh IIcx               
              and Everex 3000 computers in sophomore level courses required of               
              mathematics majors.  The computer experience in a team project                 
              setting is providing valuable training for majors and is expected              
              to attract more able and inquisitive students into mathematics.                
              The institution will contribute an amount equal to the award.//
