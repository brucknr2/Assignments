              Indiana University will establish a comprehensive program for                  
              training elementary teachers in science which will include                     
              the following activities:  (1) revision of introductory                        
              science courses to emphasize conceptual understanding and the                  
              application of computer technology; (2) the establishment of                   
              a "science specialist" curriculum;  (3) the development of an                  
              interdisciplinary science capstone course for the science                      
              specialists;  (4) the creation of a special science methods                    
              course for the science specialists emphasizing computer                        
              technology and new teaching approaches such as group                           
              learning, the learning cycle, constructivism, and science                      
              misconceptions;  (5) the establishment of a program of                         
              Saturday Science Experiences for elementary children in the                    
              community;  (6) the development of computer-assisted lessons                   
              on mathematical concepts in science; (7) training a network                    
              of mentor teachers in the local community through a series of                  
              summer workshops; and (7) an inservice program for all                         
              elementary teachers in the local school system.   The cost-                    
              sharing by the University and the local school system is                       
              $342,254, which is 27% of NSF's contribution.
