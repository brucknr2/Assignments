Abstract    :
              An Image Processing Instructional Laboratory to be used for a new              
              senior course, Image Processing & Transmission, as well as for                 
              undergraduate compression, analysis, segmentation, and                         
              applications established.                                                      
                                                                                             
              A comprehensive undergraduate course on image processing with a                
              well integrated laboratory component will benefit undergraduate                
              students majoring in the electrical engineering as well as in                  
              other engineering and scientific disciplines.  Such a course is                
              not widely available.  The requested equipment consists of four                
              diskless workstations, each with color monitor, and a file                     
              server, with supporting peripheral equipment for hardcopy output               
              and network interfacing.  Software packages for this equipment                 
              will be obtained from public domain sources as well as from                    
              specific industrial laboratory sources.  Black and white color                 
              image data, both still and motion sequences, is already                        
              available, and more will be acquired from outside sources.
