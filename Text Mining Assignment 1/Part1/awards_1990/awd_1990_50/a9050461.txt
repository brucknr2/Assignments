Abstract    :
              New equipment is improving the student learning experience in                  
              physiology-oriented laboratory sections in a number of biology                 
              courses, by providing the opportunity to experiment in areas of                
              contemporary biology.  Equipment that is "user friendly" and                   
              provides rapid set-up and response time permits new experiments                
              to be performed in limited time constraints.  A refrigerated                   
              centrifuge and oxygen monitoring system provide for experiments                
              on the photosynthetic response of isolated chloroplasts and the                
              respiratory response of isolated mitochondria, ranging from basic              
              analyses in introductory courses to more advanced studies in                   
              plant physiology and biochemistry.  The oxygen monitoring system               
              also allows for the exploration of the respiratory response of                 
              aquatic invertebrates and microorganisms as a bioassay in a                    
              variety of experiments in ecology and microbiology courses.  The               
              equipment is used in a large variety of applications in different              
              courses, and affects many students.  The equipment also allows                 
              students to do more experimentation in independent research                    
              projects.  The college will contribute an amount equal to the                  
              award.
