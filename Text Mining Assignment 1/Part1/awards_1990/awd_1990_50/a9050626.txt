Abstract    :
              A laboratory course, "Properties of Engineering Materials,"  has               
              been developed for mechanical engineers.  The goals of the new                 
              course are:                                                                    
              (1) To show the effects of structure and mechanical processing on              
                  material properties,                                                       
              (2) To show the differences between the behavior of metals,                    
                  polymers and composites,                                                   
              (3) To become familiar with standard experimental techniques, and              
              (4) To show the importance of these effects and differences in                 
                  design and manufacturing.                                                  
                   The equipment required for this project includes an impact                
              machine and a computer controlled tensile machine suitable for                 
              testing ductile polymers and elastomers.  These make possible                  
              the study of new polymer and composite materials, especially the               
              internal damping and creep behavior that occurs at room                        
              temperature.  Also the effects of material processing on mechanical            
              properties can be investigated.  The award is being matched by an              
              equal amount from the principal investigator's institution.
