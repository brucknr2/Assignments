Abstract    :
              The aim of this project is to improve fundamental science                      
              instruction in the area of cell and molecular biology by acquiring             
              state-of-the-art instrumentation and expanding the scope of                    
              laboratory exercises in several courses. The major instruments                 
              being acquired include laminar flow hoods, and HPLC system,                    
              electrophoretic equipment, and scintillation counter, a water                  
              purification/deionization system and environmental chambers. The               
              equipment allows examination of cellular phenomena in greater depth            
              in the course laboratory exercises and fosters enhancement of                  
              student research projects to yield data that may be presented at               
              meetings or published. The project provides a greatly improved                 
              learning experience for the students who are preparing for graduate            
              school, professional school, or the workforce. By using state-of-              
              the art equipment, they are better prepared to interact with                   
              today's technology. The university is contributing an amount equal             
              to the award.
