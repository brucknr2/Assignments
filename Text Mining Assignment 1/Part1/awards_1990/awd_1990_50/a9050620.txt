Abstract    :
              The rapid growth of computerized technology related to design has              
              generated tremendous pressure on both the industrial and academic              
              communities.  Industry has need for engineers prepared to meet the             
              challenges of this new workplace environment.  Colleges and                    
              universities must find ways to incorporate these experiences into              
              the various aspects of the undergraduate curriculum.  To this end              
              this project enhances the current CAD laboratory with state-of-                
              the-art technology at the lowest possible cost.  The essential                 
              equipment and software provide students with learning opportunities            
              in the areas of (a) solid modeling, (b) 3-D surfaces, (c) 2-D/3-               
              D drafting, and (d) finite element modeling and analysis.  This                
              environment permits the development of the requisite skills and                
              results in graduates suited to career needs.  The award is being               
              matched by an equal amount from the principal investigator's                   
              institution.***//
