Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Education Development Center, in conjunction with the Urban                    
              Mathematics Collaborative and Sunburst Corporations, is                        
              requesting funding for a conference to plan "Teaching and                      
              Schooling for a New Vision of Secondary Mathematics."  The                     
              Geometric Supposer software will serve as a focus and exemplar                 
              for developing the conference themes.  The conference will                     
              bring together representatives of the school restructuring                     
              movement, a range of secondary school mathematics educators,                   
              and mathematicians.  The conference will address questions                     
              related to:  the defining characteristics of a new vision of                   
              secondary mathematics instruction as exemplified by the use                    
              of the Supposers:  the new roles and responsibilities required                 
              of teachers by these approaches: and the place of these                        
              experiences and approaches within the school restructuring                     
              movement.  Recommendations for continued activity by                           
              participants will be the major conference outcome, and will                    
              be disseminated through a variety of vehicles.                                 
                                                                                             
              Cost-sharing is provided as 100% of the NSF award.
