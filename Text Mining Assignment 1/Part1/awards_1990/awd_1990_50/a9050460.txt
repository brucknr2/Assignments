Abstract    :
              The Physics Department at Indiana University of Pennsylvania is                
              constructing a set of experiments around a semiconductor                       
              characterization workstation, consisting of a variable-temperature             
              cryostat, a capacitance-voltage (C-V) measurement system, a current-           
              voltage (I-V) measurement system, and a deep level transient                   
              spectroscopy system (DLTS).  The workstation is being used in the              
              senior solid state electronics laboratory to allow students to                 
              explore the properties of semiconducting materials.  In addition, it           
              is being used in undergraduate research projects. The University is            
              matching the award with an equal amount of funds.
