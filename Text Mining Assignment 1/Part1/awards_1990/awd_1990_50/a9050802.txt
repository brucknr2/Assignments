Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              Through this project, the institution acquired a high field                    
              Fourier Transform Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectrometer capable              
              of rapid determination of (1)H and (13)C NMR spectra.  The                     
              instrument also permits use of most of the newest techniques such              
              as COSY, NOESY and HETCOR for the determination of                             
              structure.  The equipment is used in seven undergraduate courses               
              covering biochemistry, organic, inorganic and physical chemistry.              
              It is utilized for undergraduate research, and for a new                       
              laboratory course in polymer chemistry.  Sophomores, juniors and               
              seniors study the structure and stereochemical features of a                   
              variety of compounds including materials of biochemical interest.              
                                                                                             
              The NMR spectrometer provided a dual benefit by significantly                  
              improving course offerings and updating instrument holdings.                   
                                                                                             
              The institution contributed to the project in an amount $15,000                
              over the NSF award.
