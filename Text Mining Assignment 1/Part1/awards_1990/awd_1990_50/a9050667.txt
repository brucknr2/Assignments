Abstract    :
              This project involves the development of an undergraduate Laboratory           
              integrating computer vision with robot task planning.  Further,                
              applications involving low-level electronics interfacing are studied by        
              students of applied physics.  One aim of the laboratory is to provide          
              experiences for Computer Science students that will enable them to             
              understand, implement, and clearly see the applications of artificial          
              intelligence techniques in a physical world situation.  Major                  
              instruments in this project include 1) cameras and image processing            
              computers for the vision component, 2) robot manipulators and                  
              controlling computers for the machine intelligence component, and 3) a         
              local area network to integrate vision with robotics and to allow data         
              transfer among all components.  The project is significant in that it          
              eliminates a curriculum deficiency by providing laboratory experiences         
              for undergraduates in the areas of computer vision, machine                    
              intelligence, and electronics interfacing.  These serve both for               
              instruction and for instilling enthusiasm for continued work at the            
              graduate level.                                                                
                                                                                             
              The award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal               
              investigator's institution.
