Abstract    :
              The addition of a HPLC to the instrumentation available to                     
              undergraduate students allow students to make measurements and                 
              use instrumentation expected of professionals in Chemistry,                    
              Chemical Engineering, and Environmental Science.  The grantee                  
              provides funds for this project that are an equal match for the                
              NSF award.
