Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Chemistry Department acquired a Fourier Transform Infrared                 
              spectrometer to implement a plan for curriculum reform that                    
              encourages students to integrate diverse perspectives within the               
              discipline of chemistry.  The spectrometer is used in a three-                 
              semester advanced laboratory sequence that combines laboratories               
              from instrumental analysis, advanced organic chemistry and                     
              physical chemistry.  The spectrometer is also used in a recently               
              revised microscale organic chemistry, an instrumental analysis                 
              course for non-majors, and senior student research projects.  In               
              addition the Chemistry Department offers a workshop on Analytical              
              Instrumentation for area high school teachers that includes FTIR               
              spectroscopy.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              The institution contributed to this project in an amount equal to              
              the NSF funds.
