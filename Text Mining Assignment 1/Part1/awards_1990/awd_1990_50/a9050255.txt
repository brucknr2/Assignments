Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project, Masters II:  Math and Science Teachers for                       
              Reservations Schools II, is a renewal of a previously funded                   
              program which will serve 117 teachers of Native American                       
              children in grades K-9.  Teachers will be selected from the                    
              entire United States, but especially from the sixteen states                   
              with schools serving predominantly Native American students.                   
              Each year, thirty five teachers from public and Bureau of                      
              Indian Affairs (BIA) schools will participate in intensive                     
              eight-week workshops to improve their mathematics and science                  
              content and pedagogy.  Six of these teachers will be selected                  
              to participate for a second and third year eight-week workshop                 
              during the two subsequent summers.  These selected teachers                    
              will mentor new participants, develop their leadership skills                  
              and work closely with agency and education personnel to effect                 
              change in their own local school districts. This project design                
              of building leaders through their three-year involvement holds                 
              real promise for effecting change.                                             
                                                                                             
              Curriculum materials, especially adapted for their                             
              effectiveness with Native American students, will be used                      
              extensively.  An existing BIA funded electronic network, ENAN,                 
              will facilitate the networking so important for teachers who                   
              are spread across the country.                                                 
                                                                                             
              The University of Kansas, Haskell Indian Junior College and                    
              participating school districts as well as the BIA are cost-                    
              sharing this program.  The bulk of the cost-share is coming                    
              from the Bureau of Indian Affairs in an amount twice that of                   
              the NSF request.  This funding supports programs that are                      
              integrated with the MASTERS project as well as those that                      
              precede it and support it.
