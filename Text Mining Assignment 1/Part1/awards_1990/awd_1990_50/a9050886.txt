Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to support microcomputer-based                       
              instrumentation to modernize the introductory human physiology                 
              laboratory program at San Diego State University.  The specific                
              equipment includes microcomputer stations equipped with general                
              purpose analog input/output laboratory interfaces and appropriate              
              commercial software for data acquisition and reduction.  The                   
              equipment will be used for acquisition and display of data in on-              
              line experiments, for interactive graphics simulations of processes            
              which are difficult or impossible to implement in the laboratory,              
              for reduction and analysis of data previously acquired or provided             
              by the instructor, and for software tutorials and instructional                
              supplements dealing with the laboratory experiments and related                
              lecture materials.  This project provides several enhancements to              
              the conventional introductory physiology laboratory experience:                
              (1) student focus can be shifted away from monitoring the recording            
              equipment and analyzing manually plotted data, toward a greater                
              understanding of the physiological process under investigation, by             
              utilizing  modern data acquisition and reduction methods; (2)                  
              interactive animated color graphics simulations offer a self-paced,            
              interactive alternative to conventional laboratory courses, or the             
              need for use of live animals and potentially dangerous reagents;               
              and (3) student comprehension of concepts and principles difficult             
              or impossible to observe directly at the laboratory bench can be               
              enhanced.
