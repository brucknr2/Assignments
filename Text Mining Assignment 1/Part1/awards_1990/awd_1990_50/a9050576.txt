Abstract    :
              Funds are being used to purchase a high quality microscope with                
              bright-field, fluorescent, and photographic capabilities. This                 
              instrument is to be the focus of lab exercises in the introductory             
              genetics course, a cytogenetics course, and an immunology course.              
              It is to be used to a lesser degree in bacteriology, embryology,               
              and histology courses, and will also be used in independent                    
              research projects. In the genetics courses, attention is focused               
              on chromosomes. Several laboratory exercises and student research              
              projects have been designed to involve students in cytogenetics and            
              immunological techniques which require photo- and fluorescent                  
              microscopy. This provides students, many of whom are members of                
              minority groups, with technical knowledge and expertise in the use             
              of an instrument fundamental to biological investigations.                     
              The university will contribute an amount equal to the award.
