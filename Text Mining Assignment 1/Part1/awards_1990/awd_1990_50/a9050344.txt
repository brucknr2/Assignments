Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This three-year project, sponsored by Howard University,                       
              provides for an effective two-year in-service teacher                          
              training program followed by an evaluation and follow-up in                    
              the third year.  The project will involve 60 middle school                     
              mathematics teachers in grades 7-8 in eleven middle schools                    
              in the D.C. public school system.  Teachers will be selected                   
              from those schools where the students' standardized test                       
              performances fall below the grade level average of the                         
              Washington D.C. area.  The project involves professional                       
              staffs from Howard University, the  American Association for                   
              the Advancement of Science, the Alliance Computer Systems                      
              Corporation, the University of the District of Columbia, the                   
              D.C. Public School Systems and the Washington Urban League.                    
              The principal activities in this teacher program will include                  
              the following:  hands-on training with materials evaluated                     
              and approved by the National Council of Teachers in                            
              Mathematics (NCTM), as well as materials from the Middle                       
              Grade Mathematics Project, the Lawrence Hall of Science and                    
              AAAS; intensive workshops in basic mathematics (algebra,                       
              geometry and statistics); simulation and graphics experience                   
              using supercomputers and sophisticated workstations; use of                    
              college student assistance during the academic school year in                  
              the teachers' classrooms; supervises teaching experience with                  
              experts in various fields of mathematics who will also be                      
              serving as collaborators; workshops with parents and                           
              administrators in the schools; provisions of day-care                          
              facilities for teachers with dependent children during the                     
              summer workshop; and extensive evaluation not only of the                      
              program but of student achievement.  The NSF share of the                      
              cost of the project is $626,322 which is being matched by                      
              $336,000 from Howard University, the District of Columbia                      
              Public Schools and local business and industry.  This is a                     
              match of about 54%.
