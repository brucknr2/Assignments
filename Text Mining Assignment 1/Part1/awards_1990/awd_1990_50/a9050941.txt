Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The focus of this advanced undergraduate laboratory is the                     
              fabrication and characterization of thin films.  It is intended                
              to provide an introduction to modern scientific instrumentation                
              typically used in contemporary experiments.  The project makes                 
              use of a scanning electron microscope, Van de Graaf accelerator,               
              and an x-ray diffractometer, thin film deposition system, optical              
              ellipsometer, and data acquisition systems.  This course is                    
              intended to serve as a model for recruiting gifted undergraduates              
              into graduate study in physics and engineering.
