Abstract    :
              A computer laboratory for experimental psychology is being                     
              developed in which students enrolled in Experimental Psychology                
              engage in the following sequential steps: 1. the student serves                
              as a subject in several classical studies in psychophysics,                    
              learning and cognition; 2. the student develops and programs                   
              variations of these studies; 3. the student reviews the                        
              literature in an area of interest and develops and programs an                 
              original experiment; 4. the student collects and analyzes data                 
              and interprets findings in journal-style papers; and 5. the                    
              student is encouraged to report his or her findings at regional                
              or national conferences in experimental psychology. The impact of              
              this laboratory will be felt by all students who take psychology               
              courses, especially those in Experimental Psychology, Cognitive                
              Psychology, and Research Methods in the Behavioral Sciences. The               
              college will contribute an amount equal to the award.
