Abstract    :
              The physics department is equipping introductory physics laboratories          
              with microcomputer data acquisition and analysis equipment at each             
              lab station.  The goal is to enhance the experimental component of             
              the introductory courses by increasing the diversity of phenomena              
              which can be studied, improving the efficiency with which data can             
              be taken, and allowing the instructor to tailor the teaching of a              
              particular experiment to the level of the students involved.  At the           
              lowest level, software written by the instructor guides the students'          
              interaction with the experiment.  At a higher level, students write            
              portions of the software needed to control the experiment.  This               
              exposure to computer interfacing prepares the students for their               
              advanced laboratory experiences in which similar equipment and                 
              techniques are used.  The equipment includes sixteen digital                   
              mulitmeters with IEEE-488 interfaces and sixteen MS-DOS compatible             
              personal computers with IEEE-488 digital input/output, analog-to-              
              digital input and digital-to-analog output interfaces.  All computers          
              are connected in a Local Area Network, run by a single file server             
              equipped with a fast, high-capacity hard drive.  Software is being             
              written in standard, high-level programming languages.  The college            
              is matching the award with an equal amount of funds.
