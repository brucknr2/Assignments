Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to help purchase equipment which will                
              improve the education of undergraduate students, both majors and               
              non-majors, at the University of Washington in organismic biology,             
              with primary emphasis on courses focusing on the biology of marine             
              invertebrates.  The specific equipment requested is a modern video             
              microscopy system, including mobile workstation with two compound              
              and stereo microscopes, high resolution solid-state cameras,                   
              instructor and classroom color monitors, and video cassette                    
              recorder.  This equipment will permit all students in the                      
              laboratory to participate simultaneously and interactively in the              
              same microscopy exercises and to address particular problems by                
              live video presentations.  It will also permit storage and recall              
              of images including those of phenomena that can only rarely be                 
              captured.  The grantee is matching this award with non-Federal                 
              sources.
