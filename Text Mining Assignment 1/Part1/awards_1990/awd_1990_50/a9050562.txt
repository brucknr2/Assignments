Abstract    :
              Students are working on real-world projects provided by local                  
              industry.  The students are learning the appropriate mathematical              
              tools and how to implement them on microcomputers in a computer                
              laboratory equipped with Macintosh computers and a variety of                  
              software packages.  The curriculum for mathematics and science                 
              students and prospective teachers is being enriched by these                   
              projects.  The institution will contribute an amount equal to the              
              award.//
