Abstract    :
              Molecular genetics is being introduced into the laboratory component of        
              the undergraduate course in Genetics. Acquisition of new equipment,            
              including a high speed centrifuge, rotors, analytical balance, freezer,        
              incubator, spectrophotometer, sterilizer, shaker, and transilluminator,        
              alleviates a major deficiency in the curriculum. As a result of these          
              improvements, students will increase their reasoning skills and their          
              understanding of modern biotechnology. This should have a major impact         
              on this Historically Black College. The college is contributing an             
              amount equal to the award.
