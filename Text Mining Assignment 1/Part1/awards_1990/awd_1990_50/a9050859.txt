Abstract    :
              Modern optics is the basis for some of the most innovative                     
              applications in today's technology.  Lasers and modern optics have             
              also had a major impact on the experimental work in the physical               
              sciences.  Yet this field has received very little attention in                
              most college physics curricula.  While some physics departments                
              have tried to reverse this trend in either their courses for the               
              majors or for the non-majors, few have attempted to incude this                
              field in a connected and comprehensive manner in their                         
              undergraduate curriculum.  Union is introducing experimental modern            
              optics and lasers at several stages of the physics curriculum both             
              to educate a wider audience, and to provide a stronger background              
              for those who would pursue this field at a more advanced level.                
              They are using high-quality optical components, lasers, detectors,             
              and analysers for advanced experiments, and also in laboratories               
              for non-science majors.  In addition, they are involving students              
              from other sciences and, especially, engineering in the work.  The             
              college is matching the award with an equal amont of funds.
