Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The University of Minnesota will conduct "Research                             
              Explorations for Teachers," a program for 50 secondary                         
              teachers from Minnesota to join University faculty research                    
              teams.  Research projects are in areas such as: ecology and                    
              behavioral biology, microbiology, geology, neurology, human                    
              genetics, soil science, archaeology, anthropology, etc. Most                   
              projects will take place in Minnesota; some, abroad.  In                       
              addition to participating in the research projects of their                    
              choice, teachers will attend three seminars conducted by                       
              University faculty that will focus on the use of research in                   
              classrooms, recent trends in scientific research, active                       
              learning styles, and curriculum development.  Teachers will                    
              receive both financial support and instructional assistance                    
              for developing curricular materials related to the content                     
              and inquiry-based approach of their research experiences.                      
              Curricular material resulting from these projects will be                      
              distributed in at least three ways: (l) at meetings of the                     
              Minnesota Science Teachers and the Minnesota Council of                        
              Social Studies Teachers; (2) through the publication and                       
              distribution to district curriculum specialists of the best                    
              materials created by teachers in this program; and (3) at                      
              in-service days of participating school districts.                             
                                                                                             
              An amount equivalent to 18.7% of the NSF award is being                        
              contributed as cost-sharing.
