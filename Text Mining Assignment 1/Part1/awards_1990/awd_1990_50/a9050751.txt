Abstract    :
                   This project will support the purchase of equipment which                 
              will enable instructors of undergraduate mathematics courses to                
              integrate computer demonstrations into their lectures.  It is                  
              being funded under the Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement              
              (ILI) Program, which has the goal of supporting projects to                    
              develop new or improved instrument-based undergraduate laboratory              
              courses in science, mathematics, or engineering.  The                          
              Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement Program provides                    
              matching support for the instrumentation necessary to implement                
              undergraduate instructional improvements at U.S. colleges and                  
              universities.                                                                  
                   In particular, the main objective of this project is to                   
              enable instructors to show more realistic examples and                         
              demonstrate the use of the programs and languages they expect                  
              their students to use.  The part of the curriculum targeted for                
              improvement in this project is a group of courses with an                      
              applications emphasis designed for science and engineering                     
              majors.  The courses to be affected include differential                       
              equations, Fourier analysis, linear algebra, numerical analysis,               
              linear programming, combinatorics, and number theory.
