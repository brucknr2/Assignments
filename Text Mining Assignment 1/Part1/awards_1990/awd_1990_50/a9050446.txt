Abstract    :
              This project automates the Advanced Network and Control Systems                
              Analysis Laboratory through the acquisition of computer                        
              controlled instrumentation.  This permits the automation of data               
              collection, provides hardcopy records of results, and permits                  
              data analysis on the host controller.  The use of bus-controlled               
              instruments eliminates repetitive set-ups, improves data quality,              
              reduces data collection time and enhances analysis reporting.                  
              Students have additional time to explore more facets of a given                
              experiment while the quality and uniformity of results is                      
              improved.  The availability of the host controller with stored                 
              data allows the students to perform data analysis beyond previous              
              levels.  The equipment is also used for demonstrations in lower                
              division courses, teaching the techniques of bus-controlled                    
              instrumentation, and for applications in senior projects.                      
                                                                                             
              The award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal               
              investigator's institution.
