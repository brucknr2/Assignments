Abstract    :
              The Psychology Department of Wittenberg University has recently                
              revised its curriculum, the most significant change being the                  
              institution of laboratory courses for upper division students. The             
              department is purchasing equipment (Human Physiology Recording Package)        
              that allows enhancement of the laboratory in Physiological Psychology,         
              improves lectures in lower division courses, and increases                     
              opportunities for independent research by advanced undergraduate               
              students. Laboratory exercises involving human subjects are being              
              incorporated to introduce important psychophysiological principles to          
              the students. The physiological polygraphic recording systems can              
              display brain, muscle, heart, and skin resistance activity and allow           
              students to analyze analog data. The compact portable design of the            
              systems allows them to be used in demonstrations for lower level               
              courses and for research by advanced students. Thus, students at all           
              levels learn about the interrelationship between human physiology and          
              psychology. The university will contribute an amount equal to the              
              award.
