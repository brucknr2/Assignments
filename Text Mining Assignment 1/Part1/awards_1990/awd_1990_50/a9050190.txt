Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The uniqueness of this program lies in a collaboration among a major           
              publisher of school science materials (D.C. Heath & Co.), nationally           
              known scientists and science educators, federal agencies (National             
              Aeronautics & Space Administration, Federal Aviation Administration,           
              National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the Civil Air             
              Patrol), the University of Colorado, and the U.S. Space Foundation.  The       
              result will be a complete basal instructional materials program for            
              grades 6,7, and 8.  It will feature:                                           
                                                                                             
                   o   hands-on, inquiry-based activities;                                   
                   o   use of space and aviation technologies to motivate students to        
                       study the life, earth, and physical sciences;                         
                   o   activities centered on concrete representations of abstract           
                       scientific concepts;                                                  
                   o   a focus on cooperative learning strategies;                           
                   o   approaches that encourage gender equity and the participation         
                       of minorities and the disabled.
