Abstract    :
              Students in college algebra, trigonometry, and calculus are                    
              experimenting with a new computerized learning environment based               
              on a software package called MATHPERT, which is running on                     
              computers using the MS-DOS operating system.  The system guides and            
              helps students produce solutions to problems and decides how much              
              help is needed based on the student's previous performance.  The               
              institution will contribute an amount equal to the award.//
