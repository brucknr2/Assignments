Abstract    :
              Students in calculus and precalculus are concentrating on problem              
              solving and the understanding of concepts.  These activities are               
              enhanced by the use of a computer laboratory equipped with IBM PS/2            
              computers running Derive.  Students studying geometry and                      
              statistics will use the laboratory in the future.  The institution             
              will contribute an amount equal to the award.//
