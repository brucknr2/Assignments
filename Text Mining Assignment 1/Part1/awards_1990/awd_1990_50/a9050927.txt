Abstract    :
              Chemistry and Geology are two scientific fields that require                   
              sophisticated, expensive instrumentation to obtain scientific facts.           
              The x-ray powder diffractometer is one such instrument.  A modern              
              instrument includes significant data acquisition and data processing           
              capability and is able to provide measurements that could not be done          
              satisfactorily with earlier generations of these instruments.  The             
              modern instruments are more readily used in undergraduate courses and          
              provide the results in significantly less time.  The grantee provides          
              funds for this project that are an equal match for the NSF award.
