Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The laboratory course in instrumental analysis in the                          
              contemporary chemistry curriculum suffers from a tension between               
              the teaching of the functional details of instruments versus the               
              overall process of chemical analysis.  Analytical chemistry as                 
              practiced in industry and elsewhere requires an understanding of               
              the overall process.  This project addresses that need by the                  
              incorporation of an analytical method development project into                 
              the laboratory.  Students choose one inorganic (mineral) and                   
              organic (i.e. vitamin) component of a processed food product such              
              as infant milk formula or fortified cereal to analyze.  They                   
              research analytical methods in the chemical literature, exercise               
              critical evaluation in choosing methods, and develop independent               
              thinking as the analyses are carried out.  The High Performance                
              Liquid Chromatograph acquired through this project is crucial to               
              the success of many of the organic analyses that students                      
              encounter in the exercises.                                                    
                                                                                             
              The institution contributed to the project in an amount equal to               
              the NSF funds.
