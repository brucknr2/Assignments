Abstract    :
              This project enhances the computer science curriculum through the              
              introduction of an undergraduate concentration in parallel computing.          
              The purchase of parallel processing hardware permits the implementation        
              of laboratory experiences in the parallel computing courses, enables           
              larger seminar projects and facilitates independent study.  The key            
              equipment consists of a 64 processor, parallel machine, a PARACOM              
              Multicluster, based on the INMOS T800 Transputer.  The 64 nodes of this        
              system can be partitioned into sub-clusters and allocated to as many as        
              4 different users, simultaneously.  Each user is able to request               
              allocation and to configure it by selecting a wide range of connection         
              topologies.  The system can also be treated as a single 64 processor           
              supercomputer.  All of these options are under software control, and           
              the Multicluster is accessible from the existing undergraduate network         
              of Sun Microsystems workstations.  The equipment can be expanded as the        
              demand for parallel processing grows.                                          
                                                                                             
              The award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal               
              investigator's institution.
