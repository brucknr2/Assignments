Abstract    :
              Students are using the graphical, numerical and symbolic                       
              capabilities of Mathematica, running on Macintosh IIcx computers,              
              to analyze problems and solve sequences of problems which are                  
              designed to lead them to experiment, search for patterns, and make             
              conjectures.  The institution will contribute an amount equal to               
              the award.//
