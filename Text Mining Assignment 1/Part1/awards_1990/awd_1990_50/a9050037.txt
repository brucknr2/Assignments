Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The proposal requests a supplementary grant to conduct                    
              follow-up work which would expand the findings of an NSF                       
              project currently being conducted by the principal                             
              investigator. The purpose of the project is to examine an                      
              important transition phase in the careers of future women                      
              scientists and engineers--the immediate postdoctoral period,                   
              during which a serious differential in participation in S&E                    
              occurs. The study includes the entire population of women                      
              whom received postdoctoral fellowships from NSF and NRC.                       
              Quantitative and qualitative data, obtained through standard                   
              survey and analysis methods, are used to provide a fuller                      
              description of the existing barriers, and to formulate and                     
              test hypotheses that can help guide policy for the reduction                   
              of these barriers. The purpose of the supplementary grant                      
              request is to conduct indepth, face-to-face interviews and                     
              administer a follow-up questionnaire, as important parts of                    
              the total project.
