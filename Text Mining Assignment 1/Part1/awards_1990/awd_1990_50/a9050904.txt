Abstract    :
              The department is creating a fully equipped classroom/laboratory to            
              teach Demography to relatively large undergraduate classes. To be              
              truly effective, lectures must be followed by "hands on" laboratory            
              experiences. The state of computer and software development makes              
              such an experience technically feasible in the field of demography.            
              Recent developments in the Macintosh environment, to which the                 
              department has committed its computer development, are promising. The          
              faculty have been actively involved in developing computer                     
              applications for instruction, but have been previously limited by the          
              lack of facilities to implement that instruction outside of courses,           
              except for a very few students. This facility is helping the                   
              department to broaden the audience. The university will contribute             
              an amount equal to the award.
