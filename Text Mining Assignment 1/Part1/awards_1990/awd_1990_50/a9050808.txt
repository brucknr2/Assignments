Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              There is an increasing awareness of the importance of                          
              macromolecular chemistry.  Indeed, some exposure at the                        
              undergraduate level for chemistry majors is now recommended by                 
              the American Chemical Society.  The focus of this project,                     
              through the acquisition of appropriate instrumentation, is to                  
              significantly improve the level of exposure for students to                    
              several important aspects of polymer chemistry.                                
                                                                                             
              A core course was in place but had several gaps in the laboratory              
              program.  Specifically, the significant areas of thermal analysis              
              and molecular weight distribution were treated only with "dry                  
              labs".  The acquired Differential Scanning Calorimeter and High                
              Pressure Gel Permeation Chromatograph allowed a number of in-                  
              depth experiments to be done, not only in Polymer Chemistry, but               
              in several upper level courses as well.                                        
                                                                                             
              The institution contributed to this project in an amount equal to              
              the NSF funds.
