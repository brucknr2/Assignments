Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This three-year project will produce a series of staff development             
              seminars and teachers enhancement materials for teachers in                    
              grades four through six.  Building on the successful "MathTools for            
              Teachers K-3" project at the University of Chicago, the staff will             
              design teacher enhancement materials to develop the connections                
              between the mathematical structures of arithmetic and geometry                 
              and the school curriculum.  Mathematical applications will be                  
              emphasized.  Exemplar student problem sets will be developed and               
              introduced to teachers through the materials.  A series of                     
              workshops for staff development leaders will serve as pilot sites              
              for the implementation of the seminar.  An evaluation of the                   
              effectiveness of the seminars is included in the project plan.                 
                                                                                             
              Cost sharing is provided by the University of Chicago, the Amoco               
              Foundation, the Ford Motor Company, local school districts, and                
              COMAP as 66% of the NSF award.
