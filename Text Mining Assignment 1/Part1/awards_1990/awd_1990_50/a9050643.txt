Abstract    :
              William College is purchasing sensing, digitizing, data recording,             
              and data analyzing equipment which allows them to transform their              
              freshman seminar and senior seminar solar-astronomy courses in                 
              order to reflect current instrumental capabilities.  In particular,            
              they are using the total solar eclipse of 11 July 1991, the longest            
              possible solar eclipse and one with extremely favorable weather                
              forecasts, to study oscillations in the solar chromosphere as a                
              test of a mechanism to explain the heating of the solar corona, and            
              to bring the experimental setup and results into the classroom.                
              The experimental results mesh nicely with the theoretical studies              
              already being described in the courses.  This augments freshman                
              seminar in solar astronomy, which currently uses only direct                   
              telescopic views of the sun in white light and in hydrogen alpha,              
              and the junior/senior seminar in solar astronomy, which otherwise              
              has no laboratory component.  Resulting material is also being                 
              included in the astronomy general introductory courses.  The                   
              observations can be repeated at subsequent eclipses, and the course            
              involvement repeated on a continuing basis.  The college will match            
              the award with an equal amount of funds.//
