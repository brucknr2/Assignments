Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is designed to implement the NSTA Scope, Sequence,                
              and Coordination model for science education reform in the Houston             
              Independent School District and the Conroe Independent School                  
              District.  With funding from the U.S. Dept. of Education,                      
              preliminary work has already been done in the Houston School                   
              District at the 7th grade level; the current project extends                   
              through the 11th grade and focuses on program development, teacher             
              training, field testing, and demonstration of grade level models.              
              In addition to working closely with NSTA, the Baylor College of                
              Medicine joins with Rice University and the University of Houston              
              in a consortium approach to this project. Cost sharing in the                  
              amount of $310,292 is 23% of the NSF contribution.
