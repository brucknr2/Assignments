Abstract    :
              This project develops and tests a core of telecommunication                    
              laboratories for data communications, telephony and signal analysis.           
              These laboratories form the foundation of a new program and affect             
              seven new courses.  The equipment requested includes signal analyzers          
              with internal noise generators, protocol analyzers with interface pod,         
              frequency generators, and a personal computer to control a telephone           
              switch.  The signal analyzers are used to demonstrate frequency domain         
              notions and to gain an understanding of Fourier Transforms.  In keeping        
              with engineering technology education, the laboratories provide                
              experience with practical applications of basic concepts.                      
                                                                                             
              The award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal               
              investigator's institution.
