Abstract    :
              Separation processes based upon the scientific principles of                   
              adsorption are becoming increasingly important in the chemical                 
              industry.  On the other hand, current treatment of the                         
              thermodynamic fundamentals and process principles of adsorption                
              is inadequate or non-existent in many core chemical engineering                
              undergraduate curricula and textbooks.  The specific aims of this              
              project are to introduce these topics into our core undergraduate              
              courses, and to establish associated laboratories.  Such                       
              introduction is particularly facilitated by our core curricular                
              structure, wherein one full course considers the fundamentals of               
              phase equilibria and another the principles of separation                      
              processes.  Each of these classes has a laboratory course                      
              integrated with it, which the students take during the same                    
              semester they register for the lecture classes.  A volumetric                  
              adsorption apparatus and a pressure swing adsorption apparatus                 
              (PSA) will be constructed to be included in these laboratories.                
              No major pieces of equipment are requested.  The nature of the                 
              experiments requires that the apparatuses by constructed rather                
              than purchased.  The students will be exposed to several new                   
              concepts peculiar to this subject, which must be learnt for the                
              successful industrial practice of adsorption related phenomena.
