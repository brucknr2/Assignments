Abstract    :
                   The focus of this project is to improve undergraduate                     
              teaching of software development for massively parallel                        
              computers.  The instruction will include communication                         
              between processors, programming languages, parallel                            
              algorithms, artificial intelligence, and data structures.                      
              Since massively parallel computers are quite different                         
              from traditional sequential machines, it is becoming more                      
              important to introduce massively parallel computing early in                   
              students careers.  A 1024-processor Distributed Array                          
              Processor was acquired to support the teaching of massively                    
              parallel computing, parallel language constructs, artificial                   
              intelligence, and parallel algorithms for computational                        
              physics.                                                                       
                   This project is significant because it focusses on the                    
              early introduction of students to massively parallel                           
              computation, which is rapidly becoming an important area of                    
              computing technology.
