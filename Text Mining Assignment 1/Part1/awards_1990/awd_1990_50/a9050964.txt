Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry will acquire two nitrogen lasers, a                
              UV-Vis spectrophotometer and computing equipment for use in the                
              upper division undergraduate physical chemistry laboratory.                    
              New experiments include laser-induced fluorescene spectroscopy                 
              and fluorescence lifetimes, using nitrogen and nitrogen-pumped                 
              dye lasers, flash photolysis and recombination of atoms, and                   
              stopped-flow kinetics.  These experiments illustrate a range of                
              phenomena and techniques in kinetics, and the use of modern,                   
              sensitive equipment.  A laboratory data acquisition system                     
              based on a multi-tasking microcomputer will serve several of                   
              the new experiments as well as some already in operation.                      
              Since the laser experiments are not yet well described in the                  
              educational literature, the new experiments will be published.
