Abstract    :
              Mathematics students are using Iris Workstations by Silicon                    
              Graphics to experiment with chaotic dynamical systems and to                   
              study fractal geometry.  The fundamental ideas of dynamical                    
              systems are studied and the experiments are designed to lead to a              
              rigorous analysis of the systems.  The institution will                        
              contribute an amount equal to the award.
