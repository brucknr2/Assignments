Abstract    :
              This project aims to meet the increasing demand for technicians                
              trained in the use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS)                     
              technology.  The major equipment purchased includes computer                   
              hardware and software to support five GIS workstations.                        
              These make possible the storing, integration and analysis of                   
              information about land aspects including ownership, what is on it,             
              and natural resources.  Associate degree programs in GIS, Civil                
              Engineering Technology and Surveying are affected by this project.             
              The award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal               
              investigator's institution.
