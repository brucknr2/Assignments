Abstract    :
              As the United States becomes more dependent on computer systems, the           
              potential for damage caused by the misuse of private, personal, or             
              secret data stored on these systems increases significantly.  As a             
              result, it is important that the future generation of computer                 
              professionals be trained to understand their ethical and moral                 
              responsibilities in dealing with the information with which they have          
              been entrusted.  In addition, they need to be equipped with the                
              knowledge and tools to enable them to protect that information from            
              misuse.  Hence, this project develops a laboratory-based sequence in           
              computer security.  The two course sequence covers topics in                   
              professional responsibilities, data encryption, network security,              
              operating system security, viruses, and data base security.                    
                                                                                             
              The award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal               
              investigator's institution.
