Abstract    :
              The department of Chemistry is purchasing instruments and equipment            
              (including centrifuges, incubator, shaking water bath, and gel                 
              electrophoresis equipment) to support a new course in the Chemistry of         
              DNA. This course, intended for both science and non-science majors,            
              allows students to gain hands-on experience with the isolation and             
              analysis of DNA, DNA fingerprinting and genetic manipulation. The              
              equipment allows significant improvement in the college's program by           
              supporting the new course as well as an advanced biochemistry                  
              laboratory in which state-of-the-art equipment is needed to provide a          
              suitable experience for chemistry and biology majors. The college will         
              contribute an amount equal to the award.
