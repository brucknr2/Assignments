Abstract    :
              Pitzer College is creating a series of five three-week long                    
              experimental investigations in the Human Physiology course, and is             
              supporting undergraduate research projects in Psychobiology. The               
              physiology lab  consists of open-ended experimental investigations on          
              the nervous system, including membrane potentials, synaptic                    
              transmission, neural integration in motor control, processing of visual        
              information, and a human electroencephalogram. Students make their own         
              electrodes with a microelectrode puller, and use computer interfaced           
              instruments to record and analyze data. These challenging exercises            
              encourage exploration and help students gain a greater appreciation for        
              physiology as an experimental scinece. They will also be better                
              prepared for senior thesis research work, which is required at the             
              college. The equipment used previously in the physiology course will           
              now be used in the introductory biology laboratory, thus benefitting           
              the beginning students with experimental exercises. The college will           
              contribute an amount equal to the award.
