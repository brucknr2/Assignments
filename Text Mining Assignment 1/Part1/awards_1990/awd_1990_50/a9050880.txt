Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry will acquire a computer-controlled                 
              ultraviolet-visible-near-infrared spectrophotometer for use in                 
              the undergraduate laboratory.                                                  
                                                                                             
              Five new and modified laboratory experiments in physical                       
              chemistry will take advantage of the new computer-assisted                     
              spectrophotometer.  The approach is to allow students to                       
              acquire kinetic and spectroscopic data in digital format and to                
              subsequently analyze these data using a scientific spreadsheet,                
              such as RS/1.  In this way, the arbitrary experimental                         
              constraints often imposed on the design of kinetic experiments                 
              can be relaxed, allowing the more general forms of rate laws to                
              be evaluated from the data directly.  Both second order and                    
              enzyme kinetics will be encountered; rate constants will be                    
              obtained using numerical methods of analysis.  Information                     
              enhancement of absorption spectra will be demonstrated using                   
              the second derivative technique that will be applied in real                   
              time, or through subsequent data processing.  This method will                 
              be applied to obtain information about excited states of                       
              molecular systems and complex mixtures.  Students will also be                 
              taught how to use a powerful scientific spreadsheet, in the                    
              numerical and statistical analysis of data. The generation of                  
              professional graphics and the use of statistical information                   
              will be emphasized.
