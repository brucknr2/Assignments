Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The use of computer for controlling instruments and in the                     
              collecting and analyzing of data is an integral part of the                    
              chemistry curriculum today and should pervade all levels of a                  
              student's experience.  The Chemistry Department at Converse                    
              College has used the HRM (Human Relations Media) Software:                     
              Experiments in Chemistry successfully for the last five year in                
              the upper level Physical Chemistry Laboratory and Instrumental                 
              Analysis.  The HRM software allow students to collect real-time                
              data using a thermistor probe or electrode, enter it directly                  
              into the computer and graphically analyze that data.  Because of               
              its success in these laboratories and because the department is                
              committed to the continuing improvement of its curriculum they                 
              obtained nine Apple IIe/HRM computer software set-ups to be used               
              in General Chemistry and Quantitative Analysis for the collection              
              and analysis of data.  This has extended the use of computer                   
              assisted labs into the elementary curriculum where is it used by               
              science and non-science majors alike.                                          
                                                                                             
              The institution has contributed to this project in an amount                   
              equal to the NSF funds.
