Abstract    :
              Students are benefiting from a new mathematics course for general              
              education requirements.  The new laboratory course emphasizes                  
              problem solving and applications in the areas of linear                        
              programming, matrices, probability, and the mathematics of finance.            
              The laboratory is equipped with IBM PS/2 computers running Derive.             
                                                                                             
              The institution will contribute an amount equal to the award.
