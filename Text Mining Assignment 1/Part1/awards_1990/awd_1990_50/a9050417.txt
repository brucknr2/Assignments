Abstract    :
              This project fills a gap in the curriculum of the Computer Science             
              Department.  Workstations and transputers are the equipment additions          
              required to support a new course in parallel programming.  Through             
              classroom instruction and hands-on, laboratory work, the students are          
              introduced to and gain experience with various aspects of                      
              parallelism.  The course focuses on models of concurrency and various          
              mechanisms and techniques involved in parallel programming. The award          
              is being matched by an equal amount from the principal investigator's          
              institution.
