Abstract    :
              This project establishes a modern, advanced Computer-Integrated                
              Manufacturing (CIM) Laboratory for the improvement of the                      
              undergraduate curriculum in Mechanical Engineering.  The objectives            
              are to include (CIM) projects within Computer Graphics and                     
              Manufacturing as well as to offer a new course titled, "Computer-              
              Aided Design and Manufacturing (CAD/CAM)."  This new course is                 
              designed to familiarize the students with computer-aided design,               
              numerical control, computer process control, robotics, group                   
              technology and computer-integrated manufacturing.  The major                   
              equipment selected includes a robot, a CNC lathe, and a milling                
              machine along with a workstation, personal computers and                       
              appropriate software.  This project provides the opportunity for               
              students to work with modern equipment and "state-of-the-art"                  
              software in an important area of manufacturing.                                
                                                                                             
              The award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal               
              investigator's institution.
