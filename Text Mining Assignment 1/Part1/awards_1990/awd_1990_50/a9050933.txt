Abstract    :
              Significant changes in two laboratory courses, Experimental Laboratory         
              in Molecular and Cellular Biology, and Scanning Electron Microscopy,           
              are being implemented by introducing new laboratory exercises which            
              emphasize problem-solving using a variety of techniques. In the                
              molecular course, student carry out projects involving separation and          
              characterization of sub-cellular components. Students have significant         
              responsibility for the design of the experiments and are expected to           
              evaluate the advantages and limitations of the experimental approaches         
              and techniques used. Electrophoresis systems and an ultracentrifuge            
              provide students with the ability to isolate and analyze organelles,           
              proteins and DNA. In the scanning electron microscopy course, a                
              critical point dryer allows students to prepare biological specimens.          
              This project enhances the opportunities available to young women with          
              the aim of encouraging them to pursue graduate education and careers in        
              research. The college will contribute an amount equal to the award.
