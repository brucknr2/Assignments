Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to the Department of Geography at Clark              
              University to help purchase equipment which will be used to improve            
              the undergraduate physical geography and cartographic/GIS courses.             
              The strategy is to continue developing a hands-on problem solving              
              approach in laboratory classes.  The IDRISI-Geographic Analysis                
              System will be used to develop realistic problem solving                       
              applications into skill-enhancing and geographic concept exercises.            
              Software modules, operational and under-development, that explore              
              basic geographic relations will be further integrated into                     
              laboratory sessions.  The major equipment to be purchased includes             
              computing, digitizing and printing hardware.  Besides the benefits             
              that will accrue to students at Clark University by improvements               
              in the geography courses, results will have widespread                         
              applicability throughout North America and Western Europe.  The                
              modules and exercises that will be developed in conjunction with               
              this award, generally will be compatible with this GIS system.                 
              Thus, advances made in the Clark program will be readily                       
              transferable to other institutions.  The grantee is matching this              
              award with non-Federal sources.
