Abstract    :
              This project improves the quality of instruction of upper level                
              courses in computer science in artificial intelligence by providing            
              students with a laboratory of powerful, interconnected workstations            
              and a modern programming environment which integrates artificial               
              intelligence (AI) techniques, graphics, windowing systems, and                 
              object-oriented programming.  With this equipment, students                    
              majoring in computer science, computer engineering, and physics are            
              able to develop advanced software projects, utilizing the state-               
              of-the-art software tools of graphics, windowing facilities, LISP,             
              Prolog, an expert system shell, and object-oriented programming                
              tools.  Also, students in senior research projects, independent                
              study projects, and in the honors program are able to develop                  
              sophisticated AI software using this laboratory.  These experiences            
              with advanced software will provide better preparation for students            
              who wish to go on to graduate school as well as those who pursue               
              careers in industry.  The award is being matched by an equal amount            
              from the principal investigator's institution.
