Abstract    :
              There is an urgent need to educate more VLSI and ASIC design                   
              engineers to keep this country competitive in the world market.  This          
              project provides state-of-the-art workstations and appropriate VLSI            
              CAD tools to teach students VLSI design.  Students learn layout                
              techniques, design verification, design methodology and management,            
              synthesis, testing and other appropriate techniques needed in VLSI             
              and ASIC design.  This laboratory experience addresses the trends of           
              VLSI technology through the associated software providing majors with          
              the required experience to pursue careers in VLSI and ASIC design.             
              The award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal               
              investigator's institution.
