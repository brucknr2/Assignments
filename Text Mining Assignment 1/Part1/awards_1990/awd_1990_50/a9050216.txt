Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The National Zoological Park, a component of the                          
              Smithsonian Institution, proposes transforming three                           
              traditional zoo exhibit buildings into centers for informal                    
              science learning.  Based on current knowledge about learning,                  
              the proposed project will feature interactive elements as well                 
              as the greater use of human interpreters to help visitors                      
              examine animals, handle objects  and play games.  The project                  
              is to be a collaborative effort by the National Zoological                     
              Park, the Dallas Zoo and Zoo Atlanta, with the National Zoo                    
              developing the materials and making and shipping copies to                     
              Dallas and Atlanta as centers for tryout and evaluation, with                  
              the results of the studies going to other zoos in way of                       
              encouraging them of the importance of interactive science                      
              education.
