Abstract    :
              A workshop is to be held at the Wingspread Conference Center to                
              address the structuring and implementation of entry level college              
              courses so these courses may be designed to be more accessible and more        
              rewarding to students than they presently experience.  Participants            
              from diverse types of colleges and universities and from diverse               
              disciplines will, together, address the issues of entry level courses          
              in science, mathematics and engineering for:  1) the major, and 2) the         
              general college student.
