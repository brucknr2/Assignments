Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project provided the chemistry curriculum at the institution              
              with the powerful and modern analytical techniques of gas                      
              chromatography and mass spectrometry combined in a single                      
              instrument.  The instrument was integrated into the laboratory                 
              program at all levels, thereby benefitting approximately 200                   
              students each year.  The instrument is used for demonstration                  
              purposes in freshman chemistry; in other courses, integrating                  
              these analytical techniques into the curriculum is serving the                 
              following goals:  providing practical experience in obtaining and              
              interpreting mass spectral data; demonstrating the physical                    
              principles of GC/MS; hands-on experience with modern, computer-                
              controlled instrumentation; and improving the scientific                       
              capabilities of undergraduate research projects.  Some                         
              experiments that can accomplish the above goals involve the                    
              identification of unknowns, analysis of complex mixtures of                    
              reactions, and the characterization of synthesized compounds in                
              inorganic and organic chemistry.                                               
                                                                                             
              The institution contributed to this project in an amount equal to              
              the NSF funds.
