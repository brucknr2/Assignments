Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              In its thirty years of existence, finite element analysis has                  
              become an indispensable tool of engineering.  Because of its wide              
              applicability, the present lack of knowledge of this complex method            
              among U.S. engineers is costly to our economy and to the                       
              competitive position of our nation.                                            
                                                                                             
              The purpose of this proposed project ISAIAH (the Interactive                   
              Structural Analysis Instructor and Helper) is to utilize modern                
              hypermedia technology to research and develop an Interactive Finite            
              Element Analysis Knowledge Base on a microcomputer laser disk to               
              provide:                                                                       
              (1) engineering students with "hands-on" experience combined with              
              interactive instruction and                                                    
              (2) practicing engineers with interactive assistance during pre-               
              processing and post-processing,                                                
              to improve the quality of finite element analyses and the resulting            
              quality of U.S. engineering.  As a first step toward this goal (to             
              be realized in privately-funded Phase III), a proof-of-concept                 
              Prototype Frame Analysis Assistant on a microcomputer diskette will            
              be formulated and tested in Phase I to:                                        
              (1) verify the feasibility of the hypermedia approach, and                     
              (2) test its effectiveness with engineering students and                       
              practitioners.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              With non-Federal funds, an interim Interactive Frame Analysis                  
              Knowledge Base will be developed in Phase 1.5.
