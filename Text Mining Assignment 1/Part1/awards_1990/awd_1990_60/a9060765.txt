Abstract    :
                   There is an increasing need for improvements in the                       
              fabrication of small diameter orifices in hardened metal                       
              components.  This need is particularly acute in the fabrication of             
              fuel injectors for gasoline and diesel engines.  In those engines,             
              the injectors are used to both meter and atomize the fuel.  For a              
              given pressure drop, the flow through the injector orifices varies             
              inversely with the fourth power of the orifice diameter.                       
              Therefore, small variations in hole diameter result in large                   
              variations in flow.  Existing microdrilling techniques (EDM, laser             
              and electron beam drilling, and others) have marginal accuracy and             
              produce a rough recast layer which results in burrs at the inlet               
              an exit of the orifices.  Poor injector hole quality leads to                  
              variations in fuel-to-air ratio resulting in poor engine                       
              performance and increased pollution.                                           
                   This research addresses an improved microdrilling process.                
              The process is a derivative of electrochemical machining (ECM) and             
              has the potential to produce burr-free holes with tight dimensional            
              control and low cycle times.  This technique would reduce costs and            
              improve the productivity and quality of the injector manufacturing             
              process.
