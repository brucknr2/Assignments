Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is              
              in the general area of materials chemistry and in the subfields of             
              organic synthesis and physical organic chemistry.  Although the                
              number of uses for infrared (IR) radiation is constantly growing,              
              the technology needed for high-speed modulation of IR radiation is             
              still in a state of infancy.  Most IR modulators are mechanical in             
              nature, although some work has been done using inherently slow                 
              nematic liquid crystal optical valves.  Dr. Thurmes will develop               
              ferroelectric liquid crystals for use in non-mechanical electro-               
              optic shutters.  The liquid crystals which are developed will be               
              suitable for use in an IR radiation valve which, depending on the              
              configuration used, will have high throughput (up to 90%), wide                
              spectral-band operation (e.g., 3-5 or 8-l4 um), high switching                 
              speeds (50us), and low power consumption (l0uJ/cm2/switching).
