Abstract    :
              This SBIR Phase I research will experimentally and analytical                  
              evaluate the load bearing capacity of different borehole breakouts,            
              and the feasibility of using such configurations as an excavation              
              shape.  If tunnels or underground excavations incorporate a cross-             
              sectional shape similar to a stable breakout, the cost of support              
              and long term maintenance could be greatly reduced or possibly                 
              eliminated.
