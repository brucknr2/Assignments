Abstract    :
                   An affordable "optical tweezers" microscope system will be                
              developed.  With such a system small objects such as single                    
              biological cells can be captured and manipulated by means of a                 
              focussed laser beam.  The use of inexpensive diode laser                       
              technology will be explored as a basis for a commercial device.
