Abstract    :
              While significant progress has been made recently in color image-              
              analyzed microscopy, considerable intervention by a skilled                    
              microscopist is still required for visual classification of cell               
              types.  An accurate, rapid classification method could                         
              significantly improve the automation of color image-analyzed                   
              fluorescence microscopy for estimating plankton cell size and                  
              biomass and could benefit environmental managers and policy                    
              makers concerned with the quality of coastal and estuarine                     
              waters.  This project will investigate an automatic                            
              classification technique which mimics human visual                             
              classification.  A multilayered perception neural network on                   
              color image features will be trained to perform this                           
              classification in real time.  The image data will be obtained                  
              from whole water plankton samples from estuarine, coastal and                  
              oceanic environments which have been prepared using standard                   
              techniques in image analyzed fluorescence microscopy.
