Abstract    :
              This basic study is to examine the feasibility of using                        
              conducting polymers for the electronically controlled                          
              release of drugs.  The novelty of the proposal is in the                       
              use of a photo-polymerization rather than the more                             
              conventional electrochemical polymerization process.  The                      
              new method allows the three-dimensional growth of polymer                      
              films, and is expected to facilitate the incorporation of                      
              drugs into the polymer matrix.  Since the polymers are                         
              conductive, electrical signals may eventually be used for                      
              controlling the rate of drug release.  Phase 1 research                        
              will concentrate on the study of the photo-polymerization                      
              process.  If successful, this research could have a                            
              substantial impact on the way medicine is delivered in                         
              long-term therapy.
