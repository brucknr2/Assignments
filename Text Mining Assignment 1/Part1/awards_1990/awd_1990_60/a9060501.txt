              For many language processing applications, wide coverage of the                
              language is important.  That is, it is important for the parser                
              to assign reasonable structures to many strings of the language.               
              Wide coverage has not been achieved in spite of many person-years              
              of effort.  The grammars of wide coverage of the language gets                 
              better.  This project will demonstrate that this bottleneck can                
              be avoided by an efficient parser that is designed to accept a                 
              superset of the language.  The problem that such systems have                  
              encountered in the past comes not from the acceptance of                       
              ungrammatical strings, but from the detection of spurious                      
              ambiguity in grammatical strings.  This problem is avoided on the              
              present approach by using new and more powerful disambiguation                 
              strategies based on a more systematic representation of semantic               
              properties and commonsense knowledge than has been available                   
              before, together with powerful automatic reasoning techniques.                 
              Phase I will specify the design of this system in detail and use               
              a careful assessment of prototype performance to establish the                 
              feasibility of the proposed design for commercial applications.                
              In Phase II the specified design will be built and tested in                   
              target applications.
