Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              For electronic packaging applications, the three desirable                     
              properties of an insulating ceramic substrate are: high thermal                
              conductivity, thermal expansion match with the device and low                  
              dielectric constant.  While some monolithic ceramics show                      
              promise, an alternative approach is to design and fabricate a                  
              composite material which will have these properties.  We propose               
              a new material: glass ceramic matrix-diamond particle composites.              
              Since diamond has very high thermal conductivity and low thermal               
              expansion coefficient, we expect that glass ceramic matrix-                    
              diamond composites will have the desirable properties of a                     
              substrate.  In Phase I research, we intend to investigate the                  
              feasibility of fabrication of these composites.  The composites                
              will be fabricated by sinterforging of powder compacts of glass                
              matrix-diamond particles.  The thermal, dielectric and mechanical              
              properties of the composites will be determined as a function of               
              volume fraction of diamond particles in the matrix.
