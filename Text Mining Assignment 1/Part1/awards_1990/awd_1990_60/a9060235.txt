Abstract    :
                   Many outstanding problems in meteorology and climate                      
              research would benefit greatly from the availability of                        
              inexpensive in-situ measurements of the atmosphere, particularly               
              in remote regions of the globe such as over the oceans where                   
              conventional measurement systems are few or non-existent.  The                 
              National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) has developed a                
              family of lightweight digital dropwindsondes, and Aurora Flight                
              Sciences Corporation has developed a low-cost Unmanned Scientific              
              Research Aircraft (USRA) called Perseus.  The goal of this SBIR                
              project is to combine the digital dropwindsonde with the with the              
              USRA to produce a flexible, low-cost system for providing in-situ              
              atmospheric measurements.  During Phase I, the principal                       
              investigators will fabricate a dispenser for the NCAR                          
              dropwindsondes and install it on the Aurora Perseus proof-of-                  
              concept aircraft.  The dispenser concept will be tested as part                
              of Perseus' engineering flight tests in early 1991.  The receiver              
              and data processing unit for this demonstration will be ground                 
              based.  During Phase II, a dedicated airborne data collection and              
              processing system will be developed.
