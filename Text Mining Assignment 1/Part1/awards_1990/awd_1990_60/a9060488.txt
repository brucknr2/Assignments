Abstract    :
              In expressing transformations associated with dynamic 3-                       
              dimensional perspective imagery, log-polar coordinates have                    
              recently been shown to possess significant computational                       
              advantages over traditional Cartesian coordinates.  Reduced pixel              
              count and reduction in calculations per pixel suggest the                      
              feasibility of compact, high-performance systems not possible                  
              with Cartesian systems.  This award will provide Phase I SBIR                  
              funding and will support design of a robot vision testbed                      
              capable of performing useful visual functions such as dynamic                  
              depth mapping and camera/vehicle motion control.  This system                  
              will incorporate new algorithms for visual tracking and depth                  
              mapping that have recently been developed in this field, and will              
              reformulate those algorithms form Cartesian to log-polar                       
              coordinates.***
