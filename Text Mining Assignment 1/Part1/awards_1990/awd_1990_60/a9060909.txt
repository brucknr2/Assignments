Abstract    :
              This is a SBIR Phase I award in the topic area of biological                   
              instrumentation.  Ionics Research Inc. will construct, evaluate and            
              refine a machine that is capable of continuously separating large              
              amounts of biological macromolecules with high sensitivity.  The               
              theoretical basis for the proposed project is solid.  If                       
              successful, such device will be useful for the preparatory scale               
              separation of peptide hormones and other products of biotechnology.
