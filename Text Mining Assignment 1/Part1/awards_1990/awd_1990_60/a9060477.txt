Abstract    :
              There is an important need for compact, lightweight, efficient laser           
              systems that are tunable.  In order for these laser systems to achieve         
              the beam quality and the small size and weight required, they must be          
              solid state systems.  The most efficient source for pumping these              
              systems is the diode laser where 50% efficiencies are possible.  In-5+         
              order to efficiently couple the pump light into the laser and to               
              efficiently extract any heat generated, a fiber laser would be the             
              most attractive.  LaserGenics Corp. has the exclusive license to the           
              patents held by Stanford University on the laser-heated pedestal-              
              growth technique that we will apply to the growth of single crystal            
              fibers of titanium doped A1203, YA103, and MgA1204.  These materials           
              are very attractive as tunable laser sources.  During the course of            
              our proposed program we will study the effects of composition,                 
              temperature, atmosphere, and pull-rate on the growth.  We will also            
              study annealing procedures on these fibers to reduce the titanium to           
              the +3 valence state.  During the Phase II effort we will further              
              optimize the growth of these fibers and construct a tunable fiber              
              laser breadboard based on the single crystal fibers we have grown.
