Abstract    :
                   The PIs propose to design and construct an instrument to                  
              measure carbon monoxide at levels of a few tens of ppbv.                       
              Specifically, they plan to measure the absorption of the neutral               
              xenon laser line at 220.99 cm-1, using the infrared R16 line of                
              carbon monoxide and using the Zeeman effect to shift the laser                 
              frequency to achieve precise coincidence between the laser and                 
              absorption lines.  They state that a simplified version of the                 
              instrument, not requiring Zeeman tuning, would have widespread                 
              use for safety and industrial-hygiene uses where carbon monoxide               
              must be monitored.
