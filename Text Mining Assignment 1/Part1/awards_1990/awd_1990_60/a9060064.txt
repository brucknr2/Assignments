Abstract    :
                   Many manufacturing processes involve as an intermediate step              
              the spot cleaning of small areas of a part which will be subjected             
              to subsequent assembly, coating or adhesive bonding.  Pulsed lasers            
              can give the desired degree of cleanliness but a portion of the                
              technology for the controlled delivery of the laser energy to the              
              workpiece has not yet been developed.                                          
                   All experiments will be conducted in the facilities of Laser              
              Technology, Inc. utilizing existing large scale prototype pulsed               
              lasers.  The Phase I experimental work will not only identify and              
              specify those materials (lenses, mirrors and windows) which would              
              be required for construction of an industrial prototype cleaning               
              station but also more specifically address the unknowns involved               
              in gas flow requirements in the neighborhood of the final lenses               
              and the workpiece.
