Abstract    :
                   A new type of solid state photon detector will be                         
              developed based on TlBr and TlCl.  Crystals grown with these                   
              materials will be produced with graded bandgaps matched to the                 
              emission range of inorganic scintillator particle detectors.                   
              Higher photon detection efficiency will result.  This in turn                  
              can lead to significant resolution improvement of such particle                
              detectors because limitations from photon counting statistics                  
              will be removed.  Improved performance of such detectors can                   
              impact nuclear monitoring and radiation medicine.
