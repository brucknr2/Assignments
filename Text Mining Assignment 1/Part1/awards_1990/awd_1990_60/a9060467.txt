Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Although materials science is a key area of technology, there is               
              little formal treatment of this subject in pre-college curricula.              
              The project objective is to develop a series of ten stand-alone                
              education modules in materials science.  Each unit would be                    
              prepared at three levels of complexity, suitable for elementary,               
              middle school and senior high levels.  The program would utilize               
              interactive physical demonstrations to stimulate scientific                    
              thinking, relate the subject matter to the students' own                       
              experience, and show a relationship to other science coursework.               
              The project would include thirty in-class presentations, with                  
              teacher review and feedback utilized in modifying course materials.            
              The final product would be a package of ten complete demonstration             
              kits, with student support materials and teachers' manuals.                    
              Teacher training would also be part of the implementation of the               
              program.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              A novel aspect of the project is the provision of a framework for              
              involvement by private sector volunteers, and establishment of                 
              private sector contacts as part of the marketing of the modules.               
              Professional societies would be utilized in setting up these                   
              relationships.
