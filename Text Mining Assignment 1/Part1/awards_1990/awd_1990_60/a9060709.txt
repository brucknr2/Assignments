Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Artificial pinning structures promise dramatically increased                   
              critical current densities in superconductors.  We propose: (1)                
              construction and test of composite conductors to complete the                  
              database and (2) use of this database for the testing of existing              
              pinning theories, expanding on them as necessary to indicate the               
              feasibility of factor-or-two increases in critical current                     
              density to be achieved in Phase II.  The composites chosen to                  
              complete the database may have the highest critical currents                   
              every produced in the 0 to 10T field range.
