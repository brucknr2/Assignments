Abstract    :
              The objective of this proposal is to explore the                               
              feasibility of exploiting recent advances in the                               
              understanding of power system voltage relationships                            
              and phenomena, and in the structuring and application                          
              of artificial intelligence methodologies, for control of                       
              power system voltage profiles.  Since the relationship                         
              between voltage control means and their effects are                            
              predominantly local in nature, hierarchical structures                         
              are naturally indicated.  The complexities of the                              
              problem, including mixed mode controls and radical                             
              nonlinearities, have defeated practicable                                      
              implementation of conventional control synthesis.                              
              Recent advances in artificial intelligence methodologies,                      
              including artificial neural net applications, suggest that                     
              their application to this problem might be feasible.  We                       
              propose to develop an appropriate problem definition,                          
              and to assess possible training and control strategies,                        
              including several that have recently been developed or                         
              suggested in the literature.
