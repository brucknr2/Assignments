Abstract    :
              The objective of this Phase I SBIR project is to develop new                   
              detection techniques for rare noble gas isotopes. Two different                
              detector concepts which combine elements of mass spectroscopy,                 
              charge neutralization, photon burst and resonance ionization                   
              spectroscopy will be evaluated. The research offers the                        
              possibility of a breakthrough in detection capabilities of minute              
              quantities of rare noble gas isotopes such as Argon-39.  Argon-39              
              is ideally suited for studying the penetration of greenhouse                   
              gases across the thermocline and for the study of deep-ocean                   
              circulation.
