Abstract    :
              The use of chlorofluorocarbons (CFC) as refrigerants/working                   
              fluid in air conditioning systems and their subsequent                         
              leakage, is a recognized major cause of the depletion of the                   
              ozone layer.  In this SBIR project, the development of a novel                 
                                                                                             
              new air conditioning system which eliminates the air                           
              conditioning CFC emission problem is being investigated.  The                  
              air conditioning system uses air as the working fluid rather                   
              than a CFC or similar synthetic refrigerant making the air                     
              conditioning system environmentally safe.  It is anticipated                   
              that the efficiency and simplicity of the device will make it                  
              a very attractive alternative to current vapor compression                     
              machines.
