Abstract    :
              This project is for an evaluation of the feasibility, cost                     
              effectiveness, life cycle cost, environmental impact reduction,                
              onsite servicing reduction, design, development and testing needed             
              to prove molten carbonate fuel cells for Antarctic applications.               
              The approach involves defining the electric power and service                  
              requirements of the U.S. Antarctic Program, and adapting the                   
              technology of molten carbonate fuel cell power plants to meet these            
              needs.
