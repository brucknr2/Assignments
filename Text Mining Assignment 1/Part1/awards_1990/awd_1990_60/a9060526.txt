Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Ion implantation has been widely used to produce novel non-                    
              equilibrium surface alloys and buried layers of new compounds.                 
              The method is used commercially for a range of materials                       
              requiring wear and corrosion reduction.  However, many desirable               
              combinations of allow concentrations have been found to be                     
              impossible to obtain due to fundamental limitations imposed by                 
              rapid sputtering of the target surface.  A novel method is                     
              examined here to ion implant heavy metals, which usually saturate              
              at 10-15% concentration due to sputtering, to arbitrarily high                 
              concentration (approaching 100%).  This technique effectively                  
              eliminates the 1/S theoretical limit on concentration.  The                    
              technology will have numerous applications in high performance,                
              ultra-pure surface alloys.
