Abstract    :
                   Metal Matrix Composites (MMCS) represent an emerging class of             
              structural materials with potential applications ranging from                  
              dimensionally stable space structured components to high thermal               
              conductivity packages for hybrid microelectronics.  Use of MMCs in             
              commercial applications has been limited to date because of high               
              material costs and extremely high manufacturing costs (both                    
              material fabrication and finishing).  Fabrication of metal matrix              
              composites is usually accomplished via solid state (diffusion                  
              bonding) or liquid infiltration (e.g. casting) techniques.  The                
              objective of the research is to develop a novel manufacturing                  
              method for low cost net shape production of complex components.                
              The approach involves blending of two alloy powders with a ceramic             
              reinforcement mixed together using a highly volatile organic                   
              binder.  During consolidation, the binder is driven off and the low            
              melting matrix powder turns to liquid and acts as a wetting agent              
              to improve bonding between the matrix and reinforcement.  The final            
              composite is anticipated to have properties equivalent to                      
              conventionally processed materials at much lower per unit cost.
