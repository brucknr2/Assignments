Abstract    :
                   The objective of this program is to design a computer                     
              algorithm and prototype implementation to track aircraft in a                  
              sparse reporting environment.  The probability density function                
              of the observed aircraft will be propagated between arrivals of                
              new target reports by means of the numerical solution of a                     
              partial differential equation of evolution of a nonlinear                      
              stochastic differential equation of aircraft motion.  The                      
              resulting non-Gaussian density will be combined with new reports               
              using Bayesian methods to update estimates of aircraft position.               
                   In order to perform the tracking function in realtime, the                
              algorithm will be designed to work in paralled computing                       
              environment.  When implemented in the multiprocessor environment,              
              the algorithm will improve the performance of a currently                      
              operational software system used for aircraft detection and                    
              tracking.
