Abstract    :
                   Modern CFD methods will be applied to calculate multiphase                
              flows.  The focus in Phase one is on separated flows in                        
              pipelines, including stratified and slug flows, where the                      
              individual gas or liquid phases are well represented as continua.              
              The CFD calculations will be performed in regions where one phase              
              exists alone, and the solutions will be matched to find the                    
              interface between the phases.
