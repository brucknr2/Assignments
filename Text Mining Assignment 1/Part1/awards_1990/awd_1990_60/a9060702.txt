Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The need for new materials with improved properties is apparent                
              from the substantial amount of time and money devoted to this                  
              research.  However, it is impossible using current technologies                
              to produce materials with many combinations of properties that                 
              would have high commercial value.  However, organic/inorganic                  
              hybrid (OIH) materials offer a unique alternative to conventional              
              multiphase materials.  OIH materials involve the combination of                
              organic and inorganic materials on a molecular level, avoiding                 
              the limitations of conventional multicomponent materials (i.e.,                
              problems with uneven dispersion, limited molecular mixing, and                 
              weak interfaces between phases).  The goal of this program is to               
              develop polymeric OIH materials with superior thermal and                      
              mechanical properties by combining an organic and an inorganic                 
              precursor.  To achieve our goal we will examine how reaction                   
              variable can be varied to control the morphology and the thermal               
              and mechanical properties of the OIH materials.  In Phase I, we                
              will demonstrate the feasibility of preparing two types of OIH                 
              materials with superior properties: 1) polymers that combine                   
              high permeability, and 2) ceramics that are less brittle and                   
              easier to process than conventional ceramics.  The most promising              
              of these materials will be optimized in Phase II, in preparation               
              for Phase III commercialization.
