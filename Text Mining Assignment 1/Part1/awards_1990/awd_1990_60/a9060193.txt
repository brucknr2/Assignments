Abstract    :
                   This research addresses the problem of how to achieve high                
              quality products at minimum cost.  Manufacturers understand that               
              the way to achieve quality is by controlling the process so as to              
              minimize defects rather than by rejecting parts in an inspection               
              process.  To do this, they need to apply statistical process                   
              control principles to the manufacturing process.                               
                   A potential solution to this dilemma is to put the required               
              knowledge into computer systems which assist shop floor personnel              
              in performing statistical process control.  The objective of the               
              project is to extend prior research into real-time artificial                  
              intelligence systems to enable its application to this problem and             
              to test the viability of this solution in actual manufacturing                 
              operations.
