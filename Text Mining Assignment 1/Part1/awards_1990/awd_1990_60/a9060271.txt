Abstract    :
              This program is directed towards the experimental evaluation                   
              of mixed ionic and electronic conducting membranes for                         
              promoting the cathodic decomposition of nitrogen oxides in                     
              automobile exhausts.  Perovskite cathode electrocatalysts are                  
              used to promote the electrochemical reduction of nitric oxide                  
              and nitrogen dioxide.  The selection of oxide-ion-conducting                   
              solid electrolytes will premit removal of the oxygen formed                    
              and prevent poisoning of the catalytic site.  Electrochemical                  
              cells based on this strategy are fabricated and tested.                        
                                                                                             
              If successful, this approach will permit efficient removal of                  
              nitrogen oxides from automobile exhausts even in oxidizing                     
              environments.  This would allow (unlike present systems)                       
              simultaneous optimization for removal of both hydrocarbons and                 
              nitrogen oxides.
