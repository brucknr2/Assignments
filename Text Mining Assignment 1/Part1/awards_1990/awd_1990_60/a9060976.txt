Abstract    :
              The objectives of this research are to design and implement a                  
              preliminary version of a parallel programming language that will:              
              1. include efficient implementations of general purpose constructs for         
              both shared and distributed memory parallel programming, 2. be capable         
              of increasing the execution speed of applications by at least two              
              orders-of-magnitude, 3. run on a comprehensive set of processors,              
              4. adhere to existing standards as closely as possible, 5. be easy to          
              use and understand, and 6. require minimal recoding of existing                
              algorithms and libraries.
