Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The objective of this project is to investigate methods                   
              for forecasting "lumpy" demand for products and services.                      
              Lumpy demand is usually zero but intermittently non-zero.                      
              Standard forecasting systems cannot cope with lumpy demand,                    
              which is a common problem in production and inventory                          
              control.  The firm's interest in the problem is a response to                  
              their customers in manufacturing.                                              
                   Existing approaches to lumpy demand forecasting either                    
              convert lumpy data into conventional data for conventional                     
              treatment or make parametric models of the lumpy demand                        
              (e.g., a Poisson Model).  There has not been a systematic                      
              comparison of these alternatives.                                              
                   The researchers will empirically assess the                               
              appropriateness and accuracy of these alternatives.  They                      
              will also investigate two innovative approaches.  One is to                    
              explore whether associations across series occur in real data                  
              and how they might be exploited.  The other is to analyze the                  
              method used most often in practice:  "sales-force composite"                   
              forecasting, which totals the estimates of demand made by the                  
              sales force for each potential customer.  Combination of                       
              sales force estimates with time-series techniques may have                     
              special merit when statistical data are sparse, as with lumpy                  
              demand.  This research will lead to the development of                         
              computer software for PC-based forecasting of "lumpy" demand                   
              in manufacturing.
