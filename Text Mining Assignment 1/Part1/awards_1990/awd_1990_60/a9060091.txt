Abstract    :
                   Analysis of atmospheric infrared absorption spectra and                   
              recent developments in infrared laser technology has lead to the               
              development of a new and innovative laser hygrometer.  The                     
              proposed new laser hygrometer offers an outstanding combination                
              of accuracy, sensitivity, and response speed, coupled with high                
              reliability and repeatability in harsh environments, non-                      
              cryogenic operation, compact size, low power consumption, and                  
              modest cost.                                                                   
                   The Phase I research objectives include design and                        
              construction of a proof-of-concept laser hygrometer, verification              
              of its principal of operation and response function, plus                      
              research on a Phase II hygrometer design and Phase II work plan.
