Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Geophysical prospecting for mineral deposits depends on the               
              physical property contrast between various rock units and mineral              
              deposits.  A Broader understanding of the physical structure of                
              the earth can be realized from rock physical data.  A small                    
              pocket sized instrument to measure the magnetic and electrical                 
              properties of rack samples under field conditions would be an                  
              immense aid to explorationists.  This need can now be fulfilled                
              utilizing modern microelectronic technology.                                   
                                                                                             
                   The research objective is to develop a small integrated                   
              meter for field use by explorationists.  Years of experience in                
              physical property studies and instrumentation by our firm can                  
              make this realizable, resulting in the development of such a                   
              meter and demonstrate its scientific usefulness in geophysical                 
              exploration.                                                                   
                                                                                             
                   The critical design must provide conversion of the outputs                
              of magnetic and electric sensors for processing into meaningful                
              geophysical data.  Innovative design will consist of a                         
              multiplicity of sensors independently attached to a master                     
              microprocessor controlled system that are interchangeable in the               
              field of for separately measuring the magnetic and electrical                  
              properties of rock samples.  Research will determine the best                  
              consistent with operational demands.  The effort proposed will be              
              directed toward solving these objectives.
