Abstract    :
              The proposed instrumentation using the combined ultrasonic                     
              attenuation and speckle image correlation strain measurement                   
              techniques addresses these problems by providing a compact, rapid              
              and robust nondestructive examination system for evaluating the                
              material macroscopic properties and surface crack-opening                      
              displacements at critical locations on the full scale operating                
              structures.  Extension of the fundamental correlation between                  
              analytical ultrasonic nondestructive evaluation and mechanical                 
              performance, evaluation of a rugged ultrasonic attenuation                     
              measurement system, integration of speckle correlation-based strain            
              sensing device.
