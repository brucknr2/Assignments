Abstract    :
              Work conducted recently on model analysis has shown that structural            
              changes may be identified by analyzing changes in the vibration                
              spectrum of a structure.  Project will use coherent laser                      
              detection, a technique on which the laser vibrometer is based, to              
              complement model analysis, thereby allowing the remote inspection              
              of large structures for flaws.  A major advantage of the laser                 
              technique is the ability to pinpoint structural elements by aiming             
              the laser at each individually.  This application of coherent                  
              detection will stimulate development of state-of-the-art laser-                
              based systems with new, significant commercial applications which              
              will benefit the US economy.
