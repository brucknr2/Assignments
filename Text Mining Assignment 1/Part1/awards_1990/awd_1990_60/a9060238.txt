Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The objective of this project is to research how a new educational             
              software tool, the Geometer's Sketchpad, based on state-of-the-                
              art computer technology and advanced programming techniques, can               
              best be used by students and teachers in secondary schools.  This              
              research will lay the basis for the development and publication of             
              a set of teacher support materials including both teacher training             
              materials an student activity guides.  These can be used to better             
              enable teachers to effectively use the dynamic geometric                       
              constructions and script saving feature in The Geometer's                      
              Sketchpad.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              This project will include: analysis of educational research that               
              used existing geometric modeling software, observations and                    
              interviews with the initial group of students and teachers using               
              the The Geometer's Sketchpad, assessment of the attitudes and                  
              performance of these same students, identification of teacher in               
              effectively employing the software technology, creation and testing            
              of prototype teaching materials, and identification of needs for               
              teacher training.  Special attention will be given to identifying              
              how The Geometer's Sketchpad can be used successfully by the                   
              broadest spectrum of students, especially those underrepresented               
              in advanced mathematics classes-women, members of minorities, and              
              disabled.
