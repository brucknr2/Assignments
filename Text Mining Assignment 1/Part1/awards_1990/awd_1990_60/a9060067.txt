Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is              
              in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry in the                 
              subfields of electrochemistry and inorganic synthesis.  Caustic is             
              produced in the USA to the extent of 36,500T/day, mainly by the                
              electrolysis of brine.  The anode product, chlorine, is under                  
              considerable pressure for environmental reasons.  For example,                 
              sales are declining to the pulp and paper industry because of                  
              traces of dioxin formed in paper products.  Also, ozone destroying             
              carbon compounds like chlorofluorocarbons and methylchloroform are             
              very likely to be replaced by non-chlorine containing substitutes.             
              As a result there is considerable interest in new technologies to              
              produce high purity caustic without chlorine production.                       
                                                                                             
              The performance of some novel electrolytic cells for the                       
              manufacture of sodium hydroxide, without co-production of chlorine,            
              will be investigated in the Phase I research work.  The cells will             
              use modern membranes and electrodes materials and will be designed             
              to convert non-halogen sodium salts to high purity, aqueous sodium             
              hydroxide by a technology which is both highly energy efficient and            
              friendly to the environment.  The process should be economically               
              viable over a range of scales and be particularly suited to the on-            
              site production of 5 to 40 sodium hydroxide streams free of                    
              impurities such as chloride ion.
