Abstract    :
                   The progress of the technology of promising new materials like            
              ceramics carbides and nitrides is impeded by a lack of good methods            
              to machine them.  The researchers plan to develop a novel machining            
              method based on the impact of very highspeed microdroplets.                    
                   Water drop impact has a surprisingly large erosive effect.                
              This phenomena can be explained by the fact that the stresses in               
              the target are over twenty times larger than the stagnation                    
              pressure of the liquid.  Analytical studies predict that, by adding            
              a second phase of gas or solid, orders of magnitude still higher               
              stresses can be reached.  Based upon previous research experiences             
              on the fracture of ultrasmall (nanoscale) particles and on the                 
              cutting effects of microdrops impacts at high velocity, the                    
              researchers plan to apply high-speed biphase microdrops for                    
              material removal and comminution, and for sonochemical destruction             
              of toxic refractory chemicals produced by biphase microdrop impact.            
                   The first objective is to demonstrate the feasibility of this             
              new tool for machining difficult to work materials.  A further                 
              objective is to investigate potential application to the                       
              destruction of toxic and difficult to destroy chemicals.
