Abstract    :
              Electrically conducting organic polymers are a new class                       
              of low-cost lightweight conducting materials that have a                       
              large number of important practical applications.  These                       
              polymers are of particular interest as a means of                              
              fabricating enzyme-based electrochemical biosensors that                       
              have unique capabilities.  However, several aspects of the                     
              electrochemical methods presently used for the formation                       
              of these polymers as thin films at electrode surfaces                          
              impose severe restrictions for their use in enzyme                             
              electrodes.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              A radically new method for forming conducting polymers,                        
              such as polypyrrole, has been developed.   This method is                      
              highly suited to the fabrication of enzyme electrodes.  New                    
              methods for transducing the reaction of an oxidoreductase                      
              enzyme into an electrical signal will arise from this                          
              approach.  A feasibility study will be performed using                         
              xanthine oxidase and L-amino acid oxidase to determine if                      
              it can be immobilized into conducting polymer films formed                     
              by the non-electrical process.  The activity of the enzymes                    
              toward their substrates will be examined.  This new method                     
              will form the basis for the formation of enzyme electrodes                     
              using a flexible photodeposition technique, and can be used                    
              for the production of conducting polymers on a large scale.
