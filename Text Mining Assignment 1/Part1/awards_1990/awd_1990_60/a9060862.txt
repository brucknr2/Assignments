Abstract    :
              This is a SBIR Phase I project in the topic area of biological                 
              instrumentation.  Princeton X-Ray Laser, Inc. will develop a                   
              technology that allows a 3D display of 2D images.  Such technology             
              will be useful as an attachment to high power microscopes used in              
              cell biology research.  Medical imaging is a long-term application             
              potential, as well.
