Abstract    :
              A research and development program is proposed that would                      
              produce an instrument capable of providing real time                           
              measurements of both NO and soot concentrations in internal                    
              combustion engine exhaust.  This instrument would be capable                   
              of monitoring transients in emission with a resolution                         
              approximately equivalent to one engine cycle.  The necessity                   
              for this instrument is clear:  federal and international air                   
              quality standards are becoming stringent enough to mandate a                   
              significant increase of emission production as a function of                   
              the specifics of engine operation.  Information derived from                   
              the proposed measurement system would allow engine                             
              manufacturers to critically assess their engines performance                   
              over their engine operating envelope.  The key to the                          
              technical approach is to measure concentrations of both NO and                 
              soot with absorption/extinction diagnostics in the infrared                    
              and package the instrument in a fashion that facilitates its                   
              application to engine test stands.                                             
                                                                                             
              This research is of direct interest to the internal combustion                 
              engine manufacturing community.  The outgrowth of the proposed                 
              effort would be an instrument capable of monitoring transient                  
              emission behavior in engines.
