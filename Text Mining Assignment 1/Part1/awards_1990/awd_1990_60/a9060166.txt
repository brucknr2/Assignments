Abstract    :
                   There is substantial need for new sensors which measure                   
              absolute distance for applications in robotic positioning,                     
              machine vision, automatic inspection and gauging.  With its                    
              ability to measure non-continuous changes in position, the sensor              
              could provide feedback measurements for closed loop position                   
              control for robots, CMMs and machine tools.  For automatic                     
              inspection, a highly accurate distance measuring sensor will                   
              reduce the need for mechanical touch probes which are very slow.               
              For machine vision, the ability to measure range will eliminate                
              the need for complicated algorithms which extract information                  
              from intensity images.                                                         
                   The researchers will study and classify the applications of               
              sensor technology in the machine tool industry and carryout                    
              experiments to demonstrate its applicability to one machine tool               
              sensor need: the measurement of material removed by a grinding                 
              machine, and determine a preliminary design for an integrated                  
              optic version of the sensor.
