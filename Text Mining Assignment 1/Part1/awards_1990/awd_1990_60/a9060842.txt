Abstract    :
              This project, "Estimating Software Effort Completion", will develop            
              and extend a technology to avoid costly software project budget                
              overruns.  The technology, Effort Completion Estimating, is based on           
              a mathematical modeling technique called Element Association                   
              Matrices.  The fully developed technology would allow software                 
              project budgets to be better estimated in advance and effectively              
              managed while in-process.  It would also allow selecting which changes         
              can be made to software without risking system instability.  The               
              objectives of the project are to identify critical cases for the               
              mathematical technique, search for quantitative methods to replace             
              subjective assessments, identify the theoretical or empirical                  
              statistical distribution of the modeling technique, and test predicted         
              results with expectations.
