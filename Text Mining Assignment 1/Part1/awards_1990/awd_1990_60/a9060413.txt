Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  There is very little systematic data on volcanic emissions                
              because of the lack of suitable monitoring equipment.  The                     
              available data show a very significant correlation between                     
              volcanic activity and emissions.  Therefore, there is a great                  
              need for new instrumentation that will provide the needed data to              
              understand and model the role of geochemistry in volcanism.  The               
              proposed research is a collaboration between volcanologists and                
              gas sensor specialists to develop and use advanced                             
              instrumentation for systematic monitoring of important volcanic                
              gases  (e.g., HC1, CO2, SO2, H2S, HF, H2O and temperature).                    
                                                                                             
              Recent advances in microsensor technology and electronics will be              
              exploited to develop a rugged, low power, low cost, field worthy               
              monitoring system.  The units would be designed  to collect and                
              transmit real-time emissions data for a period of six months                   
              without any manual intervention.  The data acquired by the                     
              instrumentation is expected to stimulate the development of new                
              models of volcanic behavior.
