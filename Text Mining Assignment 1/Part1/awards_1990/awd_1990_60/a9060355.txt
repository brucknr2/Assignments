Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              New high expansion thermally stable multifilament fiber                        
              reinforcements are key to developing significant advances in                   
              composite materials.  It has been identified that titanium                     
              aluminides allayed with carbon is a highly desirable high                      
              coefficient of thermal expansion, thermally stable materials for               
              reinforcing aluminide intermetallics and other matrices.                       
              Conventional fiber forming methods including thermal chemical                  
              vapor deposition (CPD) has not produced the desired composition                
              of titanium aluminide allayed with carbon.  Recently plasma                    
              assist CVD (PACVD) has been demonstrated to produce aluminide                  
              intermetallic particles and multifilament fibers of TiB2, SiC and              
              TiC on multifilament substrates of graphite, quartz and                        
              molybdenim wire.  The PACVD process is explored here to produce                
              titanium aluminide allayed with carbon fibers on multifilament                 
              substrates of graphite and other substrates.  Metal evaporation                
              and CVD are combined in a plasma to synthesize titanium aluminide              
              allayed with carbon as a fiber material.
