Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to determine the                              
              feasibility of producing a high-performance,                                   
              ultrafiltration system for removing dissolved organic                          
              materials from water.  Specific objectives of the initial                      
              phase of this research include the characterization of                         
              surfactant micelles for solubilization of the pollutants,                      
              evaluation of membrane performance and process                                 
              optimization to determine the technical feasibility of the                     
              process concept.                                                               
                                                                                             
              This project proposes to investigate an innovative concept                     
              for removing contaminants from water by a filtration                           
              process through a membrane.  This is a Phase I award made                      
              in accord with Program Solicitation NSF 90-31, Small                           
              Business Innovation Research (SBIR).  The project                              
              addresses a significant problem in dealing with treatment                      
              of industrial wastewaters that contain petroleum                               
              hydrocarbons and heavy metals and may prove useful for                         
              reducing the environmental impact of those discharges on                       
              surface and groundwater.
