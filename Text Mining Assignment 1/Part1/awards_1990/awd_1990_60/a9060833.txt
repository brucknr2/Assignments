Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a SBIR Phase project in the topic area of biological                   
              instrumentation.  Physical Optics Corp will develop a holographic              
              printer which produces distortion-free three dimensional hard                  
              copies.  This product will contribute significantly to 3D image                
              analysis of biological objects in biomedical research.  In                     
              addition, it will have applications in publishing business.
