Abstract    :
              A software tool which presents analytical solutions of                         
              Laplace's equation offers several advantages over numerical                    
              techniques.  Students in many areas of engineering and physics                 
              will benefit from the opportunity to study parametric                          
              dependence of the solutions.  Aspects of potential theory that                 
              are difficult for numerical techniques, such as highly curved                  
              surfaces and derivative variables, are simple for analytical                   
              methods, so both analysis and design of new structures and                     
              devices will become more accurate. The principal obstacles to                  
              the use of analytical solutions have been the difficulty of                    
              matching the shape to a solution, and the need to perform a                    
              large number of tedious symbolic calculations using algebra                    
              and calculus.  These difficulties are overcome in the proposed                 
              work by implementing an interface which guides the user                        
              through a sequence of graphical menus leading to the desired                   
              solution in a variety of formats, including, graphs, computer                  
              subprograms, and word processing elements.                                     
                                                                                             
              Phase I of the project is devoted to working out the                           
              techniques which will enable the solutions of Laplace's                        
              equation to be generated using a computer based symbolic                       
              mathematics package (Mathematica), and to testing a minimal                    
              version of the program for the suitability of the interface                    
              for Junior level engineering students.
