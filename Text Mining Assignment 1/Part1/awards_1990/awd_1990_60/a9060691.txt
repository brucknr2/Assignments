Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Laser technicians are currently trained by about 25 programs                   
              situated in Community Colleges across the United States.  The                  
              students are goal-oriented and practical with a modest                         
              background in mathematics and science.  Curricula usually                      
              consist of a nearly equal mix of laboratory experiments and                    
              class room lectures.  In general, Laser Electro Optical                        
              Technology (LEOT) students seem to be similar to the students                  
              who take algebra-based physics at college.  Beginning Physics                  
              students have and finds that they confuse important concepts such              
              as position and velocity or velocity and acceleration.  Additional             
              work shows that there is also confusion regarding optical systems.             
              The concepts taught in the LEOT programs are similar to, but more              
              complex than, those covered in a algebra-based physics  course.                
              They are further obscured by the difficulty the students have with             
              the mathematical computations.  No work has been conducted to                  
              identify conceptual difficulties in the LEOT area nor to devise                
              practical approaches to overcoming them.  It is quite evident that             
              they must exist and that they limit the student's understanding of             
              the material just as they do in the physics curriculum.                        
                                                                                             
              Oregon Laser consultants proposes to study ways in which                       
              computer based ray trace program and spread sheets can be                      
              incorporated into the current LEOT curricula to model the                      
              concepts that cause these difficulties.
