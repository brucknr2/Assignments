Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Racemic mixtures of chiral compounds that crystallize as                       
              conglomerate mixtures may be optically resolved using the                      
              technique of direct preferential crystallization.  The method                  
              is based on the selective deposition of enantiomers from                       
              supersaturated solution onto optically pure seed crystals                      
              provided for this purpose.  The technique has inherent                         
              advantages in its avoidance of the chiral auxiliaries and                      
              additional process chemistry that are characteristic of other                  
              methods for producing optically pure drugs.  While                             
              preferential crystallization has been applied successfully to                  
              produce several important chiral compounds, it would                           
              undoubtedly be more widely used were it not for the fact that                  
              selective crystallization can be a difficult process to                        
              control on the large scale.                                                    
                                                                                             
              It is proposed to examine the feasibility and potential                        
              benefits of membrane-stabilized preferential crystallization                   
              for stereoisomer separations.  In the novel process, selective                 
              membranes are used to confine individual enantiomers and seed                  
              in such away as to enhance the stability of crystallization                    
              and thereby to improve process reliability and efficiency.
