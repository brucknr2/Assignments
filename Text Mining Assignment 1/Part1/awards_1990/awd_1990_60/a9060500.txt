Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The impact, or dynamic pounding, of adjacent                                   
              buildings has been identified as a major                                       
              cause of damage during severe earthquakes.                                     
              Because of the serious potential of                                            
              structural and nonstructural damage by                                         
              pounding during seismic events, efficient                                      
              methods and techniques to mitigate this                                        
              impact are needed.                                                             
                                                                                             
              The proposed research is aimed at the                                          
              development of pounding reduction devices                                      
              (PRDs) for adjacent buildings located in                                       
              congested urban centers.  Consideration will                                   
              be given to the systematic treatment of                                        
              uncertainties in the knowledge of the                                          
              properties and mechanics of existing                                           
              buildings subject to pounding and in                                           
              predicting future earthquake ground motions.                                   
              These uncertainties will play an important                                     
              role in optimizing the mechanical properties                                   
              of the proposed PRD components.                                                
                                                                                             
              This research will investigate the economic                                    
              feasibility of installing PDRs, developing                                     
              promising mechanical design concepts, a model                                  
              application, and analysis methods.  In                                         
              addition the research focuses on the                                           
              development of hardware specifications for                                     
              the devices and methods of installation.
