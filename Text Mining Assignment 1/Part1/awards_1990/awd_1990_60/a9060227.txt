Abstract    :
              The construction and expression of a recombinant immunotoxin                   
              consisting of a single chain antibody fused to ricin toxin is                  
              proposed.  The use of recombinant DNA technology to design and                 
              express immunotoxins has numerous advantages over current                      
              biochemical methods of preparation.  These include formation of a              
              recombinant protein that contains only the sequences required for              
              specific cell recognition and cytotoxic activity.  Prokaryotic                 
              expression systems an provide high yields of uniformly produced                
              protein.  Intact ricin contains nonspecific galactose-binding                  
              sites, currently these must be blocked y chemical means in order               
              to permit the antibody portion of the immunotoxin to selectively               
              target tumors.  Expression of recombinant ricin in E.coli will                 
              facilitate the mutagenesis and screening of genetically modified               
              lectin-deficient ricin immunotoxins.  If biologically active, a                
              recombinant ricin immunotoxin will permit dissection of the nature             
              of ricin binding and entry into cells, and will serve as a                     
              prototype in the molecular restructuring of other carrier                      
              protein/ricin hybrids.
