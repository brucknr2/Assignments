Abstract    :
              The objective of the proposed program is to develop a prototype of a           
              novel large area, thin film, microwave diamond deposition reactor.             
              Present microwave reactors for the deposition of thin diamond and              
              diamond-like films from the gas phase are limited to small diameters,          
              typically 2-3".  The possibility of achieving larger area thin films           
              would open new possibilities for these coatings which possess unique           
              corrosion, chemical, electrical, optical and hardness properties.              
              There are direct commercial applications for such films in a variety           
              of markets.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              The proposed reactor design exploits the physics of microwave plasma           
              formation to generate a spatially uniform flux of chemically excited           
              process gas to the substrate on which the thin film is grown.  In              
              order to attain this uniform flow, however, neutral gas fluid flows,           
              plasma generation and microwave coupling must be carefully modeled in          
              order to provide design tools with which to refine initial proof of            
              principle prototypes.  In Phase I these modeling tools would be                
              developed and a prototype design working drawings created.  In Phase           
              II, the prototype would be built and optimized.
