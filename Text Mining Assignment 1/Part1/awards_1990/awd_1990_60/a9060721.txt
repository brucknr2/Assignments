Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The electrical and material properties of high temperature                     
              superconducting (HTSC) thin films have improved dramatically in                
              recent months.  However, a fabrication process capable of                      
              producing Josephson junctions in finite yields has yet to be                   
              developed.  Some demonstration devices have been made which                    
              indicate that the 77 K noise levels of dc SQUIDs made from                     
              thallium-barium-calcium-copper-oxide are low enough for many                   
              applications.  Unfortunately, a basic understanding of the                     
              processing protocol needed to reproducibly achieve suitable I-V                
              characteristics is lacking.  The objective of this Phase I                     
              program is to establish the basic processing technology required               
              for reliable weak link fabrication in thallium-boricum-calcium-                
              copper-oxide.  A novel approach will be investigated which takes               
              advantage of the high volatility of thallium oxide.  The current-              
              voltage characteristics of the weak links will be measured and                 
              optimum processing conditions developed.  These results will                   
              establish the feasibility of reproducibly fabricating links in                 
              microbridges of thallium-barium-calcium-copper-oxide.  These                   
              results will provide the key component required to fabricate                   
              active HTSC devices such as SQUIDS and microwave mixers in the                 
              Phase II Program.
