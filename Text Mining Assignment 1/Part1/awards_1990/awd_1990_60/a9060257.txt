Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              The objective of this investigation is to address software                     
              architectural issues which will facilitate the implementation of               
              advanced finite element technology for parallel and distributed                
              computational processing systems and to produce a prototype                    
              software system for use in demonstrating and benchmarking the                  
              techniques  investigated.                                                      
                                                                                             
              The software architecture to be developed will permit an                       
              evaluation of the applicability and feasibility of a variety of                
              concepts related to finite element methods for solid mechanics                 
              analysis which have shown promise as a result of recent research               
              in engineering, mathematics, and computer science including:                   
              hp-version finite element methods, adaptive meshing using non-                 
              conforming elements, solution of systems of simultaneous partial               
              differential equations for medium-grained distributed memory                   
              parallel processing systems.  A prototype implementation will                  
              utilize object-oriented software design and  programming methods               
              and network and parallel computing methods to demonstrate                      
              adaptive hp-version finite element technology for the solution                 
              of 3 dimensional linear static elastic problems.  Techniques                   
              investigated will lead to the development of new tools capable of              
              solving more challenging non-linear problems.  These tools are                 
              important to the nation's ability to design and produce safe,                  
              reliable, and cost-competitive products.
