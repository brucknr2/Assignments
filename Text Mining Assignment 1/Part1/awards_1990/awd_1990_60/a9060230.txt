Abstract    :
              Today's complex system environment and competitive economic                    
              environment demand precise answers to questions concerning                     
              dependability and quality.  Current tools are not providing the                
              ability to model complex fault handling scenarios and often require            
              simplifying assumptions about failure rates, repair rates,                     
              and initial states which lead to incorrect solutions.  Accurate                
              dependability evaluations are a concern of both manufacturers and              
              users of systems who often invest millions of dollars to keep systems          
              operating correctly.  A dependability tool  that can address these             
              concerns is in demand in both the commercial and military                      
              environments.  The development of a simulation tool based on Rainbow           
              Nets is investigated.  Rainbow Nets overcome limitations of previous           
              net-based models by significantly reducing the model complexity.               
              This reduction is achieved by hierarchical tokens, which can be                
              created, destroyed, and have identities and features, and by                   
              transitions whose activation is governed by a set of rules or an               
              algorithm.
