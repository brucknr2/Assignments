Abstract    :
              The corrosion of steel reinforcing bars in concrete structures is              
              a problem with multi-million dollar impact in both the private and             
              public sectors.  Chloride intrusion from natural (seawater or                  
              marine environments) or man-made (deicing salts) sources                       
              contributes to the breakdown of the protective iron oxide film on              
              the steel.  The subsequent reactions create voluminous corrosion               
              products, causing cracking and spalling of the overlying concrete              
              and reducing the effective strength of the entire structure.  In               
              the proposed program, an electrochemical method for enhancing the              
              corrosion resistance of the rebar during the initial concrete                  
              curing period will be investigated.  The method is in situ                     
              passivation of the rebar surface by application of an anodic                   
              potential.  This treatment will enhance the protective iron oxide              
              film on the rebar by making it thicker and more uniform.  The                  
              effectiveness of this treatment in enhancing the corrosion                     
              resistance of rebar will be evaluated in simulated environments and            
              in mortar-rebar samples.
