Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The objective of this research project is to determine the                
              feasibility of detecting combustible gases at elevated                         
              temperatures directly from the change in work function of a thin               
              metal film.  A broad spectrum of environmentally important                     
              inorganic and organic species have been selected for systematic                
              investigations on promising noble-metal films.  The sensing                    
              mechanism is believed to involve oxygen activation of the metal                
              surface prior to combustion, which provides unique flexibility for             
              developing novel combustible-gas analyzers.  Research activities               
              will be focussed primarily on determinations of the sensor                     
              sensitivity, selectivity, dynamic range, response time, and                    
              optimum operating temperature range.  The changes in work function             
              will be detected using an elevated-temperature Kelvin-probe module             
              already under development by the Arizona Instrument Corporation.               
              Success in the proposed research will potentially lead, in Phases              
              II and III, to the commercialization of a new class of compact,                
              versatile combustible gas sensors and/or sensor arrays                         
              incorporating a degree of sensitivity, selectivity, speed of                   
              response, and stability not previously possible.  The worldwide                
              market for combustible gas monitoring and control instrumentation              
              will permit significant market penetration by AZI in a                         
              technological area currently dominated by foreign interests.
