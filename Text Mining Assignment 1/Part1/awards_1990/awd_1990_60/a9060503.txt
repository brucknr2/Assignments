Abstract    :
              This proposal describes the development of a new class of                      
              electroluminescent devices which have exceptionally narrow band                
              emission spectra and produce bright colors.  The devices are based on          
              thin films of luminescent organometallic compounds sandwiched between          
              electron and hole injecting electrodes.  New organometallic complexes          
              will be synthesized during the Phase I research period and their               
              luminescence properties studied with the complexes sandwiched between          
              electron and hole injecting electrodes.  The luminescence spectra of           
              the proposed devices are considerably narrower than those of previous          
              electrolunminescent devices based on organic thin films.  The color of         
              the devices can be varied by varying the organometallic complex.
