Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Innovative materials are needed to encourage women to consider                 
              careers in science.  A comprehensive, multimedia database with                 
              text, graphics, photographs and audio could highlight women's                  
              achievements in science and provide an exciting tool for student               
              research and a source of entertaining, interactive presentations.              
              While CD-ROM (Compact Disc - Read-Only Memory) technology can                  
              theoretically deliver multimedia databases, almost no research has             
              been conducted to date on how to design such programs.                         
                                                                                             
              Phase I will examine the feasibility of an interactive multimedia              
              database on the topic of women in science.  The study will analyze             
              the appropriate content, audience needs, delivery system and design            
              options for a program aimed at students in grades 4-8.  A prototype            
              example will then be designed and created using HyperCard software             
              and a hard disk drive to model a CD-ROM delivery system.  The                  
              anticipated results of Phase I are a prototype that demonstrates               
              the feasibility of producing a CD-ROM multimedia database on women             
              in science and a set of design guidelines for the Phase II product.            
              Phase II will result in a well designed, audiovisual, historical               
              record of the achievements of women scientists that will be of                 
              interest to students, educators and career counselors.
