Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Instrumentation based on the refracting mode                                   
              of seismic surveying will be developed to                                      
              measure the scouring adjacent to bridge's                                      
              abutments and piers.  The instrument will use                                  
              a repeatable acoustic source placed next to                                    
              the concrete structure with an array of                                        
              hydrophones in a PVC pipe buried in the river                                  
              bed next to the pier.  The repeated signals                                    
              from the acoustic source will then be                                          
              refracted down the pier into the soil.  The                                    
              rate of scouring is slow compared to the                                       
              total travel time of the refracted energy                                      
              thus, allowing signal enhancement and                                          
              detection and measurement of this serious                                      
              problem.  The potential for application of                                     
              this technique is high especially in places                                    
              were bridges are often under flood conditions                                  
              when the weakening of piers and abutments, if                                  
              undetected, can be disastrous.
