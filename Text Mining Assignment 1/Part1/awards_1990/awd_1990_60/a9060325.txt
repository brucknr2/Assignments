Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Increasing demands on the strength and temperature                             
              tolerance for composite materials will require innovative                      
              approaches in composition and fabrication.  Composite                          
              materials composed of single crystal whiskers show                             
              promising tensile strength but have proven difficult to                        
              grow and have not been produced in useful lengths.                             
              LaserGenics Corporation is proposing to investigate the                        
              growth of single crystal fibers of VC and NbC by the laser-                    
              heated pedestal-growth technique.  Fibers of these                             
              materials will be grown, their morphology characterized, x-                    
              ray diffraction and strength measurements made during the                      
              Phase I effort.  Single crystal fibers of multi-metre                          
              lengths of these very high melting point materials will be                     
              the basis of a Phase I program.  Composite materials                           
              incorporating the fibers will be made, the effect the                          
              fibers have on strength will be determined.
