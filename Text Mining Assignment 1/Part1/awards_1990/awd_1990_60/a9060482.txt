Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The objective of this proposed research is to develop a low                    
              cost, high performance filtration media that exceeds the                       
              performance of that which is presently available for the                       
              construction of HEPA filters.                                                  
                                                                                             
              The basis for the media is a low density microcellular foam                    
              process that was developed originally at Sandia National                       
              Laboratories.  This foam process will be combined with                         
              electret formation process to create a microcellular electret                  
              foam filtration media.  The experimental program is directed                   
              towards gaining insight into the interaction between the                       
              necessary fabrication processes and the solvent/polymer                        
              solution required to create the foam and resolution of                         
              identified problems in the adaptation of the foam to                           
              filtration applications.  Also, the incorporation of electret                  
              formation equipment into the fabrication process will be                       
              investigated.  The knowledge gained will be used to develop a                  
              set of guidelines for the design and production of a                           
              microcellular foam filtration media.
