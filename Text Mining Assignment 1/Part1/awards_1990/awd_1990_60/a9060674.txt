Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The phenomenon of fouling plays a major role in the                            
              performance of a wide range of systems including heat                          
              exchanges, organ implants, cardiovascular devices, teeth,                      
              and membranes.  In areas other than the membranes, it                          
              appears that the most non-adhesive, non-fouling surfaces                       
              are quite hydrophobic, with critical surface tensions of                       
              less than 30dynkm.  In the membrane industry, however,                         
              the opposite approach has been adopted in the making of                        
              low fouling membranes.  Hydrophilic, high energy surface                       
              membranes are produced having critical surface tensions                        
              of greater than 40 dynkm. by incorporating polar and even                      
              charged functional groups in the membrane.  One incentive                      
              for doing this is that membranes of low surface energy are                     
              difficult to wet.  Beyond this and for a few other possible                    
              reasons, there remains the question of why the differ approach                 
              is different.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              In the proposed work, both low and high surface energy                         
              membranes will be produced using a novel grafting technique.                   
              The                                                                            
              membranes will undergo fouling tests and performance tests                     
              with a                                                                         
              variety of foulants to define the effect of the research can                   
              lead to                                                                        
              new membrane materials, other approaches at minimizing fouling                 
              in                                                                             
              membrane systems, and to a cost-effective means of producing                   
              low-fouling membranes.
