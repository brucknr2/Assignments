Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Nova Technology, Inc is investigating the use of a laser beam to               
              illuminate a microscope specimen and a reference surface in an                 
              optical setup similar to a Twyman-Green interferometer.  The                   
              scattered light from the specimen is mixed with the scattered                  
              light from the reference surface at the image plane of the                     
              microscope.  By monitoring the speckle intensity with a CCD                    
              array, the phase change in speckle is detected for surface                     
              displacement measurement.  Intermittently the reference                        
              illumination is blocked off so that surface deformation can be                 
              mapped using a speckle pattern correlation technique.  In                      
              addition, the microscope can be illuminated by an incoherent                   
              light source for conventional imaging.  The images from three                  
              different operating modes are then processed and integrated for                
              display.
