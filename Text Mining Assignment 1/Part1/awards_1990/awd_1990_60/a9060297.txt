Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to determine the                              
              feasibility of using discarded vehicle tires for producing                     
              marketable forms of carbon.  The project consists of                           
              developing a predictive model of physical and chemical                         
              changes that occur during carbonization, use of the model                      
              to suggest modifications in processing the tires,                              
              monitoring of carbonization itself and use of data                             
              obtained to refine starting conditions and monitoring                          
              procedures.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              This is a Phase I award made in accord with Program                            
              Solicitation NSF 90-31, Small Business Innovation Research                     
              (SBIR).  The project deals with an approach to pollution                       
              prevention by use of discarded materials as sources of                         
              useful materials.  If proven feasible, this concept would                      
              reduce pollution associated with deterioration of                              
              discarded rubber products and eliminate the potential for                      
              ignition of accumulations of used tires which during                           
              combustion result in emissions of air pollutants.
