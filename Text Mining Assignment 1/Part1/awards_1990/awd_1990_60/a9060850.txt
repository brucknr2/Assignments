Abstract    :
              The proposed research will develop ferroelectric liquid crystal (FLC)          
              waveguide components for optical switching, beam steering, and non-            
              linear optics (NLO) applications.  The optical switching and beam              
              steering FLC components will take advantage of the fast switching, the         
              low power consumption and the large electro-optic effect of FLCs.  The         
              switches will be small in size and can be densely packed to yield              
              large switch arrays which can be continuously reconfigured without             
              encountering the limitations of power dissipation or size that hinder          
              other approaches.  The beam steerer will have large deflections and a          
              large number of addressable angles using low drive voltages.  The FLC          
              NLO components will utilize the permanent polar order of the smectic           
              C* state to orient the molecular hyperpolarizability of the FLC                
              molecules, resulting in a medium with a thermodynamically stable   2           
              non-linear susceptibility.  The   2FLC medium can be used to frequency         
              double near infrared radiation from a laser diode.                             
                                                                                             
              The proposed phase I research will develop waveguide technology for            
              FLCL thin films.  In phase II, the FLC wave guides will be                     
              incorporated into beam steerer, optical interconnection switches, and          
              media for second harmonic generation.
