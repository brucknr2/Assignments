Abstract    :
              There is an increasing need for low cost electron accelerators which           
              are compact, efficient and capable of operating at high current and            
              power levels in the energy range of 10-1000 MeV.  We propose to                
              perform research on the new Induction Synchrotron Accelerator (ISA)            
              concept with the objective of meeting this need.  The ISA operates by          
              recirculating an electron beam pulse ( 30 ns long) through induction-          
              type acceleration cells which are driven by a pulse generator at  10           
              MHz.  The closed-orbit, transport magnet design is similar to that for         
              conventional synchrotrons, and beam pulses are injected and extracted          
              using kicker magnets.  An ISA can be recycled at up to  5 kHz to               
              generate high average beam powers.  The key issue for the ISA concept          
              is achieving the required pulse repetition rate over many                      
              recirculations.  We propose to develop a new pulse generator concept           
              based on the use of high-speed, power-MOSFET switches combined with            
              magnetic pulse compression techniques.  The following research tasks           
              will be performed in Phase I to assess the technical feasibility of            
              the ISA concept:  (1) demonstrate that switches formed using series-           
              parallel arrays of power-MOSFET devices are suitable for ISA                   
              applications; (2) perform experiments to characterize and evaluate a           
              small-scale ISA driver circuit and (3) develop a conceptual design for         
              a Phase II proof-of-principle ISA experiment.  If successful, this             
              work will verify the technical feasibility of critical aspects of the          
              ISA concept.
