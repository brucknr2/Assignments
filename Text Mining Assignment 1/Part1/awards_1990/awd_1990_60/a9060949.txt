Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is              
              in the general area of instrumentation development in the                      
              subfield of infrared spectrometry.  The most widely used                       
              instrument for infrared spectral analysis is the Fourier transform             
              infrared (FT-IR) spectrometer.  When applied to non-repetitive                 
              samples this instrument has limited time resolution.  Dr. Solomon              
              will use a different transform, a wavelet transform, for the IR                
              interferograms, to considerably improve the time resolution, and               
              at the same time to present the results in readily usable form.                
              With no change in hardware, a wavelet transform will improve the               
              time resolution by a factor of 8, for a given spectral resolution.             
              With different hardware  there is a potential for further                      
              improvement.  The wavelet transform method, implemented by                     
              hardware additions to the standard FT-IR instrument, plus                      
              software, would be marketed as an option to the standard                       
              instrument.
