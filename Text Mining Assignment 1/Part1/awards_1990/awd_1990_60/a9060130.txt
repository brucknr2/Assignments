Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Radiation Monitoring Devices, Inc., is investigating the                       
              chemistry and physics of a new approach to detect synchrotron                  
              radiation which combines thin film semiconductor techniques with               
              electrochemical panel technology to produce a large area detector              
              with 100 m spatial resolution.  This approach will lead to a                  
              detector with sufficient density to stop diffracted rays with                  
              high quantum efficiency while maintaining high flux performance                
              and wide dynamic range.  This innovative solid state position                  
              sensitive X-ray detector will have the performance needed to more              
              fully utilize modern high intensity synchrotron sources.
