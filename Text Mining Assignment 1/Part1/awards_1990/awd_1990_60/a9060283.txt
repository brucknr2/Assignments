Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The objective of this work is to synthesize silver coated                      
              nanoparticles which have, among other novel optical properties,                
              the ability to generate phase conjugate light with low incident                
              light intensities.  The experimental program consists of two                   
              parts: 1) determining the experimental parameters required to                  
              generate thin smooth coats of silver on nonlinear dielectric                   
              cores, 2) verifying that the coated particles have the computed                
              scattering and extinction spectra and are able to generate phase               
              conjugate light as predicted.  The coated particles will have                  
              applications in nonlinear optics, for example, in phase conjugate              
              mirrors or optical signal processing devices, and may also have                
              applications as optical filters.  With these composite materials               
              it should be possible to make devices which can operate with less              
              powerful and less expensive light sources than those required                  
              now.
