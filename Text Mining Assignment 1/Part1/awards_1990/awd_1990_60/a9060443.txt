Abstract    :
                   Recent advances in the area of simulation modeling have                   
              focused on improving simulation modeling languages.  These                     
              advances have addressed the semantic gap between simulation model              
              design and an executable simulation program.  They represent                   
              important advances for improving the productivity of simulation                
              modelers but do little to aid the non-simulation trained decision              
              maker.  The objective of this research is to advance the state of              
              the art of the actual simulation model design.  The goals are to:              
              1) reduce the dependency of domain experts on simulation                       
              analysts, 2) assist experienced systems analysts, 3) facilitate                
              effective communication between experts and analysts, and, 4)                  
              accurately translate system design goals and objectives to                     
              executable simulation code.
