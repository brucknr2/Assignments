Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Complex physical interactions which characterize reacting                      
              flows have precluded the development of a generalized                          
              combustor design methodology.  State-of-the-art numerical                      
              models are limited in their ability to perform economical                      
              engineering estimates or to evaluate innovative system                         
              concepts.  Consequently, the design of high performance                        
              combustors relies heavily on an experience data base,                          
              extensive testing, and empirically based estimates of                          
              performance.  Energy International has developed a direct                      
              simulation mixing and chemical reaction processes with a                       
              stochastic model.  It is proposed that the model be applied to                 
              analyze a laminar flame and compare the numerical results with                 
              existing experimental data to gain confidence in the model.                    
              Furthermore, the full-simulation code will be adapted to the                   
              parallel-processing architecture.  The modified simulation                     
              code will be implemented in a multi-processor workstation                      
              network to provide an economical design tool for the industry.                 
                                                                                             
              The application of these concepts will provide an acceptable                   
              engineering approximation to actual finite-rate mixing and                     
              chemical reaction in reacting flows, a practical alternative                   
              to the use of more sophisticated numerical method, and an                      
              essential capability for the design of next-generation                         
              combustion systems.
