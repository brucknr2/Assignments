Abstract    :
              Real-time recognition of speaker-independent                                   
              connected  speech has proven to be a difficult                                 
              problem for electronic systems.  Low-precision                                 
              highly-parallel analog neural networks have been                               
              shown to recognize speaker-dependent small-                                    
              vocabulary connected speech using standard                                     
              components.  This project will research and                                    
              develop massively-parallel custom integrated                                   
              circuits that will perform this task, using                                    
              integrated delay lines and analog computing                                    
              networks.  Phase I will include the design and                                 
              fabrication of test chips to prove the feasibility of                          
              our development.                                                               
                                                                                             
              The approach will utilize standard readily                                     
              available CMOS Bulk integrated circuit                                         
              technology so products arising from this research                              
              can be fabricated reliably and economically by a                               
              number of vendors.  The P.I. has already                                       
              demonstrated using this technology to fabricate                                
              continuous-time analog computing networks and                                  
              non-linear decision circuits.  He have also shown                              
              the feasibility of using floating-nodes to provide                             
              non-volatile storage of analog voltages.  These                                
              voltages can be used to control the operation of                               
              the chip thus implementing the capability to learn                             
              or be trained in the field.                                                    
                                                                                             
              This proposed research addresses the challenging                               
              and important problem of real-time speech                                      
              recognition and may lead directly to inexpensive                               
              products with wide commercial applicability.
