Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Sputtered coatings of solid lubricating dichalcogenides such as                
              molybdenum di       have received considerable attention,                      
              particularly due to vacuum and space applications.  Conventional               
              magnetron sputtered films of these materials on most surfaces                  
              have short sliding life.  A significant enhancement of durability              
              of these films under sliding can be attained by high energy ion                
              irradiation of the sputter deposited films.  The objective of the              
              program will be to study and optimize the enhancement of sliding               
              life of sputtered dichalcogenides coatings on sapphire, M50 steel              
              and silicon nitride by high energy (MeV) light and heavy ion                   
              irradiations.  MeV ion irradiation is preferred over keV beams                 
              because of the current and potential use of films with                         
              thicknesses in the micron range.  The experimental program in                  
              Phase I is directed toward optimizing the conditions and gaining               
              understanding of sliding life enhancement of molybdenum dis                    
              coating on sapphire by MeV ion irradiations.  Both light (H+,                  
              He+) and heavy (Ni+, Ag+) ions at doses in the range of 1x1015 to              
              1x1016 cm_2 are used for this study.  The insight gained in Phase              
              I will be used in developing a Phase II program that will address              
              further optimization and potential applications.
