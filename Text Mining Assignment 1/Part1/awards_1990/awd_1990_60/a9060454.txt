Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The SBIR research addresses a new technique for improving the                  
              working properties of water-based ceramic formulations and the                 
              production yields for objects manufactured from these materials.               
              This extensively used class of materials is employed in                        
              applications ranging from ceramic substrates to bathroom fixtures              
              to monolithic insulators used for high voltage transmission                    
              lines.  While many additives have been used to improve the                     
              handling properties of clays, the losses due to cracking of large              
              ceramic objects during drying remain at a very high level.                     
              Recently, a new additive has been invented which has been proven               
              by our pilot studies to greatly increase the rate and uniformity               
              of drying of certain water-based clays used for decorative                     
              ceramics.  However, virtually nothing is known about the                       
              mechanism by which this additive works nor how to successfully                 
               apply it to ceramics of industrial important.  Therefore, a                   
              scientific study is planned to explore the interaction of this                 
              new additive with water-based clays and to develop a model of                  
              this mechanism.  The model will then be used to guide the                      
              experimental work needed to successfully use this additive with                
              selected ceramics with large commercial markets.
