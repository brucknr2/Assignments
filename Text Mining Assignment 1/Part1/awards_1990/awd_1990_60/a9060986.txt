Abstract    :
                   The objective of this research is to expand and improve the               
              mathematical description and quantitative understanding of                     
              incremental compounding and bending and processes used in the                  
              manufacture of compound-curved metal plates from flat sheet stock.             
              The method is based on differential geometry and finite-element                
              methods.  It will provide lofting of accurate boundary curves to               
              be cut from the flat material, as well as quantitative compounding             
              instructions and potential feedback control, such that plates can              
              be formed which are applicable and/or fully conformed to specific              
              preplanned portions of a designed surface, with minimal or zero                
              field trim.                                                                    
                   Three specific areas are addressed:  (1) discovery of more                
              efficient and accurate numerical methods for solution of the                   
              nonlinear finite-element equations;  (2) formulations and solution             
              of a finite-element characterization of bending, the extrinsic                 
              geometry of the plate;  and (3) finite-element analysis of residual            
              membrane stresses introduced during compounding, and quantification            
              of their effects on the compounding process.
