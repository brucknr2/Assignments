Abstract    :
              This project addresses the active control of noise for                         
              machinery.  In most cases, passive control, by means of                        
              acoustical hoods, is used to reduce noise.  Some                               
              applications include manufacturing machines in industrial                      
              environments, and heating, ventilating and air conditioning                    
              systems in office or residential spaces.  In passive                           
              control, the hood is designed to attenuate the interior                        
              sound field by providing for acoustical damping in the air                     
              cavity and for structural damping in the enclosure walls.                      
              The performance achieved using these techniques is limited                     
              by constraints of volume, weight, and cost.  On the other                      
              hand, the active control approach applies to the design of                     
              a closed loop feedback controller where issues of time                         
              delays, stability, and bandwidth are important.  This                          
              project's approach is to design an enclosure structure that                    
              is as close to a stiff membrane as possible.  Such a                           
              structure's response is dominated by supersonic structural                     
              modes.  Cancellation of exterior noise is obtained by                          
              minimizing the normal response along the enclosure surface.                    
              This approach will be tested and compared with existing                        
              active control strategies.  This approach's expected                           
              advantages include reduction of the number of surface                          
              sensors required to observe the response of the enclosure                      
              walls, and spatial filtering which insures rejection of                        
              excitation by shorter wavelength disturbances.
