Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The objective of this proposed program is to develop a deposition              
              technique for a silver-based high-reflectance coating which will               
              exhibit long-term corrosion resistance under typical terrestrial               
              operating conditions.                                                          
                                                                                             
              The experimental program will be directed towards identifying                  
              specific alloying and overcoating materials, establishing effective            
              stoichiometric ratios of the alloy components resulting in enhanced            
              optical performance and improved corrosion resistance, and                     
              developing efficient techniques for the deposition of the coating              
              layers.
