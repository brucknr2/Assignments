Abstract    :
              A dual laser beam technique involving laser                                    
              evaporation of a liquid target will be developed to                            
              deposit thin films of Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) on                                
              Silicon.  ITO is excellent for use in high speed                               
              electronic devices, while silicon is an optimal                                
              substrate due to availability of high purity, low cost,                        
              large area wafers. Attempts will be made to                                    
              understand the physics of laser evaporation that will                          
              facilitate the production of structures with a spatial                         
              order of nanometers.  Processing will be                                       
              investigated as a function of the power density.                               
              The as-deposited microstructures will be                                       
              characterized and correlated to the process                                    
              variables.  The use of lasers also enhances the                                
              probability of either computer or robotic control in                           
              the development of a rapid growth process for                                  
              depositing ITO on Si.
