Abstract    :
                   The development of integrated design and manufacturing                    
              systems is widely recognized as a critical component in the                    
              effort to improve the competitive posture of American industries.              
              A key to the success of these computer integrated manufacturing                
              systems lies in the robustness of the information integration                  
              supported by the systems.  However, the individual methods                     
              available to support the definition and design of current                      
              information systems are not themselves sufficiently integrated                 
              with one another to permit the cost effective development of                   
              complex real world systems.  The goal of this research is to                   
              provide the necessary theoretical and computational foundations                
              for overcoming this problem.  Its practical upshot will be the                 
              development of automated support for a seamless suite of                       
              methodologies to achieve integrated information systems in                     
              design, engineering, and manufacturing.
