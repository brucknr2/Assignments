Abstract    :
              AstroPower proposes to develop a large-scale, high-                            
              throughput liquid phase epitaxial (LPE) reactor for                            
              the fabrication of multi-layer III-V semiconductor                             
              devices.  A design goal of 1000 cm2 per hour has been                          
              established while maintaining the key features of                              
              LPE: 1) highest material quality of all epitaxial                              
              growth processes, 2) simplicity and safety (as                                 
              compared to MOCVD and MBE), and 3) low cost                                    
              (materials, capital equipment, etc.).                                          
              Liquid phase epitaxy has been used in the                                      
              manufacturing of laser and light emitting diodes using                         
              quaternary (InGaAsP/InP) and ternary (A1GaAs)                                  
              compounds.  The limitations as a production tool                               
              have been due to low throughput.  The design goal                              
              for this program represents a 30x increase over other                          
              large-scale LPE systems and a 3x increase over                                 
              MOCVD reactors.                                                                
              LPE has not been the beneficiary of revolutionary                              
              new ideas because of the mistaken belief that it is                            
              "old technology".  Nonetheless, LPE material is used                           
              as the quality standard in materials comparison with                           
              other techniques such as MOCVD and MBE.  This                                  
              program will result in state-of-the-art LPE reactors                           
              which will have superior throughput, material quality,                         
              and safety compared to any other growth techniques.
