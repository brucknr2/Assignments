Abstract    :
                   It is planned to develop abstract structures to represent                 
              mathematical objects for the purposes of editing, display and                  
              computation.  These structures are to be modifiable through free-              
              form editing, in the spirit of blackboard mathematics, yet easily              
              converted to typesetting languages like TEX, and symbolic                      
              manipulation package like MACSYMA and Mathematica.                             
              The most interesting technical problems raised by the proposal                 
              derive from the tension between these two criteria: a natural                  
              interface with the mathematician, and an ability to recognize and              
              manipulate the highly structured objects that are informally                   
              being described.  The abstract structures will mediate between                 
              the informal notation that the mathematician is comfortable with               
              and the more formal demands of computation.  These structures,                 
              properly formulated, can also serve as vehicles to store and                   
              communicate mathematical content in a natural way, independent of              
              any particular format.                                                         
              The goal is to provide theoretical constructs for a computer-                  
              based system for doing mathematics.  This system will be able to               
              create input to typesetting systems and to interact with symbolic              
              computing packages; it will provide assistance in the                          
              preparation of mathematical documents from the initial ideas to                
              the form.  The constructs can be modeled by object-oriented                    
              programming language like C++.
