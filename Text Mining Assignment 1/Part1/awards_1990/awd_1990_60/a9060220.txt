Abstract    :
              Crystalline silicon is a new material for optical waveguiding in the           
              1.3 to 1.6 micron wavelength range.  This proposal will advance the            
              state-of-the-art of silicon guided-wave optics, especially silicon             
              optical interconnects.  We shall investigate a novel, three-                   
              dimensional, silicon-on-insulator (SOI) guided-wave structure that             
              will allow optical communications on two stacked levels within a               
              large-area silicon wafer.  To do this we shall use multiple implants           
              of oxygen ions based on Spire's unique experience in producing multi-          
              level Separation by Implantation of Oxygen (SIMOX) structures.                 
                                                                                             
              In addition, we shall examine ways of fabricating low-loss SOI                 
              waveguides and high-speed electro-optic (EO) devices integrated in SOI         
              waveguides.  Low-loss guiding and practical EO components are two key          
              areas that need to be researched to establish that silicon is a viable         
              and valuable optical material.                                                 
                                                                                             
              Goal of the Phase II work will be to exploit Phase I results to                
              construct practical, high performance, guided-wave electro-optic               
              components in SOI.  The best-suited SIMOX structures from Phase I will         
              be selected.  Some possible approaches for Phase II are to fabricate           
              Schottky-barrier or p-n junction electrodes on SOI channel waveguides          
              to obtain high-performance optical phase modulators for the 1.3 micron         
              wavelength.
