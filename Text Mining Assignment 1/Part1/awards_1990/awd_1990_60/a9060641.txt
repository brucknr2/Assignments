Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Proton exchange membrane (PEM) based fuel cells are the power                  
                                                                                             
              system of choice for many applications including electric                      
              vehicles, but they require complex water recirculation and                     
              humidification systems for effective operation.  Three anion                   
              exchange membranes identified in preliminary experiments                       
              conducted at ElectroChem form the basis for the proposed                       
              development of novel anion exchange membrane (AEM) based fuel                  
                                                                                             
              cells.  The membranes are OH ion conductive, chemically stable                 
                                                                                             
              in hot caustic, and are not fouled by CO2.  It is anticipated                  
                                                                                             
              that AEM fuel cells will have all the advantages of PEM fuel                   
              cells, namely, no free electrolyte-associated materials                        
              problems, high power densities, and good reliability.  AEM's                   
              are expected to have favorable water transport properties and                  
                                                                                             
              would eliminate some of the problems related to water                          
              management, resulting in system simplification.  It is further                 
                                                                                             
              anticipated that the advantages of alkaline electrolytes--                     
              rapid oxygen reduction kinetics and the possible use of non-                   
              noble metal electrocatalysts--will be maintained without the                   
              problem of CO2 intolerance.  The result should be a simple,                    
              compact, and efficient power system for terrestrial and space                  
                                                                                             
              power applications.
