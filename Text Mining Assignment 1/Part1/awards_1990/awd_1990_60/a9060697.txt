Abstract    :
              Conformal Vapor Phase Epitaxy (CVPE) is a new                                  
              technique for two-dimensional constrained growth of                            
              thin semiconductor films using a halide vapor                                  
              transport process.  This technique will be applied to                          
              the growth of GaAs and InP films on silicon and                                
              sapphire substrates.  Epitaxial-lateral overgrowth with                        
              high aspect ratios is achieved by confining growth to                          
              a thin void space bounded by an oxide-mask coating                             
              the substrate and an adjacent overhanging mask.                                
              This technique has excellent potential for reducing                            
              the detrimental effects of lattice-mismatch and                                
              thermal stress to yield low-defect heteroepitaxial                             
              films.  The feasibility of CVPE for GaAs-on-silicon,                           
              GaAs-on-sapphire, InP-on-silicon, and InP-on-                                  
              sapphire will be studied with experimental emphasis                            
              on GaAs-on-silicon.  Heteroepitaxial materials will be                         
              characterized and minority carrier devices, such as                            
              photodetectors and LEDs, fabricated with the                                   
              heteroepitaxial films, will be evaluated.
