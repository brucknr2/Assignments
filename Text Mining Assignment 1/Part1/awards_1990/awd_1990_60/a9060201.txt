Abstract    :
              The microscale physical topography, or microtexture, of                        
              biomaterial surfaces bears strongly on endothelial and                         
              soft tissue cell adhesion and growth on these surfaces.                        
              Ion beam surface texturing technology offers precise                           
              control of the size, shape, and density of micrometer                          
              scale texture features.  A two stage project is suggested                      
              to investigate ion beam textured organic surfaces as                           
              substrates for epithelial cell growth.  The first stage                        
              will investigate the role of surface texture in promoting                      
              growth of epithelial cells in culture, and establish a                         
              surface morphology which optimizes the rate at which                           
              epithelial cells plate out of solution onto this                               
              substrate.  This technique may provide superior culture                        
              vessels for epithelial cells which are difficult to                            
              culture.  The second stage will investigate the use of                         
              artificial texture on biomaterials to create an improved                       
              skin system for catastrophic burn victims.
