Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A project is proposed to develop reagents and methods for                      
              immobilizing receptors onto polysulfone microporous membranes                  
              used for affinity purification, by photoimmobilizing                           
              hydrophilic polymeric coupling reagent to which the receptor                   
              will then be coupled.  The technique is expected to increase                   
              the amount of active receptor or antibody molecules.  The                      
              technology will be developed using a model antibody after                      
              which it will also be evaluated for efficiency of immobilizing                 
              Staphylococcus aureus Protein A.  Use of these methods for                     
              preparing affinity membranes is expected to increase the                       
              efficiency of the purification process and to reduce the costs                 
              of a variety of bioseparations, including purification of                      
              recombinant proteins, antibodies and plasma from cell culture                  
              supernatants, plasma and ascites fluid.
