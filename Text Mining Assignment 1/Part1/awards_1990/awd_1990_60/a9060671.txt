Abstract    :
                   This project is funded under the National Science Foundation's            
              (NSF) Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program, which is              
              designed to provide an opportunity for small business, particularly            
              the small high technology firm, to participate in NSF research.                
              Phase I of the SBIR program serves as a filter to select promising             
              proposals and determine if the firm can do high quality research.              
              Phase II is the principal research project.  Phase III is the                  
              conversion of the NSF-funded research into commercial applications             
              and technological innovation supported by follow-on private venture            
              capital or other non-federal financing.                                        
                   This is a Phase I project.  This project addresses a well-                
              known problem in communications:  accurately receiving and                     
              demodulating a weak signal in the presence of other, stronger                  
              signals.  The technique could be used in a diversity of                        
              applications including cellular telephone networks and GPS                     
              navigation receivers.                                                          
                   Conventional direct sequence, code division multiple access               
              (CDMA) receivers have limited capability for preventing mutual                 
              interference in the reception and demodulation of the CDMA signals.            
              Performance of a new CDMA receiver structure providing much more               
              rejection of the interfering CDMA signals for a given bandwidth                
              spreading ration is being investigated.  The new receiver structure            
              applies its additional protection to each of the CDMA signals to be            
              received using a hardware-efficient embodiment.
