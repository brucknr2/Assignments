Abstract    :
              The use of protecting groups is a vital tool in the                            
              synthesis of multifunctional molecules such as valuable                        
              "new generation" pharmaceuticals.  When a reaction must be                     
              carried out at a specific reaction site, protecting groups                     
              are used to temporarily block other sensitive reaction                         
              sites on the molecule.  Substituted benzyl alcohols are                        
              particularly useful as protecting groups.  They are                            
              prepared by reacting electrophiles with a simple                               
              derivitive of benzyl alcohol, i.e., benzyl alcohol ester.                      
              Although this reaction proceeds in excellent yield, it                         
              results in a mixture of isomers with similar physical                          
              properties.  Separation of these isomers is technically                        
              difficult and expensive.  This proposal is aimed toward                        
              the development of a novel membrane-based process to                           
              address this problem.
