Abstract    :
              Research conducted at Massachusetts Technological Laboratory (MTL) has         
              demonstrated significant gains in execution speed in phased array              
              algorithms for null-steering and adaptive nulling by implementation in         
              the fine-grained ("data level") parallel computational architecture of         
              the Connection machine.  Such work suggests that significant gains in          
              phased array performance may be obtained by the development of a               
              "smart" phased array, where computational elements are dispersed among         
              the phased array elements and an appropriate network of                        
              interconnections for transfer of information between processors is             
              provided.  Such a "smart" phased array has the potential for                   
              substantially reduced high data-rates, large bandwidth communication           
              with a central computer, and rapid (microsecond time scale) nulling.           
              Additional capabilities for the real-time monitoring  of array                 
              performance and limited automatic failure compensation                         
              ("self-healing") also appear promising.  The Connection Machine                
              is highly suitable for the development of algorithmic tools and                
              simulations for the study of "smart" phased arrays.  A program of              
              research to demonstrate the feasibility of "smart" phased arrays by            
              simulations on the Connection Machine and for the study of their               
              properties is outlined.
