Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              In this project, a zeolite film (membrane) is grown on a                       
              polymer film.  To accomplish this, tetralkyl ammonium ion                      
              templates for initiating zeolite growth are attached to the                    
              surface of the polymer film by long hydrocarbon chains.  The                   
              zeolite, as it forms, grow a channel around the hydrocarbon                    
              chain.  The resultant hybrid film is evaluated for separation                  
              of gas and liquid solution as prepared and after removal of                    
              the polymer film.  It is planned to produce a silicalite                       
              membrane on a cellulose ester film which will be applicable to                 
              the separation of nitrogen/oxygen and ethanol/water solution.                  
              This will establish the basic principles for expansion of this                 
              technology to many other separation applications.                              
                                                                                             
              The development of highly selective membranes will have many                   
              benefits including purer, more competitive products, decreased                 
              pollution and energy savings.  Zeolites with their molecular                   
              sized channels and variable chemical affinities have already                   
              demonstrated high selectivity in many applications.  The                       
              availability of zeolite films would lead to much broader                       
              applications of membrane technology.
