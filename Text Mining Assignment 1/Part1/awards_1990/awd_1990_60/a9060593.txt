Abstract    :
              Magnetic stimulation of nerves is attractive because the                       
              stimulus can be delivered noninvasively.  Current                              
              magnetic stimulation systems are limited by the lack of                        
              precise localization of the stimulus.  The goal of this                        
              proposal is to design new coil configurations, including                       
              different shapes, orientations and multiple coils, to                          
              more precisely control the site of stimulation.  If                            
              successful, the improved stimulation system would find                         
              numerous neurological applications.
