Abstract    :
                   This project is funded under the National Science Foundation's            
              (NSF) Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program, which is              
              designed to provide an opportunity for small business, particularly            
              the small high technology firm, to participate in NSF research.                
              Phase I of the SBIR program serves as a filter to select promising             
              proposals and determine if the firm can do high quality research.              
              Phase II is the principal research project.  Phase III is the                  
              conversion of the NSF-funded research into commercial applications             
              and technological innovation supported by follow-on private venture            
              capital or other non-federal financing.                                        
                   This is a Phase I project.  The results of this project could             
              very well become the basis for more effective commercial                       
              compression subsystems, critical to the successful use of imaging              
              in a computer environment.  The more efficient imaging systems                 
              would require less storage and transmission time and/or provide                
              improved image quality.
