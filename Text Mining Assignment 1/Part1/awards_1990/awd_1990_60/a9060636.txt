Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The concept described herein is an advanced holographic                        
              diffractive structure (HDS) for the control of light at the                    
              wavelength level.  A stack of electrically controllable, liquid-               
              crystal filled diffraction gratings would present a lightweight,               
              clear panel, that, when placed in contact with an aperture shall               
              be able to concentrate sunlight very efficiently into a stable                 
              area in the center of a light guide or fiber optic device.  It                 
              shall be possible to selectively bring into play only the grating              
              appropriate for a particular sun angle and none other, by                      
              applying an electric field (creating a "smart grating").  A                    
              series of such concentrators will thus display active solar                    
              tracking without the disadvantages associated with moving                      
              mechanical parts.                                                              
                                                                                             
              An example of a highly promising application of such a device is               
              described within--holographic collection and transport of                      
              sunlight to a multi-story building's "core" area.  Substituting                
              sunlight for electric light will conserve a significant quantity               
              of energy, particularly during peak load conditions, while at the              
              same time delivering high quality illumination to the building's               
              occupants.  It is anticipated that the control device described                
              herein, could provide formidable energy savings in the U.S.                    
              building sector by the year 2000.
