Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Membrane diffusion is an inherently slow process.                              
              Consequently, membrane-based separation processes can be only                  
              economically viable if extremely thin, defect-free membranes                   
              are used.  Thin-film composite membranes with a permselective                  
              layer thickness down to about 0.5 m can be made by presently                  
              available techniques.                                                          
                                                                                             
              The goal of this program is to develop the technology for                      
              making industrial-scale composite membranes with a                             
              permselective layer thickness of 0.1 m or below.  The                         
              membranes will be made by solution coating an elastomeric                      
              polymer material onto a microporous support.  The upper                        
              surface of the coated layer will then be converted to a glassy                 
              crosslinked zone by surface treatment with a reactive organic                  
              species.  The result will be a zone of thickness less than 0.1                 
              m with greatly enhanced selectivity.  Because the glassy                      
              layer is so thin, the flux will also be very high compared                     
              with that of a standard composite membrane with a glassy                       
              permselective layer.
