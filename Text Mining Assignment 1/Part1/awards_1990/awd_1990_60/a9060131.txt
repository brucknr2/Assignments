Abstract    :
              Timbers used in a marine environment are generally treated                     
              chemically to prevent attack by marine borers.  These                          
              techniques suffer from partial success and offer                               
              environmental hazards.   A novel composite material is                         
              proposed which promises to significantly advance the state                     
              of the art for protecting wooden structures from the                           
              ravages of marine borers, as well as fouling organisms in                      
              general.  The new system will provide for a significantly                      
              strengthened covalent bonding between the cellulosic                           
              wooden substrate and a tough, polymeric protectant layer.                      
              The proposed technology is also attractive since it                            
              involves only environmentally compatible components, and                       
              will be easy to apply.
