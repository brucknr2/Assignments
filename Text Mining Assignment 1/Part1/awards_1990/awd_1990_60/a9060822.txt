Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is              
              in the general area of instrumentation development in the                      
              subfieldof optical spectroscopy.  Recent years have seen                       
              significantadvances in light detection technology and computer                 
              processingpower.  There are two dimensional array detectors, e.g.              
              CCDarrays, that are entirely capable of performing as                          
              scientificdetectors.  Modern small computers are capable of                    
              handling thevast quantities of data produced almost                            
              instantaneously by thesedetectors.  The missing building block in              
              the development of aspectrometer that can take advantage of these              
              developments is anoptical system capable of two dimensional                    
              imaging.  Chromex hasdeveloped a method of producing high quality              
              aspheric optics. They will use this technology to produce a                    
              full.spectrum,multiple.input, flat.focal.field stigmatic imaging               
              spectrograph. The spectrograph will be small, 90mm focal length,               
              and extremelyrugged.  A fiber optic interface will be developed                
              that will allowup to eight simultaneous inputs.  The ability to                
              measure multiplespectra rapidly and simultaneously will make this              
              device apowerful tool in many applications.
