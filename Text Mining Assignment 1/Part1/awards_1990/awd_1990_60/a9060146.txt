Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research applies biochemical techniques to improving the                  
              growth and yield of legumes. A superior nitrogen fixing Rhizobium              
              strain is supported on the surface of seeds with a matrix made of              
              plant derived biopolymer inoculum encapsulated with a semi-                    
              permeable membrane. The feasibility of protecting this enriched                
              inoculum, during seed germination and nodulation, from the                     
              hostile microenvironment around the seed is studied                            
              experimentally.
