Abstract    :
              Gigasample analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) are needed in many              
              fields, from advanced information processing systems to scientific             
              instrumentation used in high energy Physics experiments.  As higher            
              speed ADCs become available, signal capture functions which were               
              only possible in the analog domain, now become possible to achieve             
              in the digital domain, where sophisticated (and far more accurate)             
              signal processing functions may be applied.                                    
                                                                                             
              Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) technology promises a tenfold increase in              
              conversion rate in addition to providing overall improvement in                
              issues such as power dissipation, radiation resistance, operability            
              at higher temperature, etc., as compared to silicon technology.                
              However, GaAs ADC development has been plagued with problems for               
              which no near term solution is foreseen.  The thrust of this                   
              research is in the development of a technology driven architecture             
              that draws upon the strengths of both GaAs and Si technologies.                
              In particular, the research makes use of the significant difference            
              between the signal bandwith ("rise time) and realizable current                
              gain (or current drive) between the technologies to realize low-               
              power high resolution ADCs.  The work involves feasibility                     
              research, modeling and prototype building.
