Abstract    :
              This is a SBIR Phase I project in the topic area of biological                 
              instrumentation.  Ansoft Corporation will test the feasibility of              
              applying a sweeping electric field to electrophoretic separation               
              of large DNA molecules.  This technology tries to circumvent a                 
              major weakness in the existing electrophoretic separation methods              
              for large DNA molecules.  If successful, such technology will help             
              advances in genome research.
