Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Today's urban population is isolated from the producer (farmer)                
              by a myriad of intermediaries, resulting in ever increasing                    
              periods from harvest to consumer. Many researchers have studied                
              innumerable techniques to extend the acceptable post-harvest                   
              time. Numerous investigators have conducted in-depth analysis of               
              the ongoing metabolic chemical processes during the post-harvest               
              era.  Adel Kadar (reference 1) illuminated the magnitude of this               
              subject "...post-harvest losses... is estimated to be 5 to 25                  
              percent in developed countries and 20 to 50 percent in developing              
              countries." Many others concur that respiration rate is the                    
              singular most important process in determining a product's post-               
              harvest life tenure. Many address retention of moisture, vapor                 
              pressure deficit, temperature and relative humidity. The third                 
              controllable parameter- pressure - is appears, has not been                    
              addressed. This research examines the metabolic rate as a                      
              function of positive pressure.
