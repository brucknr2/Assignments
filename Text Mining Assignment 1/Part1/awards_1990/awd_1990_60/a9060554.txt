Abstract    :
              Aerosol processing is a well established method to produce                     
              submicron particles for technologies like pigments and                         
              sinterable ceramics.  Although the particle size distribution                  
              often controls the quality of the final product, this                          
              parameter cannot currently be measured on-line because of the                  
              dense particle streams.  In addition, the number density and                   
              temperature of the particles in the reactor are also unknown.                  
              This proposal is a combined research effort by Advanced Fuel                   
              Research, Inc. and the University of Maine to develop a sensor                 
              for particle analysis of high-temperature gas reaction                         
              mixtures.  The sensor will be on-line and in-situ and will                     
              deconvolute the Fourier Transform Infrared spectra to yield                    
              the particle size distribution.  The Phase I research will                     
              demonstrate the technology by deconvoluting the measured                       
              infrared spectra of known TiO2 particles to yield an accurate                  
              size distribution.  A simple laboratory scale flame will show                  
              that in-situ measurements are feasible.  Phase II research                     
              will include extensive research on a TiO2 flame in an                          
              industrial laboratory.  The final step of Phase II will be a                   
              field test on a commercial TiO2 reactor.
