Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Marine sponges have been one of the richest sources of bio-                    
              active compounds. However, the supply of these sponges must                    
              come from ocean collections.  And with natural collections as                  
              the basis for drug development, the purity and impurity of the                 
              final product is difficult to control. Also, Pharmaceutical, or                
              agrichemical companies will not continue to develop a promising                
              new natural product lead without a secure, reliable supply, or                 
              an indication of a probable synthesis or analog being                          
              developed.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              A controlled environment aquaculture system is proposed for the                
              culture of two tropical marine sponges, for the investigation                  
              and development of novel techniques for harvesting the high-                   
              value secondary metabolites produced by these sponges, the                     
              diterpene antibiotics, the Kalihinols, from  Acanthella                        
              carvenosa, and the antiparasitic and antibiotic, amino acid-                   
              derived Bengamides from Jaspis sp.. The objective is to develop                
              a reliable source that can deliver production quantities of                    
              chemically consistent natural products to researchers.
