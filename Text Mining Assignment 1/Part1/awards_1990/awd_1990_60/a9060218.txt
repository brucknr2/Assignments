Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Superlattice channeling radiation is being investigated as an                  
              intense, quasi-monochromatic X-ray source.  A strained layer                   
              superlattice possesses bent planes which alternate direction with              
              each layer of the superlattice crystal.  A high energy charged                 
              particle which is channeled along a bent plane will follow the                 
              bends in the crystal and this oscillation will cause it to emit                
              radiation.  High energy (10-100 McV) electrons channeled along                 
              the bent planes of a strained layer superlattice emit X-ray                    
              radiation in a single peak of .10% full width half maximum                     
              (FWHM).  This radiation is collimated into a narrow beam, more                 
              intense than standard channeling radiation and far more intense                
              than the background radiation produced.  The characteristics of                
              superlattice channeling radiation make it a promising X-ray                    
              source for non-invasive digital subtraction angiography, which                 
              requires intense, tunable radiation peaks.
