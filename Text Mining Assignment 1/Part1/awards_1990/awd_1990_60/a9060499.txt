Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Several types of photo-responsive polymers have been                      
              developed over the past 10 years.  However, current limitations                
              (such as irreversibility, inadequate physical changes, and high                
              expense) have prevented their widespread use.  Bend Research                   
              proposes to pursue a new class of photo-responsive polymers for                
              use in a variety of applications (e.g., optical memory devices,                
              absorbants, switches in robotic systems, and coatings for                      
              pharmaceuticals and other active ingredients).  Given Phase I                  
              limitations, we will focus this work on controlled-release                     
              applications.  Our goal is to have these polymers provide 1)                   
              reversible (on/off) release of the active ingredient; 2)                       
              pulsatile or sustained delivery; 3) controllable release                       
              kinetics, independent of the triggering mechanism; and 4)                      
              efficient use of many different active ingredients at high                     
              concentrations.                                                                
                   The proposed technology uses azobenzene compounds as a                    
              "switch" to cause reversible photo-induced changes in the                      
              polymer.  When exposed to ultraviolet light, functional groups on              
              an azobenzene compound and an agent compound cause changes in the              
              physical properties of the polymer.  The polymer properties                    
              return to their original values when not exposed to ultraviolet                
              light.  The proposed use of azobenzene differs from previous                   
              development efforts in that it does not rely solely on the                     
              isomerization of the azobenzene compounds as the conformational                
              changes in the polymer.
