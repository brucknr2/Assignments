Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a SBIR Phase I award in the topic area of biological                   
              instrumentation.  Radiation Monitoring Devices, Inc will develop               
              a large area, real-time imaging system for measuring the                       
              distribution of radioactivity on the hybridization membrane.  The              
              project is designed to overcome a limiting step in current                     
              technology (autoradiography) in screening radiolabeled                         
              hybridization membrane.  If successful, such a product will have               
              a wide application beyond DNA hybridization screening in biological            
              research.
