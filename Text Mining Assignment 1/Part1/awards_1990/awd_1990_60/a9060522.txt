Abstract    :
                   This award will provide funds for the research leading to                 
              the development of single crystal fibers of Gd2 SiO5 (CE) for                  
              scintillation detectors.  This material overcomes some of the                  
              disadvantages of the NaI (Tl) crystals, the most widely used                   
              scintillation material, which is hygroscopic, has a long                       
              radiation length, has poor mechanical properties and has an                    
              "afterglow".  If the Phase I succeeds the potential for                        
              commercial applications is good in nuclear and high energy                     
              physics, earth sciences and many other areas of research and                   
              technology.
