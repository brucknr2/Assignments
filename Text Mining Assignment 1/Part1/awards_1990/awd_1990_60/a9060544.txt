Abstract    :
              This proposal is interested in addressing the chemical                         
              aspects of microporous membranes in the synthesis,                             
              purification, and structural characterization of peptides.                     
              The following specific goals are to be accomplished:                           
               - Identify synthetic membranes that are stable enough to                      
                 withstand repeated synthetic manipulations in organic                       
                 and/or aqueous solvents.                                                    
               - Develop effective linkages with suitable spacers to                         
                 preserve the unique advantages of the microporous                           
                 membrance structure while improving the ease of ligand                      
                 attachment and subsequent synthetic steps.                                  
               - Determine the optimum solvent systems for futher                            
                 synthetic elaborations.                                                     
               - Investigate the compatibility of newly developed                            
                 techniques for peptide cleavage resins to assess their                      
                 applicability to removal of synthesized peptide from                        
                 the membrane.
