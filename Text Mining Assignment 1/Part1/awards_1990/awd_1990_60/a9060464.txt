Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposed research concerns a new category of educational tools            
              to which we have given the generic name "Classroom Communication               
              Systems."  Classroom Communication Systems are computer based                  
              communication tools for teachers and students in the classroom, and            
              in many respects are fundamentally unpretentious in their                      
              aspirations.  Nevertheless in early testing in large first year                
              college Physics and Engineering classes prototype systems have                 
              shown that they are capable of producing remarkable results.                   
              Students report that they understand the subject better, enjoy                 
              class more, and work harder.  The Professor who has pioneered the              
              pedagogy for using the systems reports that his large class seems              
              much smaller, and that the atmosphere in the class is substantially            
              improved.  The ultimate objective of the proposed research program             
              is to determine whether Classroom Communication Systems are capable            
              of producing something close to a small group Socratic environment             
              even in a large classroom.  The work focuses on scientific,                    
              engineering and mathematics instruction at a range of educational              
              levels.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              The specific objectives for Phase I include generalizing the                   
              prototype question structure, selecting and/or modifying an                    
              appropriate pedagogical framework for use with such systems,                   
              conducting limited tests based on this work, in college level
