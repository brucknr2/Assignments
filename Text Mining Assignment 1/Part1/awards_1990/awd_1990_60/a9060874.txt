Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to examine the feasibility of                 
              using a wire mesh coated with a base-metal catalyst for                        
              removal and oxidation of soot from the exhaust of diesel                       
              engines.  A number of base-metal catalysts are examined with                   
              respect to their oxidation efficiency and ease of application                  
              to a steel mesh.                                                               
                                                                                             
              This approach promises an inexpensive, effective, and                          
              efficient means of controlling particulates from small and                     
              large diesel engines used in transportation systems.  Such                     
              control is mandated by the Clean Air Act, but effective                        
              technology to accomplish this is lacking.
