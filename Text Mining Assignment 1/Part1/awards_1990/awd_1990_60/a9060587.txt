Abstract    :
              This award will provide Phase I SBIR funding for demonstration of              
              the feasibility of speech recognition on a VLSI neurocomputer.                 
              The speech recognition system will perform speaker-independent                 
              recognition of spoken English letters.  The current                            
              implementation of the system, now running in the context of a                  
              directory assistance application on a Sun4 workstation,                        
              classifies isolated letters of the English alphabet at 96%                     
              accuracy - the best reported performance of any system on this                 
              difficult task.  The high level of accuracy is obtained by                     
              training neural networks to make the important classification                  
              decisions at each level of the system.  Neural networks are used               
              to track pitch, to locate speech boundaries, and to classify                   
              letters.  The goal of the Phase I research is to implement a                   
              complete recognition system in which neural network                            
              classification is performed in real time on the Adaptive                       
              Solutions board.  The research consists of:  (a) experiments                   
              needed to modify the current recognition system to meet the                    
              computational requirements of the board;  (b) implementing the                 
              classification modules on the neurocomputer; and (c) training the              
              neural classifiers.***
