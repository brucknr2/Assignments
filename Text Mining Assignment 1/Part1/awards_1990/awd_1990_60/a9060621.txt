Abstract    :
              A better understanding of the behavior of enzyme modified                      
              biosensors requires a more detailed picture of the                             
              heterogenous surfaces.  This information is not limited to                     
              enzyme modified electrodes, but can be extended to other                       
              organized assemblies such as lipid molecular coatings.  The                    
              proposed research will characterize the surface properties                     
              of amperometric biosensors utilizing Scanning Tunneling                        
              Microscopy (STM), and will also prove the feasibility of                       
              using the STM technique to microfabricate biosensors.                          
              Fundamental STM studies will be used to establish                              
              structural/reactivity correlations.  An understanding of                       
              these correlations will facilitate the productive design                       
              of biosensors, particularly in producing the effective                         
              links between the monitoring biocomponent and the                              
              structural features of the biosensor.
