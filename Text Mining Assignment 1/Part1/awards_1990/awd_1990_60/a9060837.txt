Abstract    :
              Currently used bone cements to fix implants often fail,                        
              requiring major surgery for repair.  This is a proposal                        
              to develop a calcium phosphate cement to facilitate the                        
              ingrowth of natural bone into the gaps between the bone                        
              and so-called "cementless" implants that do not depend on                      
              the cement for long-term mechanical rigidity.  The cement                      
              can be introduced as a liquid or paste which then hardens                      
              within minutes. With time, the cement resorbs and is                           
              replaced by bone.  The Phase 1 study will be an                                
              examination of how different compositions and                                  
              microstructure of the cement affect resorption and bone                        
              growth in animals.  If successful, such a cement would                         
              find broad applications in orthopedic surgery.
