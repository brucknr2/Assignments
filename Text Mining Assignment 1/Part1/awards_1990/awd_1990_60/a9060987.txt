Abstract    :
              Plant cell cultures are a potential source of important                        
              secondary metabolites such as medicinals.  Currently, low                      
              productivities have impeded the commercialization of a                         
              broad range of target compounds.  The compound targeted by                     
              this proposal is taxol, an exceptionally promising                             
              anti-cancer agent for ovarian cancer.  Taxol is currently                      
              extracted from the bark of a threatened plant species, is                      
              too complex for chemical synthesis, and is currently in                        
              very short supply.  Taxol is produced in tissue cultures,                      
              but a ten to hundred fold improvement in productivity is                       
              required for commercial feasibility.  The proposed research                    
              may lead to a commercial process for the production of                         
              taxol by plant tissue culture.
