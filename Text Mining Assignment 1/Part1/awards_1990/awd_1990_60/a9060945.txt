Abstract    :
                   This research addresses solder application to printed                     
              circuit boards and other substrates with a new flexible approach               
              that can be employed in numerous applications, directed                        
              application of molten solder droplets, using ink-jet printing                  
              technology.  Ink-jet printing systems use the ejection of tiny                 
              drops of ink to produce an image.  The devices produce highly                  
              reproducible and controllable drops, so that a drop may be                     
              printed at a specific location according to digitally stored                   
              image data.                                                                    
                   Several distinct applications could evolve from this                      
              research.  These include: (1) A surface mount rework station for               
              replacement of bad, or improperly assembled components that                    
              incorporates a highly accurate and automated solder droplet                    
              dispensing system; (2) An automated in-line solder process that                
              would dispense one or more types of solder, and flux, onto                     
              electronic printed circuit board pads for bonding of high pin                  
              count, fine pitch surface mount components; and (3) Systems for                
              special applications, such as dispensing solder droplets onto                  
              Flip Chip bonds, bumps for Tape Automated Bonding (TAB), and                   
              solder pads for flex circuit interconnects.
