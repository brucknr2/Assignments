Abstract    :
              Aerial wells, a device used in antiquity, are mounds of rocks                  
              which collect moisture from the air and release water.  They                   
              work best in arid regions where solar heating and radiative                    
              cooling are large.                                                             
                                                                                             
              The program will demonstrate that "hydrogenesis", an apparent                  
              natural phenomenon, is the principle exploited in the aerial                   
              well.  A working hypothesis asserts that water is collected by                 
              diffusion into micro pores of rocks and that there is enough                   
              diffusion potential for water to collect at temperatures above                 
              the dew point of the free air.  Analytical models of                           
              controlling phenomena, water collection, retention and release                 
              are being developed to explore the well's performance.  The                    
              models are based on Fick's diffusion equation, Marangoni's                     
              effect and Gibb's free energy equation.  A one-dimensional                     
              computerized model is being developed in Phase I of this SBIR                  
              project.  This model is to provide insight into the                            
              controlling phenomena as a function of independent variables                   
              including humidity and temperature, as well as optimum                         
              material properties.
