Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Recently developed CVD diamond thin films can be used in a wide                
              variety of applications from electronics to cutting tools, infrared            
              optics to abrasives.  High quality diamond films are presently                 
              grown at rates of about 1 micron/hr.  Crucial to the successful                
              commercialization of the technology is the attainment of                       
              larger growth rates.  Atmospheric pressure plasma torches                      
              have been used to obtain high diamond growth rates but are                     
              limited to small areas.  A high power density, 1 kW/cm2 at                     
              200 Torr pressure, microwave plasma discharge is proposed                      
              to increase growth rates by at least one order-or-                             
              magnitude.  A microwave discharge is chosen for scale-up of the                
              deposition area, and the high quality films which are obtained.                
              A study of power density, neutral pressure, substrate temperature              
              and plasma chemistry is proposed, for understanding the mechanisms             
              for diamond growth.  A commercially available high growth rate                 
              diamond reactor could be designed as a direct consequence of this              
              research.
