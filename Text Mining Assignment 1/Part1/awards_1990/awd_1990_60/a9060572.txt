Abstract    :
                   Lead-based paints are commonly used on steel substrates for               
              opacity, reactivity, durability, lubrication, and corrosion                    
              protection purposes.  Conventional sand blasting methods for                   
              removal of such paint coatings result in significant environmental             
              problems and associated disposal costs.  This research is directed             
              toward establishment of an alternative technique namely a laser                
              system for paint removal with considerations of minimum cost,                  
              pollution and hazards.  Fundamental interactions between the laser             
              beam and the paint will be investigated, such as ablation,                     
              spallation,and evaporation mechanisms.
