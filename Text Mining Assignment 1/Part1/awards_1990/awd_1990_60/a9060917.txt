Abstract    :
              This research is directed towards establishing the                             
              feasibility of using wave energy to provide high-pressure                      
              seawater at remote coastal and island locations.  This has                     
              potential commercial value because of the many possible                        
              uses of high-pressure seawater: it can be circulated in                        
              onshore aquaculture tanks, passed through a reverse                            
              osmosis membrane to produce fresh water, or passed through                     
              an impulse turbine to generate electric power.                                 
                                                                                             
              The entire project (Phases I through III) is focused on                        
              the small-scale needs of rural areas in developing                             
              countries, where even the provision of a few thousand                          
              liters of fresh water per day of a few kilowatts of power                      
              would significantly improve basic living conditions and                        
              facilitate economic growth.  For example, the shoreside                        
              provision of ice (requiring both fresh water and                               
              electricity) would enhance the cash-earning power of local                     
              fisheries.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              In order to establish the feasibility of this concept,                         
              fundamental research is needed on the hydrodynamic                             
              behavior of the wave energy absorber, which is an inclined                     
              cylindrical pipe, entirely submerged beneath the sea                           
              surface, with one end resting on the seafloor.
