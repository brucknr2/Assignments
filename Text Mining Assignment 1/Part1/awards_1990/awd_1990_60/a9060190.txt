Abstract    :
              Coherent optical detection offers the potential to substantially               
              increase the capabilities of existing long-haul and local area fiber-          
              optic networks.  However, random drift of the signal polarization              
              presents the major obstacle to this method of detection.                       
                                                                                             
              The objective of this proposed program is to develop a polarization            
              controller that will compensate for this polarization drift enabling           
              the use of coherent detection.  We will research the use of liquid             
              crystals to accomplish this means.  This approach will be                      
              comparatively much less expensive and easier to implement that other           
              methods that are currently under research.
