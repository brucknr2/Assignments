Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to determine the                              
              feasibility of using an electrochemical device for the                         
              paired synthesis of ozone and hydrogen peroxide from water                     
              and oxygen in a cell containing fluorinated sulfonic acid                      
              proton exchange membranes.  Specific objectives of this                        
              project are to evaluate electrocatalysts for reduction of                      
              oxygen, fabrication of a single cell electrolyzer for                          
              paired peroxide and ozone synthesis, and determination of                      
              the efficiencies of this process.                                              
                                                                                             
              Current inefficiencies of producing ozone limit the                            
              broader use of this powerful oxidant and disinfectant.                         
              This is a Phase I award made in accord with Program                            
              Solicitation NSF 90-31, Small Business Innovation Research                     
              (SBIR).  The project deals with an innovative concept for                      
              increasing the efficiency of producing ozone, a potential                      
              oxidizing agent for water contaminants and potentially                         
              more widely used disinfectant for water and wastewater.
