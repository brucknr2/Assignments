Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This work regards the use of clathrate hydrates as dielectrics in              
              high energy capacitors that would operate reliably to                          
              temperatures below -100oC.  Clathrate hydrates are highly                      
              structured complexes of water as host and organic or inorganic                 
              guest molecules. j Their dielectric properties are function of                 
              temperature and composition.  Phase I research seeks to                        
              demonstrate clathrates with the low conductivity of ice, but with              
              large advantages over ice itself.  These advantages include                    
              tunable dielectric relaxation times for high frequency                         
              applications, extended operating temperature range, and possibly               
              minimized volume change during freeze/thaw cycles.  The                        
              clathrate-based capacitors would also be preferable over                       
              conventional capacitors because they are easy to scale-up,                     
              preserve capacity at low temperature, and are independent of                   
              polarity.  The configuration chosen for Phase I is of plane                    
              parallel plates.  Phase II would demonstrate prototypes with                   
              different geometry and optimized material.
