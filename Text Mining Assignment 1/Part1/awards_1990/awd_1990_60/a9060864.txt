Abstract    :
                   For a product to be designed properly, it must be able to be              
              manufactured in sufficient quantity, in reasonable time, and at                
              appropriate costs for its market.  The apparel industry is failing             
              to fulfill any of these requirements and individual firms are going            
              bankrupt at an alarming rate.  CAD/CAM vendors are not designing               
              the appropriate technology for technical design or patternmaking               
              segment, and not considering the domain expertise already inherent             
              in the industry.  Stylometrics TM, an image codification language,             
              representing pattern styles as operational primitives, was designed            
              to fill the missing gap of a 3D/2D P.D.S. (Pattern Design System).             
              The investigator will research the feasibility of computer                     
              supported decision-making in the apparel industry, using this                  
              foundation language.
