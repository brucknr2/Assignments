Abstract    :
              This is a SBIR Phase I award in the topic area of biological                   
              instrumentation.  Scientific Research Associates, Inc will develop             
              a time-resolved flourescence microscopy system using acoustooptic              
              tunable filters as spectral tuning elements and a phase-modulated              
              image dissector tube as a detector.  Potential products from such              
              device include microscope attachments and other imaging system.                
              In particular, it will greatly improve sensitivity of existing                 
              flourescence microscopy technology, which will be extremely useful             
              for biological research.
