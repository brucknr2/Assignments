Abstract    :
                   This project is funded under the National Science Foundation's            
              (NSF) Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program, which is              
              designed to provide an opportunity for small business, particularly            
              the small high technology firm, to participate in NSF research.                
              Phase I of the SBIR program serves as a filter to select promising             
              proposals and determine if the firm can do high quality research.              
              Phase II is the principal research project.  Phase III is the                  
              conversion of the NSF-funded research into commercial applications             
              and technological innovation supported by follow-on private venture            
              capital or other non-federal financing.                                        
                   This is a Phase I project.  Local area networks based on the              
              new international ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) standard will               
              provide high-speed multi-media (data, audio and video)                         
              communication over the same network.  These networks will require              
              fast packet switches that can switch the very small packets                    
              specified by the ATM standard.  Fore Systems is researching                    
              interconnection of multiple fast packet switches in an arbitrary               
              topology to build an ATM-based local area network capable of                   
              supporting hundreds or thousands of attached computers.
