Abstract    :
              This is a SBIR phase one project to test feasibility of using                  
              stimulable phosphors as detector screens in autoradiography of                 
              tritium and 14C.  The project represents a unique application of               
              a commonplace product.  If successful, the product will be useful              
              in screening autoradiograms of biological materials.
