Abstract    :
              Radiation processing, particularly techniques for radiation enhanced           
              shelf life of foods, are important possible applications of electron           
              accelerators.  In order for this to become economically attractive, an         
              electron accelerator of 5 MeV maximum energy with an average beam              
              power of 500 kW must be developed.  Low frequency RF linacs (less than         
              300 Mhz.) are very attractive candidates for this application.  In             
              this work, we propose to build a 100 kV module of such an accelerator          
              with realistic beam loading and an inexpensive 200 Mhz. power triode           
              amplifier in order to test the capabilities this class of machine.             
              Techniques are proposed which will allow the majority of the 1 meter           
              cavities to be insulated with atmospheric pressure gas (Sulphur                
              Hexafluoride), resulting in significant simplifications to the design          
              and cooling of such accelerators.  The module which will be developed          
              will also be tested in vacuum for comparison, and to estimate the              
              heating of the structure in vacuum.  The modular approach which we are         
              using significantly increases the fault tolerance and overall                  
              reliability of the accelerator.  If successful, the costs of high              
              power RF accelerators will be significantly reduced, and the power             
              levels of these accelerators will be significantly increased.
