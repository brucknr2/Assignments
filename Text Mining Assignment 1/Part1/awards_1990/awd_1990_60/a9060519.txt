Abstract    :
                   The ability to measure metabolic activity, as well as the                 
              ability to discriminate among different tissue types, make SPECT               
              a potentially medical imaging tool.  However, the low resolution               
              and poor image quality that characterize SPECT images limit the                
              clinical usefulness of SPECT.  Mathematical Technologies Inc.                  
              believes that mathematical methods are available which will                    
              significantly improve SPECT reconstruction techniques.  The                    
              principle investigator has developed an iterative reconstruction               
              technique based on Markov random field image models in a Bayesian              
              framework.  Experiments with this technique indicate that                      
              dramatic improvements in SPECT image quality may be possible.                  
              The proposed research would address the issues relevant to the                 
              clinical viability of the approach: 1.  the imaging                            
              characteristics of a state of the art machine are to be modeled;               
              2.  Bayesian reconstructions are to be systematically compared                 
              to the best available reconstruction techniques; 3.  the                       
              feasibility of optimizing and/or modifying the computational                   
              algorithms to produce the reconstruction within clinical time                  
              limits will be explored; 4.  the possibility of exploiting this                
              framework to obtain simultaneous estimates of attenuation and                  
              isotope concentration will be explored.  (Current methods must                 
              assume a priori the attenuation structure).  If successful, this               
              fourth research objective would result in a significant advance                
              in the SPECT technology.
