Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Research is directed towards determining the feasibility of                    
              developing an educational software package, for use by                         
              undergraduate level engineering students, which would demonstrate              
              and aid in teaching semiconductor device physics.  The software                
              would be used as an adjunct to classroom studies in a workshop                 
              format.  A variety of fundamental device structures including                  
              diodes, FETs, and bipolar devices would be included in the software            
              which would demonstrate the internal device physics through two                
              dimensional simulation.  Graphic display of the results who vividly            
              show the student how the device operated internally.  The Phase I              
              research would investigate the feasibility of performing the                   
              required simulations efficiently (run times on the order of a                  
              minute) and would construct an initial version of the software for             
              a FET.  This initial software would then be introduced to students             
              at a local university to solicit their feedback and further define             
              their need from such software.  This research would be continued               
              under Phase II and under Phase III, it is anticipated that a                   
              commercially viable education tool, marketable to the undergraduate            
              university community would be produced.
