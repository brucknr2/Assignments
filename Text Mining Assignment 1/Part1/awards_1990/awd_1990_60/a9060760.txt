Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is              
              in the general area of analytical an surface chemistry and in the              
              subfield of catalysis.  Development of efficient, long-lived                   
              catalysts for selective metathesis of functionalized olefins will              
              enable preparation of both new organic compounds and those that can            
              not now be prepared in useful quantities by existing methods.                  
              These are compounds which will, because of the variety of                      
              functional groups they contain, find application as intermediates              
              in many applications of commercial interest.  Catalytica has                   
              successfully developed catalyst systems for metathesis of methyl               
              oleate, an olefinic ester where the functionality is remote from               
              the double bound.                                                              
                                                                                             
              The proposed Phase I program endeavors to significantly extend the             
              demonstrated scope of functionalized olefin metathesis for a                   
              catalyst system of established practical utility.  The substrates              
              selected for investigation are chosen to test fundamental                      
              extensions of the catalyst system.  Performance of the catalyst in             
              the presence of other representative functional groups, in the                 
              presence of functional groups substituted on positions closer to               
              the double bond, and on more highly-substituted olefins will be                
              determined.  The products of the proposed metathesis reactions are             
              multi-functional intermediates suitable for application in the                 
              production of new polymer materials, flavor and fragrance                      
              compounds, pharmaceuticals and lubricants.
