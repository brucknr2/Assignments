Abstract    :
              A system for treatment of water and/or wastewater is being                     
              developed.  Pulsed high voltage applied to electrodes immersed in              
              a water stream creates high potential gradients in the water volume            
              between the electrodes.  These gradients have a bactericidal                   
              action.  In addition, ozone can be generated throughout the water              
              volume by introducing air in fine bubbles from a sparger.  The                 
              applied gradients create ozone and chemically active radicals                  
              within the air bubbles.  The system has several advantages                     
              including:  (1) No persistent chemicals are added to the water, (2)            
              High gradients can be employed by themselves or combined with ozone            
              generation, (3) Ozone is generated within the volume of the water              
              being treated, and (4) Chemically-active radicals are produced                 
              within the water volume, together with ozone.
