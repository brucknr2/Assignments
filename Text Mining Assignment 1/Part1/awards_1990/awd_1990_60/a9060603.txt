Abstract    :
              The goal of this program is to investigate the causes of semiconductor         
              wafer damage during oxygen photoresist stripping with a downstream             
              microwave plasma.  The use of oxygen plasmas for dry stripping of              
              photoresist eliminates the handling, disposal, and resist degradation          
              problems associated with liquid processes.  A downstream, microwave-           
              produced plasma has the additional advantages of no electrode                  
              contamination and low plasma potentials.                                       
                                                                                             
              However, as with other plasma etching methods, downstream microwave            
              processing is associated with wafer damage including mobile ion                
              contamination and electrostatic breakdown of oxide gates, wall-sourced         
              contamination, and degradation from chemical or structural changes.            
              The causes of such surface damage are not well understood.                     
                                                                                             
              We propose to correlate such damage with plasma source phenomena such          
              as UV radiation and surface charging.  During phase I, we will make            
              radial and axial scans of plasma density, electron temperature, and            
              space potential in the vicinity of the wafer while monitoring neutral          
              gas constitutents for a range of stripping rates and plasma source             
              operating points.                                                              
                                                                                             
              For phase II, on the basis of CV curve shift analyses we will                  
              correlate damage with plasma associated phenomena such as UV, surface          
              charging, synergistic effects, and wall-sourced contaminants and               
              develop means of effectively curtailing them.
