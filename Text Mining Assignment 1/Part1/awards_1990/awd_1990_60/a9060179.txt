Abstract    :
              A catalyst system consisting of highly dispersed gold on a                     
              titanium suboxide is being developed.  This is intended for                    
              use in an electrochemical hydrogen peroxide generator that                     
              also employs gas diffusion electrode technology.  The new                      
              system will be lower cost and require much less power for                      
              operation than present state-of-the-art peroxide generators.                   
                                                                                             
              On-site generation of hydrogen peroxide is already used in                     
              many industries, including paper, textiles, and chemicals.  In                 
              addition, a lower-cost generator would be attractive for many                  
              other applications, including water disinfection, that                         
              currently use environmentally undesirable oxidizers.
