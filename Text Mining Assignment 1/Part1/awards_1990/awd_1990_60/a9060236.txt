Abstract    :
                   In response to the need for improved engineered materials for             
              advanced elevated temperature applications, the researchers plan               
              to apply the extensive composite processing experience, knowledge              
              base, and understanding acquired in several ceramic and composite              
              development programs to improving the state-of-the-art in chemical             
              vapor infiltration (CVI) processing.  Specifically, the researchers            
              intend to combine the forced-flow thermal gradient and pulse                   
              techniques of infiltration, directly resulting in higher quality,              
              more economical silicon carbide (SiC) composites for use in heat               
              exchangers and heat engines.  The approach has the potential to                
              solve the recurring difficulty of microporosity between fibers                 
              due to inadequate infiltration, eliminate the substantial                      
              permeability occurring in current state-of-the-art materials, and              
              improve the economics of composite processing via vastly reduced               
              processing times.
