Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal addresses several basic issues of the colloidal                  
              stability in non-aqueous media: the effect of water content in the             
              presence of a surfactant, modeling of flocculation induced by                  
              water, measurements on the stabilizing effect of surfactants, and              
              the correlation between the green body microstructure and                      
              suspension stability.  For this purpose, measurements of                       
              physicochemical properties, such as adsorption and zeta potential,             
              will be performed.  The molecular conformation at the solid-liquid             
              interface will be investigated using Electron Spin Resonance and               
              Nuclear Magnetic Resonance methods.                                            
                                                                                             
              The research has applications in ceramic and tape processing, inks,            
              paints, and in other energy and environment related processes.***
