Abstract    :
              This Engineering Research Equipment grant will contribute to research          
              work on the generation of optical pulses with ultra-high peak power            
              and an extremely high peak-to-background intensity contrast ratio.             
              Using a novel technique called Chirped Pulse Amplification (CPA) the           
              principal investigators have developed a compact, table-top size laser         
              source producing a peak power of one Terawatt and intensities up to            
              1018 watts/cm2.  Present research is directed towards the development          
              of a system capable of generating even higher peak powers.  For this           
              new CPA source to be effective, it is extremely important that the             
              pulses be exceptionally clean, i.e. that they have a very high peak-           
              to-background intensity contrast ratio.  For some applications these           
              extreme peak power pulses will have to have a contrast ratio in the            
              range of 1010:1.  To achieve this, a new modelocked Ti:sapphire                
              oscillator using external pulse compression will be constructed which          
              is capable of producing subpicosecond pulses.
