Abstract    :
              Two methods for determining the pore size distribution of clays                
              will be used to develop and validate a fluid transport model that              
              deals with the movement of contaminants in compacted clays.                    
              Applications could be in the area of waste containment structures,             
              for example the clay liners in landfills.
