Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research allows two anthropologists at the University of New              
              Mexico to test alternative models of male parenting in the                     
              contemporary U.S.  This study will test a specific evolutionary                
              model of the determinants of male fertility and parenting                      
              practices, designed to explain the number of children men have,                
              the economic and noneconomic resources men invest in their                     
              children, commonality and conflict of interest between men and                 
              women in fertility, parenting and mating decisions, and                        
              differential investment in offspring within sibships.  The                     
              predictions of alternative economic and evolutionary models will               
              also be tested.                                                                
                                                                                             
              Data will be obtained through structured interviews with a                     
              representative sample of 750 Anglo and Hispanic men over 50 years              
              of age in Albuquerque, New Mexico.  A short interview will                     
              determine eligibility for the study, and a long interview will                 
              obtain fertility, parenting and income data on three generations               
              of individuals.  This research is important because increased                  
              understanding of fertility and parenting in general will help us               
              understand the causes of the deomgraphic transition, and                       
              increased understanding of fertility in different ethnic groups                
              in the US can help planners design policies to satisfy the needs               
              of different populations.
