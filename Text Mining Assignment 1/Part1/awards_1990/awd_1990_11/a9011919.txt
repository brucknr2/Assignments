Abstract    :
                This research will study the influence of lower crustal fluids               
              in the Loma Prieta area using magnetotelluric and self-potential               
              measurements.  Three-dimensional interpretation of these                       
              magnetotelluric measurements will detail the variation ofj                     
              electrical conductivity around the fault zone.  Self-potential                 
              measurements are related to fluid pressure variations.  The                    
              combination of mapping the resistivity changes and fluid pressure              
              variations in the lower crustal part of the fault zone should                  
              provide important information pertinent to furthering our                      
              understanding of earthquake cycles in the Loma Prieta area.  This              
              research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard                      
              Reduction Program.
