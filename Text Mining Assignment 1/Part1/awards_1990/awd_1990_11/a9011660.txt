Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Long-Term Ecological Research on north temperate lakes is a                    
              comprehensive study of seven lakes and the surrounding landscape               
              in northern Wisconsin.  The study is designed to answer research               
              questions spanning longer time and broader space scales than                   
              typical of ecological research.  Thus, it is especially relevant               
              to analyzing global change and regionalizing site specific                     
              knowledge.  There are five interrelated research areas: 1)                     
              perception of long-term trends, 2) interactions among physical,                
              chemical, and biological processes, 3) temporal responses to                   
              disturbance and stress, 4) relation between spatial heterogeneity              
              and temporal variability, and 5) generalization of results to a                
              landscape scale.   A comprehensive data collection and management              
              system is in place to address these areas and make data available              
              to the broader scientific community.  Climatic, hydrologic, and                
              terrestrial forcing on lakes is analyzed along with internal                   
              processes determining the dynamics of biogeochemical cycling,                  
              production, and species abundances.  Disturbances/stresses being               
              evaluated include species invasions, climate warming, and acidic               
              precipitation.  Spatial heterogeneity and scale are studied as                 
              influences on temporal variation in, and perceptions of, lake                  
              systems.  Spatially explicit models of regional hydrology and                  
              water quality are being implemented. Dynamics of lakes are                     
              compared with other ecosystems types, inside and outside the LTER              
              network.
