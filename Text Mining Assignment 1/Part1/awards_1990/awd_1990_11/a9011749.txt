Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The principal investigator will analyze interrelated                      
              problems concerning hyperbolic dynamical systems and compact                   
              Riemannian manifolds of negative curvature.  Specifically, he                  
              will investigate the classification, differentiability, and                    
              regularity of stable and unstable foliations.  Other directions                
              of research include investigations of rigidity and regularity of               
              global invariants with respect to external parameters.                         
                   This project involves three areas of mathematical research.               
              Dynamical systems is the study of where points go after many                   
              repeated iterations of a continuous function.  Ergodic theorists               
              ask where most, but not all, points go under many such                         
              iterations.  And Riemannian geometry is concerned with the                     
              curvature and other aspects of the base space from which these                 
              points are taken.  The principal investigator will analyze                     
              several problems which stem from attempts to apply theories from               
              all three of these areas at once.
