Abstract    :
              This Research Opportunity for Women Career Advancement Award is                
              in the general area of organic chemistry.  Dr. Leah L. Frye of                 
              the Chemistry Department of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute                   
              will synthesize a series of biomimetic potential ion channels.                 
              Once a macromolecule which will facilitate ion transport across                
              phospholipid layers is prepared, systematic modifications of                   
              its structure will be performed to ascertain what the optimal                  
              locations of heteroatom-containing functional groups                           
              (potentially metal binding sites) are for ion transport and how                
              the rate of transport is affected by different functional                      
              groups.  A crown ether will be used to construct the central                   
              core of the macromolecule and cholesterol, attached by ester                   
              bonds, will be used for six side chains.                                       
                                                                                             
              This award will enable Dr. Frye, building on her experience in                 
              organic synthesis, to develop expertise in evaluation of ion                   
              transport across lipid bilayers.  If this initial project is                   
              successful, many additional projects will become viable and                    
              Frye will have established a new direction for her research                    
              career.
