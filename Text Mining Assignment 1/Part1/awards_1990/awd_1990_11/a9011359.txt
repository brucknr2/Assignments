Abstract    :
              A key element needed in robust control                                         
              and adaptive control is a reasonable                                           
              uncertainty bound.  An inadequate                                              
              uncertainty bound description will                                             
              cause analysis to be either overly                                             
              conservative or dangerously                                                    
              optimistic.  Despite this widely                                               
              appreciated fact, the problem of the                                           
              quantification of uncertainty has                                              
              received scant attention.  The                                                 
              research intends to develop a new                                              
              methodology for obtaining an estimate                                          
              of the true plant as well as a                                                 
              frequency upper bound on the                                                   
              uncertainty.  A starting point is the                                          
              adaptive quantification of                                                     
              uncertainties by rational                                                      
              approximation which combines                                                   
              identification, interpolation and                                              
              approximation nicely.  Preliminary                                             
              results show that the methods proposed                                         
              provide realistic bounds for the                                               
              uncertainty.  This encourages us to                                            
              believe that there is considerable                                             
              potential for further exploration.                                             
              The expected strategies for conducting                                         
              this research are outlined.  The                                               
              potential benefits and the                                                     
              implications of the expected results                                           
              are believed to be wide-ranging and                                            
              include new insights into the                                                  
              understanding and treatment of the                                             
              effects of the uncertainty,
