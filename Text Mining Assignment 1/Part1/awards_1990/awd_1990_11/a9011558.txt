Abstract    :
                   This research, conducted in India, explores how economic                  
              development affects gender inequalities and the social position                
              of women.  Official statistics are used to measure the gap be-                 
              tween males and females in (1) literacy rates and school gradua-               
              tion, (2) childhood mortality, (3) labor force participation, and              
              (4) occupational segregation.  These gaps tend to be large in                  
              northwest India and small in the south.  This geographical varia-              
              tion provides the opportunity to study causes of gender ine-                   
              qualities.   Data are analyzed from more than 300 Indian dis-                  
              tricts between 1961 and 1981.  The research examines how                       
              patterns of gender inequalities -- and changes in them  -- are                 
              related to growing industrialization, agricultural development,                
              and social infrastructure (schools and medical facilities).   A                
              by-product of this research will be the creation of a computer-                
              ized data base of district-level statistics usable by both U.S.                
              and Indian social scientists.
