Abstract    :
                   This project deals with a scientifically and technically                  
              important problem in sheet metal forming, namely the study of                  
              wrinkling in large panel forming.  The scientific content of the               
              project is comprised of two parts:  (1) understanding the                      
              mechanical behavior of anistropic materials used in sheet metal                
              forming and the development of constitutive relationship for such              
              materials, and (2) the study of instabilities in sheet forming                 
              due to wrinkling.
