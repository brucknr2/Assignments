Abstract    :
              The new quantum mechanics, discovered, elaborated and interpreted              
              during the crucial years 1925-1928, radically transformed the                  
              physics and philosophy of the 20th century.  Dr. Beller is                     
              examining the intellectual and social history of the quantum                   
              revolution as a multi-levelled and dynamic network of scientific               
              dialogues at that time.  She aims to incorpore the very fact of the            
              existence of the scientific community and the complex interaction              
              among its members into a basic level of the formation of scientific            
              knowledge.  She will describe how theoretical ideas and                        
              philosophical commitments took shape during the complex process of             
              negotiations.  This research will bring to light the experimental              
              aspect of the quantum revolution (1925-1928) and spell out the                 
              important impact of less central scientists, thus shedding light               
              on the collective aspect of scientific creativity.  Dr. Beller has             
              studied many primary and secondary sources in the history of                   
              quantum physics, and has published a series of papers on this                  
              topic.  Under this grant, she will examine additional primary                  
              documents available in the US and in archives in Austria and                   
              Germany.
