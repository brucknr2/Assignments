Abstract    :
              Biosensors employing enzymes or antibodies are capable of                      
              measuring a vast number of simple molecules as well as                         
              macromolecules involved in industrial bioprocesses.                            
              However, this capability cannot be tapped readily for                          
              bioreactor monitoring because enzymes and antibodies lose                      
              their activity during steam sterilization.  By making use                      
              of sterile fabrication methods and remote sensing                              
              technology, this proposal seeks to design and fabricate a                      
              prototype biosensor which can be used in bioreactors                           
              without the steam sterilization requirement.
