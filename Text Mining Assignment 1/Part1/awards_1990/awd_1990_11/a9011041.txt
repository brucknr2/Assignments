Abstract    :
                This research is to invert near-source waveforms of the Loma                 
              Prieta earthquake to determine the temporal and spatial behavior               
              of fault slip.  These data will be supplemented with records from              
              intermediate and teleseismic distances.  The methodology proposed              
              here is a frequency domain inversion method using a new norm                   
              minimization constraint that produces slip models characterized                
              by having the most nearly constant rupture velocity, and spatial               
              slip amplitude distribution, that are consistent with the data.                
              Source parameters such as hypocenter location, source time                     
              function, rupture front geometry and direction of propagation are              
              not predetermined, but solved for.  This research is a component               
              of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
