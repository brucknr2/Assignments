Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This study of photosynthetic pigments is directed at                           
              understanding the processes that control biological and                        
              chemical variability in the upper water column.  Observations                  
              will continue to be made on the distribution, transformation                   
              and degradation of photosynthetic pigments in the oceans.                      
              Research has emphasized:  1)  pigments as chemotaxonomic                       
              markers, 2)  physical-chemical-biological interactions in                      
              frontal areas, 3) photo-adaptation strategies of marine                        
              phytoplankton, and 4) grazing by zooplankton.  High performance                
              liquid chromatographic (HPLC) techniques have been used to                     
              quantify porphyrin and carotenoid distributions, zooplankton                   
              feeding selectivity, and differential rates of photosynthetic                  
              pigment synthesis.  These studies will continue in cooperation                 
              with investigators at WHOI, U Miami, UCSB and at laboratories                  
              in the Soviet Union.  The results of this research will have                   
              direct applications to issues in the U. S. JGOFS.
