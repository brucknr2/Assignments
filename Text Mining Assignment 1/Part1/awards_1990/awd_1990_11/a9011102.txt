Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is part of the NSF/USGS                                           
              initiative within the National Earthquake                                      
              Hazard Reduction Program (NEHRP) to                                            
              investigate the effects of the Loma Prieta                                     
              earthquake of 17 October 1989.  It concerns                                    
              the observed performance of six sanitary                                       
              landfills located within the Loma Prieta                                       
              earthquake damage zone.                                                        
                                                                                             
              Immediately following the Loma Prieta                                          
              earthquake, these landfills were inspected                                     
              for damage and evidence of slope movement,                                     
              and the observations recorded.  The                                            
              objectives of this research program are: (1)                                   
              to estimate the mean peak ground acceleration                                  
              that these landfills were subjected to during                                  
              the earthquake; (2) use these estimated                                        
              ground accelerations in a deformation                                          
              analysis; (3) compare the predicted                                            
              deformations with the observed conditions;                                     
              and (4) based upon this comparison, to assess                                  
              the validity of the input parameters and the                                   
              analytical techniques used.
