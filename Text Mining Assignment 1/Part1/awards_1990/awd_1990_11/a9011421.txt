Abstract    :
              This Research Initiation Award will support Dr. Chelberg's                     
              application of sensor modeling, Bayesian inference, utility                    
              theory, and real-time planning to problems of recognizing objects              
              in range imagery.  This approach to active computer vision is                  
              particularly appropriate for manufacturing, where object models                
              can be derived automatically from design-database information.                 
              Possible applications include sensor selection (or design), part               
              recognition, orientation determination, and bin picking.
