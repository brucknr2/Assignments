Abstract    :
              This Research Opportunities for Women Career Advancement Award                 
              is in the general area of inorganic chemistry.  Dr. Nita A.                    
              Lewis of the Chemistry Department of the University of Miami                   
              will study electron transfer in diferrocenes and                               
              4,4'-bipyridine-bridged ruthenium complexes under high pressure                
              conditions.  Because the intervalence charge transfer band of                  
              these species is solvent dependent, it is expected that high                   
              pressure measurements could yield information on the role of                   
              the solvent in electron transfer reactions.  Two graduate                      
              students will participate in the project.  Dr. Lewis has                       
              recently begun high pressure studies and this award will assist                
              her in pursuing her goal of establishing a laboratory for high                 
              pressure research in inorganic chemistry in the United States.
