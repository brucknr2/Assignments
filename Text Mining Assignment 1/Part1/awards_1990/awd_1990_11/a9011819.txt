Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is part of the NSF/USGS                                           
              initiative within the National Earthquake                                      
              Hazard Reduction Program (NEHRP) to                                            
              investigate the effects of the Loma Prieta                                     
              earthquake of 17 October 1989.  It continues                                   
              the research that was initiated the day                                        
              following the Loma Prieta earthquake, namely                                   
              to collect the perishable data on the seismic                                  
              performance of soil nailed walls in the San                                    
              Francisco Bay area.                                                            
                                                                                             
              Soil nailing is a construction procedure used                                  
              to shore vertical soil cuts for temporary or                                   
              permanent purposes.  Soil nailing differs                                      
              from conventional soldier pile and tie-back                                    
              shoring systems in many ways.  The technique                                   
              was first used in California in the San                                        
              Francisco area, where numerous temporary and                                   
              permanent walls have been constructed in the                                   
              past 5 to 6 years.  The major concern in                                       
              California with soil nailed walls is their                                     
              performance during earthquakes.                                                
                                                                                             
              The main objective of this follow-on project                                   
              is to analyze the data collected so as to                                      
              obtain a better understanding of the behavior                                  
              of soil nailed walls when subjected to                                         
              seismic forces.  Data collected following the                                  
              earthquake are being compared with the pre-                                    
              earthquake data to determine the changes in                                    
              the wall and soil movements, and in the nail                                   
              resistance.  The performance is being                                          
              evaluated with respect to soil conditions,                                     
              wall geometry and construction, and ground                                     
              motions.
