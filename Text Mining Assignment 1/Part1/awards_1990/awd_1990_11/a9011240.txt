Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The proposed work focusses upon how factors such as bulk                       
              concentration, particle shape and rigidity, and polydispersity                 
                                                                                             
              control the structure of thin films that are produced by the                   
                                                                                             
              adsorption of large particles from solution.  Although the                     
              primary thrust is on proteins and latex spheres, the results                   
                                                                                             
              should be of more general applicability.  The adsorption of                    
              many proteins is essentially irreversible, i.e. there is not                   
                                                                                             
              desorption or surface diffusion.  The situation is needed                      
              using the Random Sequential Adsorption (RSA) process.  It is                   
                                                                                             
              proposed to calculate the rate of adsorption, saturation                       
              coverage, and the structure of the film for several well                       
              defined models using computer simulation.  The results of this                 
                                                                                             
              study will assist in the design of processes to manufacture                    
              thin films with certain desired properties.
