Abstract    :
              This proposal is motivated by the desire to better                             
              understand blood flow in coronary arteries that contain                        
              more than one obstruction.  It is based on the premise                         
              that under pulsatile flow conditions the compliance of                         
              the upstream obstruction and the distance between the two                      
              obstructions strongly affect the pressure vs flow                              
              relationship in the artery.  Experimental observations on                      
              a flow-loop will be compared with predictions derived                          
              theoretically.  The project may yield new understanding                        
              of the development of multiple obstructions in coronary                        
              arteries, and may also lead to more incisive                                   
              interpretations of coronary angiograms.
