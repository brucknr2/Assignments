Abstract    :
              Duke University will purchase and ultra-highfield nuclear                      
              magnetic resonance spectrometer for advanced biochemical and                   
              chemical research.  Highfield NMR has become an indispensable                  
              tool for studies of macromolecules with experience showing that                
                                                                                             
              the most productive approaches involve a combination of                        
              advanced/methodologies and the highest magnetic fields available.              
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
              Basic scientists in six department will use one-and-two-                       
              dimensional NMR methods to study the solution structure and
