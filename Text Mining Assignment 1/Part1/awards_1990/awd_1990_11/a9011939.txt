Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                            
              The ways in which people influence one another has been a central              
              concern of social psychology since its inception.  For many                    
              years, research in this country has viewed social influence as                 
              the process by which the will of the majority is instilled into                
              the minority.  Recent European research has focused on the                     
              compliment of this idea, namely the ways in which the minority                 
              impacts upon the majority.  This research has produced some                    
              interesting and provocative deviations from the standard                       
              findings.  Considerable progress on minority influence has                     
              occurred in Europe.  In the US, knowledge about factors that                   
              influence social behavior has grown enormously, but very little                
              research has been done specifically on minority influence, which               
              appears to involve processes somewhat different from those                     
              involved in more standard majority influence situations.  The two              
              scientific communities in Europe and the US are in a unique                    
              position to contribute to one another in terms of theory,                      
              methods, and established research findings.  This proposal will                
              facilitate this process by allowing a group of America's best                  
              social influence researchers to meet in an intensive workshop                  
              with Europe's best.  The gains in theory and methodology should                
              be remarkable, and have long-term effects on social research in                
              America and Europe.  Understanding the factors that affect social              
              influence, of both majority and minority groups, on majority and               
              minority groups, has enormous theoretical and practical                        
              implications.  This research should foster this process of                     
              understanding.
