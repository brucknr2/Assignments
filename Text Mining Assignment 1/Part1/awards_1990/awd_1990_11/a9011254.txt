Abstract    :
              The Boolean satisfiability method for testing combinational circuits           
              generates test patterns in two steps.  First, it constructs a formula          
              expressing the Boolean difference between the unfaulted and faulted            
              circuits.  Second, it applies a Boonlean satisfiability algorithm to the       
              resulting formula.  This differs from most current approaches to testing       
              which directly search the circuit data structure.  This method has been        
              shown to be effective in identifying defective combinational circuits          
              when the defects can be modeled by the single stuck at fault model.            
              This research is extending the Boolean satisfiability method to handle         
              a wide variety of nonclassical faults.  Modifications to the method to         
              detect bridging and delay faults are being investigated.
