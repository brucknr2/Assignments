Abstract    :
                   Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will                  
              use the lattice (discrete space-time) approach to the strong                   
              nuclear force and to simplified models of it to try to                         
              understand why quarks are confined inside the "elementary"                     
              particles such as nucleons.  There will also be an attempt to                  
              overcome technical problems blocking the efficient use of                      
              numerical techniques in studies of the strong force.  The                      
              achievement of an understanding of quark confinement is a                      
              challenge of fundamental importance, and the overcoming of                     
              present technical obstacles in numerical studies of the strong                 
              force is necessary for progress in this field.
