Abstract    :
              Addressing issues of bounded rationality in economics has long been            
              recognized as an important yet difficult problem.  There has been              
              a tremendous increase in research on complexity and bounded                    
              rationality in game theory due to the application of the notion of             
              an automaton from computer science to problems in economics.  This             
              project can be divided into three areas: (1) continuing work on                
              automation complexity but with a major focus on stochastic Bayesian            
              games (repeated games with incomplete information); (2)                        
              applications of complexity analysis to economics; and (3)                      
              investigations of some new methods of bounding complexity in                   
              extensive games.                                                               
                                                                                             
              The project will make important methodological contributions.  The             
              work on stochastic Bayesian games is important because it allows               
              rigorous studies of decision making with differential private                  
              information.  The research will contribute to our understanding of             
              important and as yet unresolved issues such as the scope of                    
              equilibria attainable by bounded players, rule rationality versus              
              full rationality, Bayesian updating by bounded players, and                    
              language and complexity.  The project will apply strategic-                    
              complexity analysis to such important economic problems as market              
              segmentation and the design of coordination of complex                         
              organizations using many bounded players.
