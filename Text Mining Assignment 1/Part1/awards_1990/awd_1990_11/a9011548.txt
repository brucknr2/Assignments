Abstract    :
                   This research addresses the analysis of nonlinear hyperbolic              
              partial differential equations, with applications to wave                      
              propagation in a variety of physical contexts.  The analysis is                
              based on the systematic reduction of complex systems of equations              
              to simpler model equations by means of asymptotic equations.                   
              The model equations are studied using a combination of explicit                
              solutions, perturbation methods, qualitative analysis, and                     
              numerical calculations.                                                        
                   The research lies in the general area of applied                          
              mathematics.  Physical systems in which disturbances propagate at              
              finite speeds are often modelled by hyperbolic partial                         
              differential equations.  Examples include compressible gas flows,              
              elasticity, magnetohydrodynamics, and general relativity.  When                
              the speed of the disturbance depends on the strength of the                    
              disturbance, the equations are nonlinear.  An outstanding                      
              property of nonlinear hyperbolic waves is the formation of                     
              shocks.  Shock waves are of significant practical importance                   
              (e.g. in sonic booms or the nonsurgical destruction of kidney                  
              stones) and pose many challenging mathematical problems.
