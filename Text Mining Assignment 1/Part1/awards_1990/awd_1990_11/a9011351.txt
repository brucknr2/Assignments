Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will support the research of three cultural                         
              anthropologists in Antarctica, studying how an extreme and                     
              isolated environment affects group structure and individuals'                  
              understanding of that structure.  The incidence and management of              
              conflict will be studied as it is, in turn, affected by the group              
              structure.  Both quantitative and qualitative data will be                     
              collected on the formation of group structure, status and role                 
              consensus, perceived conflict and morale for three groups at the               
              Amundsen-Scott  South Pole station.  Quantitative models of the                
              formation of group structure will be created.                                  
                                                                                             
              This study will contribute to our understanding of the role of                 
              group structure and cognition in the functioning of groups in                  
              isolation, will complement work on health and adaptation in polar              
              environments, and provide important information that will help                 
              develop improved procedures to assemble groups for the Antarctic               
              and other isolated environments (e.g., space stations).
