Abstract    :
                   With this proposal the principal investigator will continue               
              his analysis of mathematical models of certain polymers and                    
              metals in order to predict the failure of these materials when                 
              external forces are applied.  The mathematical models come from                
              the theories of nonlinear elasticity and viscoelasticity, and                  
              their analysis involves the study of singular solutions of                     
              hyperbolic and elliptic systems and the use of techniques from                 
              the calculus of variations.                                                    
                   The most common way of testing when a polymer or metal will               
              fail under the influence of an external force is to subject the                
              actual material to loading until it breaks or deforms.  This is                
              fine if one is interested only in the gross properties of the                  
              material, but if one wants to understand why the material fails                
              at a given load then one must have recourse to mathematical                    
              models of the material.  In this grant the principal investigator              
              will use advanced mathematics to uncover the mechanisms of                     
              failure and fracture in polymers and metals by examining systems               
              of partial differential equations from the theory of                           
              viscoelasticity.
