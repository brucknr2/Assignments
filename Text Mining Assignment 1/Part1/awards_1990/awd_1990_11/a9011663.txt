Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Andrews LTER 1 and 2 programs consisted of long-term field                     
              experiments and observation programs on disturbance regimes,                   
              vegetation succession, trophic interactions, forest/stream                     
              interactions, and controls on primary production, decomposition,               
              and nutrient cycling.  These studies will be continued in LTER 3               
              (1991-1996).  In addition, synthesis efforts, initiated in LTER 1              
              and 2, will be expanded greatly.  Long-term records of climate,                
              stream flow and chemistry, tree growth and mortality, along with               
              Andrews-wide data on fire history and geomorphic disturbance                   
              regime, will be used to develop and verify models of stand- and                
              landscape-level response of the forest/stream ecosystem to                     
              natural disturbance (wildfire), land use (conversion of natural                
              to intensively managed forest), and climate warming.  This work,               
              some of its underway, is made possible by collaboration with                   
              other LTER sites (e.g. VCR, CPR, NWT) and Federal agencies (USGS-              
              Denver, EPA-Corvallis).  Emphasis will also continue on data                   
              management, LTER network and intersite activities, and                         
              dissemination of research results to the public.  Andrews LTER                 
              research is highly relevant to major issues concerning natural                 
              resource management in the Pacific Northwest and in other regions              
              of rapid land-use change.                                                      
                                                                                             
              This is an excellent research team that has assumed a leadership               
              position in the LTER program.  Institutional support for this                  
              project is excellent.
