Abstract    :
              With this grant in the Theoretical and Computational Program of                
              the Chemistry Division, Professor Cave will involve                            
              undergraduates at his RUI institution in performing                            
              calculations on how the properties of molecules change when                    
              they are excited by interaction with ultraviolet light.                        
                                                                                             
              Two newly developed correlation methods will be used to                        
              calculate excitation energies and potential energy curves for a                
              variety of systems where significant mixing of zeroth order                    
              states is encountered in excited states.  Three classes of                     
              systems will be studied: Rydberg states of homonuclear and                     
              heteronuclear diatomic molecules; reactions of electronically                  
              excited zinc with atomic and molecular partners; and polyene                   
              cations and cyclic conjugated species.  Comparison will be made                
              between configuration interaction treatments of excited states                 
              and the two newly developed correlation methods.
