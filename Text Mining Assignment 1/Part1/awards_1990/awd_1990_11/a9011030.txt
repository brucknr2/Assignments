Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A major ecologically important group of marine animals are the                 
              jellyfish, or cnidarians.  They form a major part of the drifting              
              animals living near the ocean surface, and different species show              
              different selection of prey animals on which they feed.                        
              Jellyfish capture their prey animals by using the stinging cells               
              (cnidocytes) in the tentacles only when the prey comes into                    
              contact with the jellyfish.  So the observed selective feeding on              
              either fish or crustaceans requires some sensory mechanism for                 
              the jellyfish to distinguish prey.  This study will use modern                 
              neurophysiological techniques of patch-clamping on the stinging                
              cells, and address the important question of whether there is                  
              some chemosensory regulation of release of the stingers.  The                  
              impact of this Career Advancement Award will enhance Dr. Jennifer              
              Purcell's career capability significantly, and results will be                 
              important to chemosensory science, animal behavior, neurobiology,              
              and marine biology.
