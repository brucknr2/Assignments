Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The development and investigation of high strength reinforced                  
              concrete applications comprises a major advance in building                    
              planning and design because of its increased capacities.  The                  
              present state of high strength reinforced concrete design                      
              needs in-depth study to accurately predict the anticipated                     
              performance of its many component parts under dynaic lateral                   
              loading such as earthquake loads.  High strength reinforced                    
              concrete is also a sophisticated and complex building material                 
              due to the large number of design and construction constraints                 
              which influence its quality, long term behavior, and final                     
              stress values.  In order to more accurately model its                          
              structural response, it is necessary to develop a fundamental                  
              data-base of performance standards.                                            
                                                                                             
              The proposed project is concerned with the development of                      
              design and detailing criteria for transverse reinforcement in                  
              high rectangular columns with compressive strengths exceeding                  
              15,000 psi.  Its objectives are to determine methods to                        
              provide sufficient ductility for earthquake-resistant                          
              structures.  The research plan includes both experimental and                  
              analytical studies.  At least twelve large-scale column                        
              specimens will be tested and be subjected to axial and                         
              repeated lateral loads at increasing displacements.  From                      
              these tests, data will be collected for the analytical                         
              documentation of the effects of concrete compressive strength,                 
              axial load, and types of transverse reinforcement on the                       
              ductility of high strength concrete columns.
