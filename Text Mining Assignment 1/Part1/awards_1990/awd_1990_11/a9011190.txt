                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
                  The research is part of an ongoing project investigating                  
              word order among the languages of the world.  The goals of the                 
              project are: (1) to establish a large cross-linguistic data base               
              on word order that will be made available to other linguists; (2)              
              to investigate the ways in which word order characteristics                    
              correlate with each other; (3) to test universal hypotheses about              
              word order; (4) to examine possible explanations for word order                
              correlations and universals; and (5) to investigate the                        
              geographical and genetic distribution of word order                            
              characteristics.                                                               
                                                                                             
                   In the earlier phases of the project, data has been                       
              collected for a variety of word order parameters, morpheme                     
              position parameters, and a few other typological parameters from               
              a total of 603 languages.  The primary goal of this phase is to                
              attempt to fill in a variety of different gaps in the data base,               
              to collect data on a number of additional parameters, and to                   
              produce a book that describes the basic results of the project                 
              and makes the data base available for the use of other linguists.
