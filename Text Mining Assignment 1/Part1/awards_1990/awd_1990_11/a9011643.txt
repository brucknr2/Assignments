Abstract    :
              This award supports an Antarctic Geophysical Working Group.                    
              The Division of Polar Programs has instituted a new                            
              geophysical effort aimed at achieving a quantum step forward                   
              in understanding the structure and evolution of the                            
              antarctic lithosphere.  In parallel, the Scientific                            
              Committee for Antarctic Research (SCAR)  Group of                              
              Specialists is developing plans for a major geotraverse                        
              across the Antarctic continent.  U.S. scientists are heavily                   
              involved in this SCAR initiative.  The Antarctic Geophysical                   
              Working Group will provide a focus for U.S. efforts in these                   
              areas and for participation in international research aimed                    
              at understanding the relationship between Antarctic crustal                    
              evolution and ice sheet history.
