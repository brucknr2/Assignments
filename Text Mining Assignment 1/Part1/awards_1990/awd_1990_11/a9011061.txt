Abstract    :
              This award will provide supplementary support to enable Dr. Leigh              
              Chinitz of the University of Virginia to conduct collaborative                 
              research for 18 months with Dr. Kazuo Abe of the National Laboratory           
              for High Energy Physics (KEK) in Tsukuba, Japan.  They will study              
              TRISTAN electron-positron collider ring.                                       
                                                                                             
              The great success of the Standard Model of strong and electro-weak             
              interactions at describing many types of phenomena over a broad                
              range in momentum makes it imperative that this model be subjected             
              to rigorous tests, and any deviations from the model be closely                
              inspected.  Currently, the AMY group is seeing several experimental            
              anomalies.  Using Monte Carlo techniques, the P.I. will attempt to             
              explain the AMY results using the Standard Model.  This collabora-             
              tion will allow Dr. Chinitz to collaborate with a team of physicists           
              at KEK working at the cutting edge of their field.
