Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This study focuses on the development of depositional sequences                
              and sedimentary cycles in deep-water continental margin                        
              carbonates in order to:  1)  determine the controls of climatic,               
              sea level, and oceanographic changes on evolution of slope                     
              carbonate sequences; 2)  compare climatically-meditated                        
              sedimentary cycles within and outside the influence of vigorous                
              geostrophic currents; and 3)  compare modern deep-water ramps                  
              with ancient carbonate sequences for paleoenvironmental                        
              interpretations.  Material from DSDP sites on the Campeche ramp                
              off Yucatan peninsula will be used for this purpose.  The study                
              eill resolve the role of oceanographic setting in generation of                
              deep-water carbonate cycles.  The nearly pure carbonate ramp                   
              slope of Campeche Bank may provide a modern analog for the                     
              development of limestone sequences inthe rock record.
