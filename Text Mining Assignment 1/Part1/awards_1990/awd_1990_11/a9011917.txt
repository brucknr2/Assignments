Abstract    :
              This project will study inference in simultaneous nonlinear                    
              error-in-variables models - identification, estimation,                        
              prediction and specification testing. The linkages between                     
              identifiability and nonlinearities in the measurement error model              
              will be studied and appropriate sufficient identifiability                     
              conditions analyzed. The consequences of measurement errors on                 
              standard procedures for testing hypotheses, estimation and                     
              validation in nonlinear models will be studied. Parametric and                 
              semiparametric procedures are established for the estimation of                
              nonlinear error-in-variables models. Modifications of Monte Carlo              
              and residual-based stochastic simulations are developed to handle              
              measurement error problems and adapted to not only prediction but              
              also estimation and specification testing. The large-sample                    
              asymptotic theory for these procedures will be developed.                      
                                                                                             
              Particular attention is given to the treatment of the measurement              
              error generating process. The standard Gaussian white nose model               
              for measurement errors is the starting point for the analysis.                 
              Analysis then continues to less restrictive and more appropriate               
              measurement error models which are nonlinear and non-Gaussian.                 
              Simultaneous systems with limited dependent variables are used                 
              for a more specific examination of the applicability of the new                
              techniques.
