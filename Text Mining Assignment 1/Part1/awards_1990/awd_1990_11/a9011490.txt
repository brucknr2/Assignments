Abstract    :
                   Spray forming process offers a great potential for near-net               
              shape manufacturing of metal-matrix composites.  A special                     
              experimental system will be developed to investigate the effects               
              of process variables such as droplet size, velocity, temperature               
              history, undercooling and impingement surface condition on the                 
              formed geometry, microstructure and yield.  Also investigated                  
              will be the effects of splat phenomena and inclusion of                        
              reinforcing particulates on the resulting microstructures.                     
              Several hypothesis on the solidification mechanism will be                     
              examined, and the results will be incorporated into available                  
              mathematical processing models.
