Abstract    :
                This research is to obtain an estimate of the Loma Prieta                    
              earthquake rupture process first by analyzing the teleseismic                  
              records and then by simulating strong-motion seismograms.  Using               
              records from the new NSF/IRIS PASSCAL seismic instruments that                 
              were installed in the aftershock area, the research will involve               
              analysis of aftershock activity including determination of                     
              crustal structure near the source region.  This research is a                  
              component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
