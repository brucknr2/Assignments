Abstract    :
              In this project, the P.I.'s will continue numerical and analytical             
              studies of the propagation and evolution of strong oceanic                     
              vortices in the presence of horizontal and vertical shears,                    
              explore mixing by mesoscale vortices and strong eddies, and                    
              examine the influence of vertical mixing driven by surface heat                
              fluxes on oceanic eddies.
