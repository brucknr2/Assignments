Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a post-event investigation project to learn                            
              engineering lessons from the Loma Prieta earthquake (October                   
              1989).                                                                         
                                                                                             
              The objective of this project, conducted in companion between                  
              the University of Texas (UT) and the H. J. Degenkolb                           
              Associates (HJD) is to study the performance of industrial                     
              buildings and their contents during the Loma Prieta                            
              earthquake.  The primary focus will be on facilities in high-                  
              tech industries.  The data gathered will be used to examine                    
              structural design criteria associated with providing safety                    
              and life.  The requirements that should be given to                            
              maintenance of operations when designing or retrofitting a                     
              structure will be defined quantitatively.                                      
                                                                                             
              The investigation will involve three major tasks:    (1) A                     
              field study of damaged buildings/contents and the work done                    
              to restore operations, including cost data by (HJD and UT),                    
              (2) Gather details of selected existing structures to                          
              determine problem areas and to evaluate the redesigns actually                 
              used or those proposed for the structure (HJD and UT) and (3)                  
              for selected structures, conduct detailed analyses of the                      
              existing and redesigned structures using models based on                       
              available test data for strengthened or repaired structural                    
              elements (by UT).                                                              
                                                                                             
              It is anticipated that the project will make access to data,                   
              determine feasibility of retrofitting to standards, result in                  
              improved understanding of vulnerability of critical                            
              industries, and identify long-term experimental and analytical                 
              research needs for operation maintaining and rapid post-event                  
              recovery.
