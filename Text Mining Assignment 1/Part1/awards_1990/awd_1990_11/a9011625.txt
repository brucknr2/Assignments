Abstract    :
              Dr. Parshall is continuing her research on a biography of                      
              James Joseph Sylvester (1814-1897).  Sylvester was one of the                  
              major figures of 19th century mathematics.  As a key developer                 
              of the British school of invariant theory, he thrust Great                     
              Britain back into the thick of international mathematical                      
              competition.  As the first professor of mathematics at the                     
              Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, he brought research-                    
              level mathematics to the United States.                                        
                                                                                             
              Under this grant, Dr. Parshall is undertaking two separate                     
              projects designed to detail and clarify further Sylvester's                    
              place in the history of mathematics.  First, she is continuing                 
              her work with Paul Wolfson on the history of invariant theory.                 
              They are focusing on the period from Gordan's proof of the                     
              finiteness theorem in 1869 through Hilbert's complete                          
              generalization of it in 1893, and then tracing the impact of                   
              Hilbert's ideas on the area during the ensuing three decades.                  
              Second, she is completing a volume of selected Sylvester                       
              correspondence with historical and mathematical commentary.                    
              These two projects will serve to fill in the gaps which                        
              emerged as a result of the PI's prior research on Sylvester                    
              and will allow her to complete her biographical study of                       
              Sylvester's life, work and times.
