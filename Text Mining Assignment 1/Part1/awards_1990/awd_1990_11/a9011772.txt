              ABSTRACT                                                                        
                  This is a study of solar and solar wind magnetohydrodynamics              
              (MHD). Four basic areas will be emphasized; (1) coronal processes              
              of 3D reconnection, (2) Alfven wave absorption and turbulence,                 
              (3) instability and turbulence in coronal mass ejections, and                  
              (4) the theory of fast dynamo action and the modelling of the                  
              alpha-effect. These problems are important for understanding                   
              flares, coronal heating, the solar wind and the solar cycle.                   
              Earlier work concentrated on ideal and resistive MHD                           
              instabilities in line-tied solar coronal loops, and showed, in                 
              nonlinear MHD simulations, that the instabilities cause current                
              sheets to form.  Also studied was Alfven wave resonant                         
              absorption in coronal flux tubes driven by photospheric motion.                
              The current work will concentrate on current sheets, 3D                        
              reconnection, and possible singularities of 3D equilibria in                   
              solar coronal magnetic loops. Secondary Kelvin-Helmholtz                       
              instabilities in Alfven waves and other absorption mechanisms                  
              will also be studied. MHD instabilities and dynamics of coronal                
              mass ejection models will be investigated, and the fast dynamo                 
              analyses will be expanded to encompass steady flows with chaotic               
              webs, and time dependent flows which are close to integrable                   
              flows.  The effort will include new methods for calculating                    
              transport by chaotic flow, and the graphical representation of                 
              magnetic structures produced by dynamos.  *** //
