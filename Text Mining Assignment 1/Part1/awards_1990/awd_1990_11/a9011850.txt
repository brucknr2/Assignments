Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research of Professor V. Rodl to                  
              work in the theory of hereditary classes and Euclidean Ramsey                  
              theory. Rodl will work on structural Ramsey type theorems on set               
              systems, vector spaces and their combinatorial analogues such as               
              parameter words and lattices. He will also work on the                         
              quantitative aspects by attempting to evaluate the size and                    
              numbers of the corresponding objects                                           
                   The research falls into the general area of combinatorics.                
              This is at the same time one of the oldest yet one of the most                 
              active areas of mathematics.  Combinatorics attempts to find                   
              efficient methods to study how discrete collections of objects                 
              can be organized.  And, so it is extremely important to modern                 
              communications.
