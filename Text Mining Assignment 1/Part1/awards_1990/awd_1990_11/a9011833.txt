Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The PI proposes to unify and distribute enhancements of the                    
              seismic processing package SIOSEIS. Marine geologists and                      
              geophysicists from eleven universitites actively use SEIOSEIS                  
              as a tool in the analysis of diverse geologic porblems even                    
              though they use different computer and plotter                                 
              manufacturers.The variety of data types and analysis techniques                
              has led to several groups making separate enhancements that                    
              they are willing to share with all SIOSEIS users. This award                   
              will integrate many of these enhancements and make them                        
              available to the entire community.
