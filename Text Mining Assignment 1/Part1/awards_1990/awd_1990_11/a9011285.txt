Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a post-event investigation project to learn                            
              engineering lessons from the Loma Prieta earthquake (October                   
              1989).                                                                         
                                                                                             
              The Loma Prieta earthquake has produced important information                  
              on performance of engineered structures subjected to strong                    
              ground shaking.  The strong-motion data generated from the                     
              instrumented buildings provide a unique opportunity to further                 
              advance the knowledge about the seismic behavior and                           
              resistance of buildings and to develop improved methodologies                  
              for their design.  Three steel and composite building                          
              structures have been selected for detailed studies in this                     
              project.  One suffered serious structural damage, another                      
              experienced excessive sway motion, and the third showed                        
              excellent performance.  Two main research tasks will be                        
              conducted.  The first is to perform analytical calculations                    
              to study the seismic response of these buildings using the                     
              recorded motions at their basement and to correlate the                        
              analytical results with the recorded responses at the upper                    
              levels.  For the seriously damaged building inelastic time-                    
              history analyses will also be carried out.  The second task                    
              is to develop retrofit or strengthening schemes to improve the                 
              seismic performance of the damaged building and the building                   
              experiencing excessive dynamic motion.                                         
                                                                                             
              The study will improve the understanding of seismic behavior                   
              of steel structures based on the performance data during a                     
              major earthquake.
