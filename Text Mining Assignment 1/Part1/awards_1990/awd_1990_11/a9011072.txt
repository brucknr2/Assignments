Abstract    :
              This work aims to continue a variety of studies all related to                 
              magnetism, superconductivity, and electron spin resonance.                     
              Proposed research topics include critical exponents for quasi-two              
              dimensional systems and ordered state resonance for layered                    
              magnetic materials; stacked linear oligomers; bound magnon                     
              contributions to the thermodynamics of S=1/2 Heisenberg-Ising                  
              Ferromagnets; superconductivity; and proton glasses.
