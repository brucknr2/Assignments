Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary mechanism by which steroids exert their                            
              widespread effects is by altering the rate of synthesis of                     
              proteins within target cells.  Testosterone, the major androgenic              
              steroid, is secreted by the testes into the blood stream and                   
              readily enters cells by diffusion.  Specific protein receptors                 
              are located in hormone responsive cells, such as hypothalamic                  
              neurons in the brain.  Once the testosterone enters a target                   
              neuron, the receptors bind the hormone.  The steroid receptor                  
              complexes then act on its genes to alter the expression of                     
              proteins.  Dr. McGinnis will identify the proteins that are                    
              increased or decreased by testosterone within specific brain                   
              regions.  In addition, she will determine how the altered                      
              neuronal properties produce behavioral and physiological changes.              
              The results of these studies will be useful in devising molecular              
              approaches to understanding androgen.regulated functions.                      
              Moreover, the findings may have clinical ramifications since they              
              may prove useful in providing insight into the treatments of                   
              hormone dependent tumors, neurologic diseases influenced by                    
              androgens as well as male sterility.
