Abstract    :
                   The John Day Formation of the Pacific Northwest includes                  
              volcanic deposits interlayered with terrestrial strata, in which               
              plants and animals from the Tertiary Epoch are preserved.  The                 
              Condon Museum of the University of Oregon houses more than 32,000              
              fossil vertebrates from the John Day beds of Oregon, as well as                
              plant and invertebrate fossils that cover a wider spectrum of                  
              geologic ages.  This collection ranks as an important resource                 
              for paleontological research, and Dr. William Orr, Curator of the              
              collection, proposes significant improvements in its condition.                
              The collection will be installed in high density compactorized                 
              storage units in newly renovated quarters, and will be                         
              inventoried and reorganized in the process.  A computer database               
              of the collection's contents will be implemented, thereby                      
              providing the research community with better access to these                   
              important fossils.                                                             
                   Regionally important collections such as the Condon Museum                
              are critical elements of the nation's research infrastructure.                 
              They provide easier access by researchers and students within the              
              region, and they support advanced training in systematics,                     
              ecology, and evolutionary biology.  These and other advantages                 
              would be lost if regional collections were to be subsumed into a               
              few national repositories.  The proposed collection improvement                
              will enhance important paleontological research and graduate                   
              training, and preserve part of our nation's natural heritage.
