Abstract    :
              This award from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic                 
              Chemistry Program and the Biochemistry Program provides the                    
              third year of a three-year continuing grant to support the work                
              of Dr. Jacqueline K. Barton of the California Institute of                     
              Technology. In collaboration with Dr. Lawrence A. Chasin of                    
              Columbia University, Dr. Barton will evaluate the usefulness of                
              chiral metal complexes as probes of the secondary structure of                 
              DNA. Such metal complexes have proven useful in identifying                    
              segments of DNA with altered conformations, such as the                        
              so-called Z-DNA and cruciform DNA.
