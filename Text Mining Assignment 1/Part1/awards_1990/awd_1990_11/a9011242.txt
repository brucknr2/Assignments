Abstract    :
              The motivation for research on self-propagating high                           
              temperature synthesis (solid combustion) has been largely                      
              based upon materials considerations, but many of the                           
              unresolved problems are directly or indirectly related to heat                 
              and mass transfer issues.  Temperature-related wave                            
              characteristics are governed, in part, by the thermal                          
              conductivity, diffusivity, and specific heat of the reactants                  
              and products of combustion.  The research, which is to be                      
              performed cooperatively with the Institute of Structural                       
              Macrokinetics in Chernogolovka, USSR, consists of three                        
              experimental activities:  investigations of the effect of                      
              melting on combustion synthesis of refractory metal carbides,                  
              investigations of nonuniform combustion fronts in the                          
              filtration combustion synthesis of nitrides, and investigation                 
              of the propagation of combustion waves through compositional                   
              gradients.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              Fundamental studies are needed to provide a thorough                           
              understanding of the mechanisms of direct combustion                           
              synthesis.  The apparent complexity of the process has                         
              generated only a reserved optimism on the future of the                        
              technique with US industry.  A research effort coordinated                     
              with the Soviet Union, under the guidelines of the US-USSR                     
              Cooperation in the Field of Basic Scientific Research Program,                 
              will lead to a higher likelihood of understanding the                          
              combustion process in synthesis reactions through                              
              investigations of the evolving temperature wave.
