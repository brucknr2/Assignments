Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a post-event investigation project to learn                            
              engineering lessons from the Loma Prieta earthquake (October                   
              1989)                                                                          
                                                                                             
              The Loma Prieta earthquake data will be used to develop a new                  
              response spectrum method for analysis of bridges and other                     
              multyply supported structures that are subjected to                            
              differential ground motion.  A frequency dependent correlation                 
              model for the support motions of the Bay Bridge, accounting                    
              for the effects of traveling waves, attenuation, propogation                   
              path, and local soil and geologic structures will be                           
              constructed and calibrated.  This function will be applied to                  
              the response spectrum analysis based on the principles of                      
              stochastic processes.                                                          
                                                                                             
              The new response spectrum method will be used to investigate                   
              the response of the Bay Bridge during the Loma Prieta                          
              earthquake and to determine the causes of its failure.                         
              Special emphasis will be given to determining the influence                    
              of differential support motions on the observed performance                    
              of the bridge.  The results from this anlysis will be compared                 
              with planned time-history analysis of the bridge by a separate                 
              research team at Berkeley, thus verifying the response                         
              spectrum method.  The method will then be used to predict the                  
              response of the Ba Bridge to a potential earthquake of large                   
              magnitude on San Andreas or Hayward faults.  This part will                    
              be carried out in parallel with other planned studies of the                   
              Bay Bridge at the Universit of California at Berkeley.                         
                                                                                             
              The investigation will advance the methodology for analyzing                   
              the bridge response to multiple-support seismic excitations.
