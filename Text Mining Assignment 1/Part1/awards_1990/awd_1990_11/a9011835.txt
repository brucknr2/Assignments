Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research project concentrates on the biology of the                       
              hydrothermal vent tubeworm, Riftia pachyptila.  This animal                    
              contains symbiotic chemoautotrophic bacteria which appear to                   
              supply all of the nutrition for this gutless host.  It is the                  
              only member of the phyla Vestimentifera and Pogonophora                        
              accessible for detailed ecophysiological studies.                              
                                                                                             
              Studies will concentrate on the ways this species is able to                   
              utilize the inorganic carbon dioxide of the surrounding sea water              
              to produce directly a major portion of the biomass of this                     
              community.  The 3 major research areas to be investigated are: a)              
              metabolic pathways involved in the transport of carbon dioxide                 
              from the plume to the symbiotic bacteria in the trophosome, b)                 
              the excretion of reduced organic compounds by the symbionts, and               
              c) the possible role of bacterial cell wall material in the                    
              transfer of carbon to the host.                                                
                                                                                             
              To accomplish these research goals studies will utilize whole                  
              animals maintained in high pressure aquaria immediately after                  
              collection, perfused tissue preparations, and purified symbiotic               
              bacteria.  The main tool used in this research is incubation with              
              radioactive markers (and sometimes metabolic inhibitors) with a                
              subsequent identification of the metabolites in which these                    
              markers have been incorporated.
