Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              To examine the role of nerve growth factor (NGF) in the formation              
              of specific connections in vivo, the investigator recently                     
              developed a transgenic mouse line in which there is overexpres-                
              sion of NGF in the pancreas.  The overexpression of NGF in                     
              specific regions of the pancreas is correlated with large                      
              increases in the synaptic density of sympathetic innervation in                
              these regions.  This transgenic line will now be used to study                 
              the development of synapses employing immunocytochemistry for a                
              synapse-specific molecule, synapsin.  The pancreas and the celiac              
              ganglion of adult control and transgenic mice will also be                     
              immunocytochemically stained for beta-amyloid, which has been                  
              demonstrated to increase in response to NGF.  Studies of the                   
              ganglion using this antibody will reveal the ganglionic neurons                
              that project to the islets and indicate consequences of this                   
              chronic exposure in vivo for their development, maintenance and                
              possibly, their degeneration.  In addition, new transgenic mice                
              will be created in which there is overexpression of NGF in the                 
              central nervous system.  These mice will be used to determine                  
              whether there are important differences between the peripheral                 
              and central nervous systems in the balance of trophic factors                  
              regulating synaptogenesis.
