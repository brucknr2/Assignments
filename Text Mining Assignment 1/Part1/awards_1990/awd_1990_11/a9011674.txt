Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a part of the coordinated research program in                          
              prestressed structural systems.  In order to study the                         
              behavior of the two broad types of connection type, a flexible                 
              analytical platform will be developed.  This platform will be                  
              an extension of the computer analysis program DRAIN 2D-X to                    
              accommodate the development of three-dimensional elements, to                  
              include slaving constraints and to enhance presently available                 
              pre-and post-processing tools while refining current                           
              procedures for the nonlinear static and dynamic analysis of                    
              structures.  Special purpose elements will also be developed.                  
              These will be based on physical fiber models and will permit                   
              various levels of analysis sophistication.  Significant part                   
              of the total effort will be directed towards documenting the                   
              analytical procedures which underlie the analytical platform                   
              in order to facilitate the inclusion of special purpose                        
              elements by other program participants.  Documentation will                    
              also be provided to guide other participants and users in the                  
              use of the program.                                                            
                                                                                             
              This project will develop the basic analytical capability                      
              necessary to carry out all the studies involved in the overall                 
              seismic precast structure research program.
