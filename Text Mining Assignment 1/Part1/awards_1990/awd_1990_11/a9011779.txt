Abstract    :
              The research comprises an analytical and experimental study of                 
              hyper-redundant mechanisms.  Hyper-redundant mechanisms are defined            
              as highly articulated devices with a large or infinite number of               
              degrees of freedom, and are analogous to snakes, elephant trunks,              
              tentacles, etc.  These devices have potential applications in                  
              robotic manipulation and locomotion, as well as many other non                 
              robotics applications such as articulated space structures, medical            
              endoscopes, and flagellum like fluid propulsion.  This                         
              investigation focuses on basic geometric, kinematic, dynamic and               
              control issues related to hyper-redundant mechanisms.  The                     
              analytical phase focuses on a differential geometry based approach             
              to the kinematic analysis and geometric control of this class of               
              mechanisms.  In the experimental phase, a planar hyper-redundant               
              device will be implemented in hardware and algorithms developed in             
              the theoretical study will be tested and verified.
