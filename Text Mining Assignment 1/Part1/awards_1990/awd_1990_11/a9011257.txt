Abstract    :
              This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                      
              continuing work of Dr. Kenneth B. Wiberg at Yale University.                   
              The results of this investigation will provide new insights                    
              into the ways that chemical reactivity is dependent on                         
              molecular structure.                                                           
                                                                                             
              The experiments that will be carried out by Professor Wiberg                   
              will focus on the chemical and physical properties of                          
              unactivated carbon-carbon bonds in small-ring hydrocarbons.                    
              New and unusual small-ring compounds will be synthesized, and                  
              their reactivities will be examined using kinetic and tracer                   
              studies.  Spectroscopic methods will be used to study the                      
              influence of bond angle deformations and substituent effects,                  
              and theoretical calculations will be employed to obtain                        
              detailed information on the origins of the observed properties                 
              for ground-state species and reactive intermediates.
