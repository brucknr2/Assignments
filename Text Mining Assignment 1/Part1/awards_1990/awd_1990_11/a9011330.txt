              This project is part of the NSF/USGS                                           
              initiative within the National Earthquake                                      
              Hazard Reduction Program (NEHRP) to                                            
              investigate the effects of the Loma Prieta                                     
              earthquake of 17 October 1989.                                                 
                                                                                             
              The strong ground motions recorded in the San                                  
              Francisco Bay Area during the Loma Prieta                                      
              earthquake exceeded the levels predicted by                                    
              standard empirical attenuation relations.  A                                   
              preliminary analysis of these records                                          
              suggests that this may have been a result of                                   
              critical reflections of the seismic waves                                      
              from the base of the crust.                                                    
                                                                                             
              The objective of this proposal is to perform                                   
              further analyses and simulations using an                                      
              expanded data base that includes recordings                                    
              of other events of the earthquake sequence in                                  
              order to rigorously test this and other                                        
              explanations for the large ground motions                                      
              observed.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              Evaluating the cause of this observed                                          
              departure from predicted levels of ground                                      
              motion has important implications for                                          
              estimating ground motions from future large                                    
              earthquakes on the San Andreas and Hayward                                     
              faults.  It also has implications for other                                    
              regions in the United States such as the                                       
              Seattle-Portland region where crustal                                          
              earthquakes having deep focal depths may                                       
              similarly elevate ground motions to damaging                                   
              levels at distant locations; and in the                                        
              Seattle, Los Angeles, Salt Lake City and                                       
              other regions where basin response effects                                     
              are expected to be significant.
