Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports a cultural anthropologist studying fertility,              
              mortality and wealth flows among peasant farmers in Kenya.  The                
              research will test the theory of wealth flows, that fertility                  
              changes in response to the wealth parents expect to have under                 
              varying regimes of education, employment, and family                           
              responsibilities.  This research extends a year-long prior study               
              of a neighboring community, and will provide comparative                       
              information to test the implications of the theory.                            
                                                                                             
              This study is important because population growth is one of the                
              major problems facing third-world countries such as Kenya.                     
              Unless planners can come to grips with the basic causes of                     
              declining fertility, economic development and security are                     
              precarious.  Improved understanding of the causes of variation in              
              fertility will help produce programs of fertility control, which               
              can ameliorate some of the development problems.
