Abstract    :
                   During a 1987 expedition to the Marquesas Island chain, the               
              principal investigators mapped part of a high ridge that lies at               
              the intersection of the Marquesas swell with the Marquesas fracture            
              zone.  They concluded that the fracture zone is a weak zone within             
              the Pacific plate that allowed magmas from a weak hotspot to reach             
              the surface.  This project will survey sections of the Marquesas               
              fracture zone using multibeam bathymetric tools, gravity,                      
              magnetics, single-channel reflection, and dredging.  The survey                
              will study the magmatic expression of three hotspots before,                   
              during, and after they encounter the fracture zone.  The morphology            
              of the fracture zone at the hotspot intersections will be                      
              contrasted with other segments that have not encountered hotspots.             
              The overall goals are to better constrain the origin of fracture               
              zone topography, the intrinsic dimension and temporal continuity of            
              hotspots, their interaction with lithospheric discontinuities, and             
              the azimuth and extent of the oldest section of the Marquesas                  
              fracture zone.
