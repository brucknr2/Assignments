Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a part of the coordinated research program in seismic                  
              precast concrete structures.  This project focuses on the                      
              study of connections of precast concrete structures.                           
                                                                                             
              The response of precast concrete structures to earthquake                      
              loading is governed largely by the behavior of the connectons.                 
              Before precast concrete can be widely used in seismic regions,                 
              suitable connections must be developed.  The behavior of                       
              individual connections influences the response of the total                    
              structural system, which in turn dictates the loads and                        
              ductility demands on the connection.  Establishing suitable                    
              connection characteristics thus involves an interaction                        
              between testing, analytical modeling of the connector force-                   
              displacement relationships, and dynamic analyses of the                        
              response of the complete structural system.                                    
                                                                                             
              The objective of the project is to provide a framework within                  
              which the necessary developments can take place.  Potentially                  
              suitable connections are to be identified from present                         
              practice and classified according to the nature of their                       
              primary resistance (e.g. axial force or shear).  Ways of                       
              combining or improving them by design will be investigated.                    
              Analytical models will be generated.  Based on performance                     
              predictions from seismic response analysis, suitable                           
              connections will be selected for physical testing in                           
              subsequent studies, and the parameters to be varied in the                     
              tests will be identified.
