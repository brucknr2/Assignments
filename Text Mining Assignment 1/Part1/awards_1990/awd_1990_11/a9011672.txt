Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a part of a coordinated research program in seismic                    
              precast concrete structures.  This projects will develop a                     
              limit state design methodology for precast concrete structures                 
              present design standards and past research in structural                       
              reliability theory will be drawn upon.  The methodology will                   
              be able to incorporate the energy dissipative and other                        
              innovative characteristics used in the connection design, and                  
              will be updated and expanded to incorporated the current                       
              research findings.                                                             
                                                                                             
              The design recommendations at the completion of the project                    
              will ensure maximum technology transfer of new and innovative                  
              research results.
