Abstract    :
              For environmentalists and industrialists alike, technological                  
              innovation is emerging as the principal means by which we achieve              
              environmentally sustainable economic growth.  To this end, new                 
              approaches are needed to routinely integrate environmental                     
              factors into the engineering of transportation and energy                      
              systems, manufacturing processes, and industrial products.                     
                                                                                             
              This grant supports the organization of symposium, "Toward 2000:               
              Environment, Technology and the New Century," to conceptualize                 
              and define issues and modernization.  Undertaken in collaboration              
              with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development                 
              (OECD), in the context of OECD's Society, Technology and Economy               
              Program (TEP), the symposium will bring together about 50 experts              
              in science, technology, industry, finance and government, and                  
              will include international representation.
