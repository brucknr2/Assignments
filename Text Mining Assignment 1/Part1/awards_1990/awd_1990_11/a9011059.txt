Abstract    :
              This grant provides partial support for travel for participants in             
              the "International Conference on Micromechanics of Failure of                  
              Quasi-Brittle Materials" to be held in Albuquerque, New Mexico                 
              during June 1990.  Quasi-brittle materials such as concrete, rock,             
              ceramics and ice represent important engineering materials.                    
              Research on their failure is rapidly changing our understanding of             
              these processes and will be discussed in this conference.
