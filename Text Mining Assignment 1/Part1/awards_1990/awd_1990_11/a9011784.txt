Abstract    :
                This research is to analyze data collected by the new IRIS/NSF               
              PASSCAL seismic instruments deployed in the Santa Cruz Mountains               
              within hours of the Loma Prieta earthquake.  The objective is to               
              investigate the seismic velocity structure in the epicentral                   
              region using three-dimensional seismic imaging techniques                      
              involving both P and S waves.  Earlier work has suggested that                 
              the nature of the seismic activity is controlled by the                        
              mechanical properties of the material along the fault, both in                 
              terms of the ability to store strain energy along the fault and                
              the possible existence of competent crustal blocks that force a                
              change in fault geometry.  This research is a component of the                 
              National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
