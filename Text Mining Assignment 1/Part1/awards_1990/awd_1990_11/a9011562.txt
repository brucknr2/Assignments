Abstract    :
              Continued studies of spin-polarized hydrogen and diversification               
              into related areas, e.g., a search for spin waves and a study of               
              spin diffusion in dilute 3He/4He mixtures polarized in an                      
              external magnetic field.  And a search for superconducting and                 
              magnetic transitions in heavy-electron materials in the                        
              millikelvin and sub-millikelvin temperature range.
