Abstract    :
              The purpose of this continuing award is to further investigate                 
              the relationship between research and development and economic                 
              growth.  Earlier work on R&D at the level of the firm found a                  
              high private of rate of return to R&D, especially to its                       
              privately financed and basic research components.  This earlier                
              work was undertaken by the principal investigator and others                   
              looking at data for the U.S., France, and Japan.  The research to              
              be undertaken in this project will extend the international                    
              comparative analysis to incorporate parallel data sets on                      
              industrial R&D for Israel and Norway.  A comparison of the impact              
              of R&D at the level of the firm and at the more aggregated                     
              industry level will be undertaken in an effort to measure the                  
              discrepancy between the private and social returns to R&D.  The                
              main output of the project will be a volume tentatively entitled               
              " R&D and Economic Growth".  Besides summarizing the previous                  
              work on this topic, it will review the methodology involved in                 
              estimating rates of return from R&D, survey the work of other                  
              researchers on the same and related topics, integrate the                      
              results, and evaluate policy conclusions that emerge from the                  
              analysis.
