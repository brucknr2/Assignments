Abstract    :
              Hydrogenated amorphous silicon films                                           
              will be deposited using low

              be used as a replacement for silane,                                           
              phosphene, diborane and methane.  We

              prepared under a variety of                                                    
              deposition conditions.  The                                                    
              liquid sources together with the                                               
              magnetically confined microwave                                                
              produced plasma are expected to                                                
              deposit high quality films at very                                             
              high growth rates (>10A/s).  We are                                            
              already getting interesting results                                            
              on intrinsic and carbon doped films                                            
              deposited in a linear system.  Our                                             
              ultimate goal is to improve the                                                
              quality of the films by varying                                                
              various deposition parameters (e.g.,                                           
              microwave power, magnetic field, gas                                           
              pressure, substrate temperature,                                               
              etc.)  This will finally improve                                               
              the quality of the devices made from                                           
              these films.  Another goal is to                                               
              reduce the toxic and explosive risks                                           
              associated with present film
