Abstract    :
              The objective of the proposed research is to study the effect                  
              of ambient pressure on the ignition delay time and the burning                 
              time of boron agglomerates.  In this investigation a probe-                    
              supported boron agglomerate mounted inside a high-pressure                     
              combustion chamber is ignited by a CO2 laser beam.  The use of                 
              the laser ignition technique and high-pressure combustion                      
              chamber will permit the variation of the ambient pressure and                  
              oxidant mole fraction.  Surface temperature measurements of                    
              the laser-ignited boron agglomerate during the ignition and                    
              combustion events will be carried out using a near-infrared,                   
              two-color pyrometer.  In conjunction with the two-color                        
              pyrometer, a broadband radiometer is used to record the                        
              radiation emitted by the boron agglomerate.  From the temporal                 
              outputs of the two-color pyrometer and the broadband                           
              radiometer, it is possible to determine the ignition                           
              temperature, the preignition delay time and the burning time                   
              of the boron agglomerate as function of ambient pressure and                   
              oxidant mole fraction.                                                         
                                                                                             
              Boron slurries have a significant advantage over conventional                  
              jet fuels when evaluated on an energy-density basis.  This                     
              project will provide experimental determination of boron                       
              particle agglomerate burning rates in the operating pressure                   
              range of one to 20 atm, typical of high-performance air-                       
              breathing engines.
