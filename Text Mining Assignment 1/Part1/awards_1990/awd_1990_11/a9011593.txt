Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic                  
              Program is made to Dr. Frank J. Feher of the Chemistry                         
              Department of the University of California at Irvine to support                
              work on transition-metal-containing silsesquioxanes.  In                       
              previous work, a vanadium complex of this type was found to                    
              catalyze polymerization of ethylene and propylene.  In this                    
              study, the structure of the active polymerization catalyst and                 
              the mechanism by which it operates will be investigated.  The                  
              results may be relevant to the reaction chemistry of                           
              silica-supported transition metal complexes generally.  The                    
              understanding of silica surface structure and reactivity is of                 
              practical importance for applications in catalysis, ceramics,                  
              adsorbents, abrasives, thickeners, and lubricants.                             
                                                                                             
              Large, incompletely condensed silsesquioxanes with structural                  
              similarities to silicon dioxide polymorphs have been prepared                  
              and used to prepare polyhedral oligometallasilsesquioxanes                     
              (POMSS).  Vanadium, zirconium, titanium, molybdenum, and                       
              chromium complexes will be prepared, their catalytic reactivity                
              tested, and the structure of their active sites determined.                    
              Solid state NMR will be used extensively.
