Abstract    :
              Professor Robert Wood is supported by a grant from the                         
              Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to perform                     
              experimental and theoretical studies on aqueous solutions at                   
              high temperatures and pressures.  This research is particularly                
              important in understanding a variety of industrial and natural                 
              processes such as:  mineral transport, deposition and                          
              alteration; hydrocarbon formation, migration and accumulation;                 
              electric power boiler corrosion; and hydrothermal reservoir                    
              utilization.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              Professor Wood will measure the heat capacity and density of a                 
              variety of aqueous solutions in the temperature range from 300                 
              to 450 C, and at pressures up to 40 MPa.  Both 1-1 and 2-1                     
              electrolytes will be studied.  New instrumentation will be                     
              developed to improve the speed and accuracy of these                           
              measurements under extreme conditions.  Monte Carlo and/or                     
              molecular dynamics simulations will be used to predict the                     
              properties of aqueous solutions at temperatures above the                      
              current experimental limits, and to explore hydrophobic                        
              interactions at room temperature.  The predictions of the hard                 
              sphere ion in a compressible dielectric continuum will be                      
              tested.
