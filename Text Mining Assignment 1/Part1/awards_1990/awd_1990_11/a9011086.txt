Abstract    :
              Dr. Goldberg is continuing his research toward a biography of                  
              General Leslie R. Groves, Commanding General of the Manhattan                  
              Engineer District.  No scholarly biography of Groves has yet                   
              been written.  All previous treatments of Groves show him                      
              "full blown" and unexplained in September 1942 in the office                   
              of OSRD Director Vannevar Bush.  Dr. Goldberg's study is                       
              providing a context for understanding who Leslie R. Groves                     
              was, why he was picked to head the atom bomb project and why                   
              he was so effective. In addition, this biographical study                      
              provides a vehicle for analyzing anew the changing                             
              relationship between the military and civilian sectors of the                  
              American scientific and technological research communities                     
              during and immediately after World War II.
