Abstract    :
                This research is to study the Loma Prieta earthquake using                   
              strong ground motion stations and aftershock recordings to (a)                 
              map the variability of the fault zone structure along the rupture              
              zone of the Loma Prieta earthquake to locate fault irregularities              
              controlling rupture initiation, termination, and complexities;                 
              (b) incorporate known broad regional three dimensional structure               
              in the modeling of the complete set of strong ground motion data               
              within 50 km of the epicenter to determine whether effects of                  
              known three dimensional structure can explain any of the observed              
              variations in intensity of ground motion; and (c) derive                       
              corrections to rupture models based on the assumption of plane                 
              layered structure.
