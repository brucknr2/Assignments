Abstract    :
              The purpose of this proposal is to apply a general equilibrium                 
              model designed to assess the effects of US tax policies aimed at               
              encouraging investment.  This model will be applied in an open                 
              economy context which will account for the interactions between                
              the U.S. economy and the rest of the world.  An important                      
              innovation in this research is that particular attention will be               
              paid to the international flows of financial capital and the                   
              international cross-ownership of capital stocks.  Two main types               
              of policies will be examined.  One type involves policies aimed                
              at the promotion of domestic savings.  These policies include                  
              proposals to base the individual income tax more exclusively on                
              consumption.  The second type emphasizes the promotion of                      
              domestic investment.  These policies include tax credits for                   
              investments in domestic plant and equipment, and reductions in                 
              statutory U.S. corporate income tax rates.  The various policy                 
              options will be analyzed along a number of dimensions including                
              effects on domestic and foreign welfare; on saving and investment              
              by domestic and foreign households; on the size, ownership, and                
              industrial allocation of the U.S. capital stock; and on the trade              
              balance and other components of the balance of payments.
