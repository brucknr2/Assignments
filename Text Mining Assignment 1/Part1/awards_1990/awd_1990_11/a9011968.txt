Abstract    :
              The researchers propose three projects designed to promote basic               
              plant science and ecological research at Florida State University:             
              (1) to construct and equip one 3100-sq.-ft.  Freon-air-conditioned             
              greenhouse, (2) to re-skin and refurbish one older greenhouse, and             
              (3) to purchase six new plant growth chambers.  These facilities               
              will be used for a variety of both single-and multiple-user                    
              projects.  A sample of proposed research that would use these                  
              facilities includes studies of the transfer of traits between plant            
              species by means of somatic hybridization (Bates, major user), the             
              evolution of plant competitive performance as a function of                    
              environmental conditions (Miller, major user), the role of                     
              essential polypeptides in the water-oxidizing complex of                       
              photosystem II (Homann, major user), the importance and mechanisms             
              of inter-and intracellular sucrose movement in plant leaves                    
              (Outlaw, major user), interactions among natural enemies, physical             
              factors, and plant nutrition in their effects on the population                
              dynamics of planthoppers (Strong, major user), the basis of                    
              patterns of population differentiation and divergence at different             
              spatial scale (Winn, major user),and interactions between selection            
              and gene flow in determining patterns of adaptive variation in                 
              poeciliid fishes (Travis, minor user).
