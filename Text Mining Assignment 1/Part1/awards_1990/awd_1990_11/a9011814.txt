Abstract    :
              This proposal request funds for the purchase of an x-ray                       
              diffractometer and accessory equipment.  This instrument would                 
              provide data on the structure of biological micro-molecules which              
              is essential for an understanding of relationship between structure            
              and function.  Professors Benkowic, Farber, Matthews Villafranca               
              in the Chemistry Department and Professors Johnson and Tien in the             
              Molecular and Cell Biology Department at the Pennsylvania State                
              University are involved in a variety of projects which probe                   
              different aspects of the folding, stability and activity of                    
              enzymes.  Their efforts have resulted in a large body of data on               
              the solution phase properties of these proteins which they would               
              now like to understand in terms of the three-dimensional structure.            
              In many cases, the genes for these proteins have been cloned into              
              high expression vectors and can be manipulated by protein                      
              engineering.  An X-ray Diffraction Facility would provide a means              
              of obtaining high resolution structural data on the naturally-                 
              occurring proteins and the mutants constructed to probe the                    
              structure/function/folding relationships.  The information obtained            
              would play a crucial role in advancing the knowledge of proteins               
              and greatly improve the possibility of harnessing these                        
              macromolecules to solve pressing problems in medicine, biochemistry            
              and chemistry.
