Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Description:  This project provides funding for four U.S.                      
              scientists to participate in a five day conference in New                      
              Delhi, India in the second week of January 1991.  The                          
              conference will focus on MOS Analog VLSI Circuit                               
              Engineering.  The Indian organizer is Dr. A.B.                                 
              Bhattacharyya, Chairman, Center for Applied research in                        
              Electronics at the Indian Institute of Technology, New                         
              Delhi.  Topics to be covered will include: CMOS process                        
              technology and analog circuits; MOS device modeling;                           
              sensors and transducers micropower design; conversion                          
              circuits; filters; design methods and automation; mixed                        
              mode simulation; automated physical layout; and emerging                       
              research topics.

              bringing researchers in academia with technical people                         
              engaged in research and development in industry and to                         
              address questions in design and automation.  In addition,                      
              areas where potential collaboration can result and would be                    
              beneficial will be identified.  A number of U.S. electronic                    
              companies with branches in India will be represented in the                    
              conference.
