Abstract    :
              This proposal is to complete the first phase of a longitudinal                 
              study of social and cultural change in six rural towns in                      
              Venezuela.  The towns are located in a zone slated for a large-                
              scale, multi-stage regional development program based on                       
              commercial pine plantations, sawmills and paper pulp mills, and                
              large infrastructural projects which include a new regional                    
              system of highways and a bridge linking the zone to the                        
              industrial complex at Ciudad Guayana.  The data will make it                   
              possible to explore how management of natural resources affects                
              and responds to the social and economic structures of local                    
              communities in a developing nation.  The results will be                       
              generalizable beyond the study area and the methods will be                    
              replicable.
