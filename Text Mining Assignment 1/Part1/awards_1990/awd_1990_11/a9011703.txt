Abstract    :
                   Recent evidence suggests that fecundity in women begins to                
              decline 15 or more years before the average age of menopause, but              
              the physiological mechanisms of this process are poorly                        
              understood.  Ovarian function is an important proximate                        
              determinant of fecundity, and can be assessed through salivary                 
              measurement of circulating ovarian steroids.  The research                     
              proposed will examine the relationship between age and ovarian                 
              function by determining, for three groups of regularly-cycling                 
              women, ages 35-39, 40-44, and 45-49, (1) episodic patterns of                  
              luteal progesterone release in saliva and (2) patterns and levels              
              of salivary estradiol across the menstrual cycle.  Comparisons                 
              will be made across groups and with previously-determined                      
              profiles of younger women (under 35 years of age).                             
                   This study will seek to identify specific aspects of ovarian              
              function which may be altered in women of late-reproductive age,               
              and thus which may contribute to impairment of fecundity.  The                 
              results of this research will contribute to understanding of this              
              process in our own population.  They will also help to provide                 
              additional bases for study of the age structure of fecundity in                
              other populations of anthropological interest, and for                         
              consideration of the historical development of human menopause.
