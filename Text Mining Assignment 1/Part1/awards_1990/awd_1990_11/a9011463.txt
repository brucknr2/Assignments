Abstract    :
              The primary objective of this research is to analyze the economic              
              impact of policies designed to reduce emissions of greenhouse                  
              gases.  As an illustration, a tax on fossil fuel combustion,                   
              based on the carbon content of each fuel, could be imposed in                  
              order to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.  This would induce                   
              substitution of other inputs for fossil fuels and increase the                 
              relative utilization of fuels such as natural gas with a low                   
              carbon content.  To model the economic impact of restricting the               
              emissions of greenhouse gases, U.S. economic growth is simulated               
              with and without these restrictions.  The model is characterized               
              by three distinctive features:  (1) It is highly disaggregated                 
              with separate models of production for thirty-five industrial                  
              sectors.  (2) The behavioral equations of the model are estimated              
              econometrically from an extensive new data base constructed                    
              specifically for this purpose.  (3) The dynamics of the model are              
              based on intertemporal optimization by households and firms.                   
              This project is important because it will begin to give us a                   
              better understanding of the behavior of the U.S. economy in                    
              response to policies designed to limit the emissions of                        
              greenhouse gases.
