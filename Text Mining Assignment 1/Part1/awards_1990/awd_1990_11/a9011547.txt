Abstract    :
              This project provides an empirical analysis of product liability               
              insurance focusing on three classes of issues: the functioning of              
              the rate-making process, the performance of the product                        
              liability insurance market, and the impact of state insurance                  
              regulations and states' product liability statutes on insurance                
              market performance.                                                            
                                                                                             
              Among the key matters of interest are: (1) determination of the                
              speed of the merit rating adjustment process and the relationship              
              of this updating to the insurance regulation structure; (2) the                
              role of uncertainty in loss performance in influencing insurance               
              rates, differences across regulatory regimes in the role of                    
              uncertainty, and the impact of uncertainty on price competition                
              and quantity rationing; (3) the effect of differences in                       
              regulatory and product liability regimes across states on changes              
              over time in price competition and quantity rationing during the               
              1980-84 period;  and (4) the nature of the non-linear price                    
              schedules for insurance.                                                       
                                                                                             
              Although a substantial literature exists on recent patterns in                 
              the insurance industry, with the exception of some recent work in              
              medical malpractice, the entire literature has been devoted                    
              almost exclusively to analyzing aggregative data on total                      
              premiums and total loss rations by state and by year. The current              
              project utilizes a data base consisting of approximately                       
              individual policies over a five year period. This data base will               
              enable the research to distinguish changes in insurance price and              
              insurance quantity purchased. This will greatly extend the domain              
              of concerns that can be addressed.
