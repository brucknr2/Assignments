Abstract    :
                   This is a project to evaluate the incidence and patterning                
              of mechanical and nutritional stress as a consequence of European              
              contact in Native American populations from the Great Lakes                    
              region.  Samples will be drawn from archaeologically-derived                   
              human skeletal and dental material from Michigan and western New               
              York State, representing precontact (Late Prehistoric) and                     
              postcontact (Early Historic) time periods.  Using non-invasive                 
              computerized tomography, variation in bone mineral density will                
              be assessed.  In addition, incidence of dental caries, attrition,              
              and enamel hypoplasia will be examined as measures of nutritional              
              quality.  These data will be used to determine whether changes in              
              dietary quality as a result of European contact led to                         
              nutritional and/or mechanical stress as reflected in the teeth                 
              and skeleton.
