              Description:  This project supports a collaborative project                    
              by Drs. Arun Shukla of the Mechanical Engineering                              
              Department, University of Rhode Island (URI), and B.D.                         
              Agarwal, of the Mechanical Engineering Department, Indian                      
              Institute of Technology, Kanpur (IIT-K).  The project aims                     
              at the study of damage initiation and growth, under dynamic                    
              loading conditions, in transparent birefringent composites                     
              made of glass fibers and polyester resin.  An optical                          
              recording system of the Cranz Schardin type is to be                           
              designed and constructed at IIT-K.  It will be capable of                      
              recording 20 pictures at rates from 20,000 to 900,000                          
              frames per second.  Specimens are to be photographed during                    
              the fracture process at very short time intervals.  Initial                    
              fringe patterns are expected to give information on the the                    
              damage initiation conditions while subsequent fringe                           
              patterns will give information about the dynamic damage                        
              growth and damage arrest conditions.                                           
                                                                                             
              Scope:  The topic of this research on fracture of                              
              composites under dynamic loads is timely since it is not                       
              currently well understood.  The Indian and U.S.                                
              collaborators have expertise in dealing with the subject                       
              research.  Their experiences complement each other well.                       
              This project represents a case of a potentially very useful                    
              international collaboration.
