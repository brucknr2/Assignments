Abstract    :
              Support is requested to develop an Advanced Light Microscopy                   
              Facility (ALMF).  The nine major users and two minor users are                 
              currently using epi-fluorescence microscopy to investigate a wide              
              range of basic problems in cell and molecular biology.  The video              
              analysis system will provide the ability to view cells and                     
              subcellular components using differential interference contrast                
              video-enhanced-contrast microscopy (VEC).  This will bring a new               
              perspective to studies of cell movement, cell-cell association,                
              cell-substrate association, and subcellular fractionation.  This               
              system will also provide facilities for quantitative analysis of               
              fluorescence intensity, morphometric analysis, and 3D                          
              reconstruction.  Programs for training in advanced techniques of               
              light microscopy for both users and their students are an integral             
              part of the ALMF.  The facility will provide video transmission to             
              classrooms for teaching and seminars and it will connect to campus             
              and national networks for transmission of digitized images.
