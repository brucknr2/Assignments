Abstract    :
              This project supports a joint U.S.-Japan workshop on                           
              Smart/Intelligent Materials and Systems.  The major objectives of              
              the workshop are to provide a forum for research scientists from               
              both countries to discuss and clarify the fundamentals of such                 
              materials and systems, identify approaches to develop them, and                
              indicate areas of research which are critical to advance this                  
              emerging technology.
