Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              How birds navigate during long-distance migrations remains                     
              mysterious, but there is behavioral evidence to suggest that                   
              some birds detect the earth's magnetic field.  There is                        
              controversy about whether such magnetic detection requires a                   
              magnetic material such as the mineral magnetite.  This                         
              mechanism would be an exciting new discovery if true, but                      
              because of conflicting results, a rigorous set of tests still                  
              is needed to establish its validity.  One property of magnetite                
              is that it can be re-magnetized, and this project use the novel                
              approach of applying a remagnetizing pulse to migratory birds,                 
              and then measuring their nightly behavior of preferred headings                
              in a planetarium.  The presence or lack of short-term or long-                 
              term effects from different conditions of remagnetization will                 
              be examined.  This approach creates a set of critical tests to                 
              reject or accept whether behavioral magnetic field detection                   
              depends on magnetic particles.  Results from this novel                        
              approach will have an impact on this controversial and                         
              interesting field, and this project also has a significant                     
              impact on undergraduate scientific experience.
