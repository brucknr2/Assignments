Abstract    :
              Hemocyanins are large, oligomeric proteins containing binuclear                
              copper centers were oxygen is reversibly bound.  The binuclear                 
              copper center is not unique to hemocyanins but is present in a                 
              variety of proteins that perform many important biological                     
              functions.  Hemocyanins, however, may be considered as prototypes              
              of this general class of metalloproteins.  The large size of the               
              native hemocyanins and the existence of subunit diversity have                 
              hindered researchers in their attempts to unravel the structural               
              basis for the disparity in chemical reactivity and spectral                    
              properties exhibited by the binuclear copper centers of                        
              hemocyanins of different species.  Two subunits, designated IIIA               
              and IV, of Limulus hemocyanin show differences in chemical                     
              reactivity similar to those that exist between the hemocyanins of              
              different species.  The small size and single binuclear copper                 
              center of these subunits should greatly facilitate the structural              
              interpretation of chemical, spectral, and electrochemical                      
              studies.  The two Limulus subunits and proteolytic fragments of                
              these containing intact binuclear copper centers will be studied               
              using chemical probes coupled with ESR spectroscopy, NMR                       
              spectroscopy, and electrochemical techniques in an attempt to                  
              unravel the basis of the disparity in chemical reactivity and                  
              spectral properties of the binuclear copper centers of the                     
              hemocyanins of different species.
