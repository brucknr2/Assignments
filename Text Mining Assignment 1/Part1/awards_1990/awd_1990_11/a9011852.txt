Abstract    :
                 This is a Career Advancement Award to support Dr. Gilbert's                 
              work as a guest investigator in the laboratory of Dr. Frederick                
              Fay at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center.  The goal               
              of the project is to define the respective roles of microtubules               
              and actin microfilaments in cell polarization and chemotaxis,                  
              using eosinophilic leukocytes from newts as a model system.                    
                                                                                             
              Dr. Gilbert will be combining her background and expertise in the              
              biophysics of muscle motility with the expertise of Dr. Fay's                  
              laboratory, which includes fluorescence microscopy and                         
              microinjection, to develop a new line of research which is                     
              anticipated to significantly enhance her career.
