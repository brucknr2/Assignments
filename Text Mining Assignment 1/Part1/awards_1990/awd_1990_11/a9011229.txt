Abstract    :
              This RIA proposal is to develop techniques to combine                          
              images of the heart using a variety of modalities:  MRI,                       
              PET and CT.  Combining such images is difficult because                        
              of differences in resolution, size and orientation.  The                       
              proposed technique is novel; it uses multilayer neural                         
              networks for the image processing tasks.  If successful,                       
              this project will result in improved methods of analyzing                      
              biomedical images, leading to potential improvements in                        
              medical diagnosis.
