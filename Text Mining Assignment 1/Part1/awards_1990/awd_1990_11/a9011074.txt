Abstract    :
                   This research involves the extension of regression methods                
              in statistics to deterministic but very complicated responses.                 
              The motivating application is from semiconductor process and                   
              device design.  In this application there are computer programs                
              that simulate the physics of the fabrication and the operation                 
              of semiconductor devices.  The result is that electrical                       
              properties of semiconductors can be computed as a function of the              
              process specifications in their fabrication.  A combination of                 
              long running times for the programs and a large number of                      
              variables that describe the process make it necessary to use                   
              statistical techniques to find optimal settings of the input                   
              variables.  One can run the simulators at a set of points and fit              
              the model to the computed values, for interpolation and                        
              extrapolation to other possible settings of those values.  By                  
              choosing the points in a structured manner that incorporates some              
              randomness, one can estimate the uncertainty in the model.                     
                   This project is in the area of statistics and probability                 
              and offers a number of statistical applications to the                         
              semiconductor industry.   The research is to explore an approach               
              that reflects some standard settings in computer experiments:                  
              many dimensions, comparatively few data points, and a need to fit              
              a complex function.
