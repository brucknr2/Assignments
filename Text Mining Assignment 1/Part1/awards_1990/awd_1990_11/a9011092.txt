Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal hopes to accomplish two major goals:  The                        
              first is to identify the relationship between chronic                          
              violence at the subsocietal level and variations in                            
              children's social/developmental well-being.  The second                        
              goal is to identify a subset of "invulnerable" or                              
              "resilient" children, i.e., those who experience the same                      
              difficulties as their peers, but who somehow weather the                       
              storm.  These resilient children will be investigated in a                     
              prospective way to determine what factors in their lives                       
              seem to protect them against succumbing to the maladaptive                     
              effects of violence on their development.  This study will                     
              use across-sectional design to address its specific aims.                      
              Children (4th-6th grade) from school districts with high and                   
              low incidence of homocide will be selected.  Children will                     
              complete measures of their perceptions of environmental                        
              violence and social support.  Their parents and teachers                       
              will provide ratings of their social and emotional                             
              behavior.
