Abstract    :
              This research investigates the processes through which major                   
              shifts have occurred in the curricular structure of higher                     
              education institutions.  It is based on population ecology and                 
              institutional theories of change in organizational populations.                
              The PI examines changes in the curricula of four-year                          
              institutions using cohort analysis.  She will use logistic and                 
              proportional hazards models to estimate the probability of an                  
              institution having a specified curricular structure, the                       
              likelihood of curricular change, and the impact of curricular                  
              change on institutions' survival chances.   A central theoretical              
              objective of the research is to clarify the general dynamics                   
              through which change in organizational populations occurs.  The                
              study will contribute to social theory and to educational policy.
