Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is part of the NSF/USGS                                           
              initiative within the National Earthquake                                      
              Hazard Reduction Program (NEHRP) to                                            
              investigate the effects of the Loma Prieta                                     
              earthquake of 17 October 1989.                                                 
                                                                                             
              The influence of local soft soil conditions                                    
              on earthquake motions is often very dominant.                                  
              Preliminary information suggests that this is                                  
              particularly true for the Loma Prieta                                          
              earthquake.  The ability to confidently                                        
              predict these effects is an important                                          
              component in the effective design of                                           
              structures, in determining the accuracy of                                     
              seismic code provisions, and in estimating                                     
              damage due to an earthquake.                                                   
                                                                                             
              The goals of the project are (1) to determine                                  
              the ability to predict the acceleration                                        
              levels and response spectrum shapes of soft                                    
              non-linear clay profiles using equivalent                                      
              linear methods, and (2) to assess the                                          
              adequacy of existing design codes for soft                                     
              clay sites, using the damage potential index                                   
              approach, based on the recorded and computed                                   
              response.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              The specific objectives of this program are:                                   
              (1) To acquire the available strong ground                                     
              motion records on soft clay sites so as to                                     
              determine a representative spectrum shape;                                     
              (2) Compare this spectrum with spectrum                                        
              shapes proposed by Seed and Sun (1989), the                                    
              Structural Engineers Association of                                            
              California (1988) and Borcherdt (1976); (3)                                    
              Analyze three soft clay sites for which                                        
              spectrum shapes have been predicted, using                                     
              recorded rock motions as input values; (4)                                     
              Compare ground  motions computed using the                                     
              computer program SHAKE with recorded values,                                   
              in order to assess the accuracy of this                                        
              program; (5) Analyze three additional clay                                     
              sites for which the earthquake damage was                                      
              heavy or where recorded motions are                                            
              available, in order to provide additional                                      
              verification; and (6) Calculate the damage                                     
              potential index using the measured and                                         
              computed response motions.
