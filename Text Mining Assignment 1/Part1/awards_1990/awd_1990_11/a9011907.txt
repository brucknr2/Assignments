Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Although identified clusters of mechanosensory neurons in                 
              gastropod molluscs have provided detailed information about                    
              cellular events correlated with behavioral modifications, little               
              is known about the functions or evolutionary significance of                   
              these cellular mechanisms.  In these studies, comparisons will                 
              focus on short-and long-term changes in the excitability of the                
              sensory neuron's cell body within the central nervous system and               
              changes in the sensory neuron's peripheral receptive field.                    
              These comparisons should illuminate the functions of                           
              mechanosensory plasticity in this group of animals, and may point              
              to primitive mechanisms involved in memory traces of peripheral                
              injury.
