Abstract    :
              This work aims to develop a declarative paradigm of programming,               
              based on flexible constructs that can deal efficiently with large              
              volumes of data. Commercial query languages and logic programs                 
              both extend relational algebra, which is a simple fragment of                  
              first-order logic. These languages are declarative, in that their              
              semantics can be specified non-operationally. Programs can thus                
              be viewed as high-level specifications and are easier to develop,              
              understand and maintain, and there is much promise for parallel                
              execution. Current implementation techniques that support logic                
              programming cannot handle large volumes of data, and techniques                
              for relational query languages cannot implement recursion, to                  
              name two limitations. This work explores an approach based on                  
              program transformation followed by fixpoint evaluation that                    
              combines the focussing properties of logic program oriented                    
              techniques with the efficient set-oriented processing of                       
              relational techniques.  In addition to the challenges of                       
              efficient implementation, many aspects of the declarative                      
              programming paradigm, such as the right combination of features,               
              the role of data abstraction and object identity, the semantics                
              of negation and updates, and facilities for program development                
              and debugging are also being studied, and a prototype language                 
              called Coral is being developed.
