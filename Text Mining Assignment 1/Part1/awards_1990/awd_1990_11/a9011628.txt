Abstract    :
                   The primary purpose of the proposed research is the                       
              determination of the requirement for acceleration of particles,                
              especially electrons during solar flares, which is as yet an                   
              unsolved problem.  Theoretical studies will be made of the                     
              interaction of accelerated particles with ambient plasma                       
              including interactions with particles, waves, and large scale                  
              magnetic fields.  Comparison with observed impulsive phase                     
              radiation such as X-rays, gamma rays, microwaves and type III                  
              radiation is used for constraining the models and for                          
              determination of the characteristics of the accelerated                        
              particles. Comparison will be made with both old and new                       
              observations as they become available during the next solar                    
              maximum, with the goal of obtaining more realistic models and                  
              furthering investigation of the acceleration process.  Results                 
              from this research should have direct application to other areas               
              of scientific research including solar terrestrial relations,                  
              magnetospheric physics, stellar flares, gamma ray bursts and                   
              activity in galactic nuclei.
