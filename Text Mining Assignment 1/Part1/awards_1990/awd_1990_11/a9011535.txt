Abstract    :
              Single-chip processor speeds are increaasing at a tremendous rate,             
              providing raw processing power that is rapidly approaching that of             
              mainframe computers.  Unfortunately, external memory speeds are not            
              exhibiting the same high rate of increase, and in high-performance             
              single-chip processors external memory references are becoming a               
              serious performance bottleneck.  One way to reduce the impact of               
              memory latency on performance is to incorporate architectural I/O              
              queues between the processor and external memory.  Analysis of a               
              processor that employs such I/O queues (the PIPE processor) in its             
              processor-memory interface indicates that these queues can and do              
              provide significant performance improvements.  However, the studies            
              done so far have only looked at the effectiveness of I/O queues on             
              scientific programs.  The goal of this research is to more fully               
              evaluate the overall effectiveness of I/O queues by generating a wide          
              spectrum of benchmark programs and analyzing their execution on the            
              PIPE simulator.  These new benchmark programs will be produced by              
              either creating a new optimizing compiler for the PIPE architecture            
              that is capable of taking full advantage of the I/O queues, or by              
              modifying the output of the compiler written for the ZS-1, a                   
              commercially available product that employs architectural queues               
              similar to those used by the PIPE processor.
