Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The objective of the proposed research is to develop new                       
              methods which utilize recombinant DNA technology and affinity                  
              separations to produce peptide (small proteins) effectively.                   
              Emphasis will be placed upon improving two complex parts of                    
              the purification process:  1) removal of cell debris, and 2)                   
              final purification to high purity.  The peptide, human atrial                  
              natriuretic peptide, will be expressed fused to the protein                    
              asparaginase in the bacterium e. coli.  The fusion protein                     
              will also contain a metal affinity binding site (MABS), which                  
              will be utilized in selectively removing the fusion protein                    
              from the cell debris.  Two different MABS and two different                    
              locations of each MAB on the fusion protein will be evaluated.                 
                                                                                             
              Final purification of the fusion protein will be by affinity                   
              chromatography on immobilized D-asparagine.                                    
                                                                                             
              The significance of the proposed research is that it can lead                  
              to new processes for producing peptide at significantly lower                  
              cost and on a much larger scale than at present.  The research                 
                                                                                             
              is also significant in that it can lead to a better                            
              understanding of how to design a MABS on proteins, which would                 
                                                                                             
              be useful in the purification of proteins as well as peptide.
