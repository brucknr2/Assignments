Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Potassium channels are important for encoding electrical messages              
              in the nervous system.  The goal of this research project is to                
              identify genetic mutations, alterations in the genetic code, that              
              affect potassium currents in the fruit fly Drosophila.  More than              
              forty mutations have been identified on the basis of behavioral                
              defects which enrich for mutations that disrupt the functioning                
              of ion channels.  These mutations will serve as the resource                   
              material for the project.  Membrane currents recorded from the                 
              mutants will be compared with those from normal currents for                   
              physiological properties.  Mutations that exhibit alterations in               
              one or more of the four known potassium currents in Drosophila                 
              will be characterized genetically and studied to determine the                 
              specific potassium current affected and the nature of the effect.              
              Because of strong similarities between ion channels from                       
              different species, information on Drosophila potassium channels                
              will aid in studying potassium channels in other organisms,                    
              including humans.  Analysis of potassium channels will help in                 
              the understanding of potassium channel function in several                     
              cellular processes including learning and memory, cardiac                      
              pacemaker activity, repetitive firing and mediation of                         
              therapeutic action drugs.
