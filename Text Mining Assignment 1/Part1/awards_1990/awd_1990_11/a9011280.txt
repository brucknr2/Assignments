Abstract    :
              I/O system performance has become and will remain an important                 
              research focus as processor speeds continue to improve faster than I/O         
              system speeds.  Because there presently exists no accurate way to              
              measure I/O system performance, it is hard to objectively evaluate new         
              I/O system designs.                                                            
                                                                                             
              A measure for I/O performance that simulates measured system workloads         
              is being developed.  The few studies of I/O system workloads to date           
              have failed to consider: (i) mixtures of both file system activity and         
              paging activity, (ii) CPU overhead of I/O system calls, (iii)                  
              variations of I/O activity across different application domains (e.g.          
              business vs. scientific applications), and (iv) interarrival timings           
              of I/O requests.  Detailed measurements of these factors in I/O system         
              performance, will be made and used to construct a comprehensive                
              measure of I/O system performance.  This measure can be used to                
              compare I/O system designs and to balance processor performance with           
              I/O system performance.  Preliminary measurements indicate that a good         
              balance between processor and I/O performance is currently rarely              
              achieved.  Results for these studies will make it possible to analyze          
              performance tradeoffs for new I/O system designs.
