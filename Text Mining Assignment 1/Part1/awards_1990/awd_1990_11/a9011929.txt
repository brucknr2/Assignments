Abstract    :
              Over the last two years, there has been increasing interest                    
              in the application of logic programming technology to problems in              
              biology.  A number of institutions worldwide have formed                       
              interdisciplinary research groups to explore this application.                 
              The group at Argonne National Laboratory, with participation of                
              scientists from Washington University, have begun active research              
              in applying logic programming to molecular biology.  The fifth                 
              Generation project at Japan's ICOT has also created a working                  
              group to explore such applications.  The purpose of this project               
              is to provide travel funds for an American Scientist (as a member              
              of a team) to attend a meeting in Japan for the purpose of                     
              developing joint research in this area between the two countries.
