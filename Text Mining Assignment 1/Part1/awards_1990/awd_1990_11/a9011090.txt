Abstract    :
              A joint Mass Spectrometry Facility has been created by the                     
              Department of Environmental Sciences and Engineering and Chemistry             
              at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC).  The                 
              objectives of the Facility are to support and promote chemical                 
              research and teaching in mass spectrometry at UNC.  The Facility               
              will provide the capability for identification and structural                  
              characterization of many different classes of compounds.  Specific             
              aims of some of the projects of the major users are to gain insight            
              into mechanisms responsible for the activation of polycyclic                   
              aromatics to ultimate carcinogens; to understand sterol metabolic              
              pathways in the plant parasites; to synthesize nongenetic proteins;            
              to characterize intermediates in the biosynthesis of ecodysteroids             
              in insects and to identify neuropeptides controlling insect                    
              development; to understand the role of -carboxyglutamyl (Gla)                  
              residues in blood coagulation processes; to characterize potent                
              enzyme inhibitors and to separate and identify products of                     
              chlorination and ionization of humics in water.  For these                     
              purposes, an mass spectrometer is needed that is capable of high-              
              resolution and accurate mass measurements, chemical ionization,                
              collisional activation ionization, collisional activation, gas-                
              chromatography and fast-atom-bombardment.  The most appropriate                
              instrument is a hybrid-mass spectrometer.
