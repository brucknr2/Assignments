Abstract    :
              Dr. Manfred M. Kappes is supported by a grant from the                         
              Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to study clusters of                   
              atoms in the gaseous state using molecular beam and laser                      
              techniques. These measurements will help us to understand a                    
              diversity of system behaviors ranging from solute behavior in                  
              the liquid state to insulator-conductor electrical behavior in                 
              the solid state.                                                               
                                                                                             
              Collinear molecular beam photodissociation and resonant                        
              2-photon ionization spectroscopies will be used to obtain                      
              particle size specific data on (i) neutral and positively                      
              charged clusters of main group elements, on (ii) "alkali                       
              solvation complexes" containing transition metals surrounded by                
              a shell of alkalis and on (iii) mixed metal/insulator clusters.                
              Results will include: real time measurements of cluster                        
              formation and ionization cross-sections, unimolecular                          
              dissociation rates, dissociation energies, quantitative valence                
              and structural isomer distributions and probes of isomer                       
              interconversion.
