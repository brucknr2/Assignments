Abstract    :
                This research will study the rupture characteristics of the                  
              Loma Prieta earthquake using three types of seismic waveform                   
              data: (1) very-long-period data from the GEOSCOPE and IDA                      
              worldwide networks, (2) intermediate-period teleseismic data from              
              the WWSSN and GSN networks, and (3) strong-motion data from local              
              stations.  The slip models obtained will be compared with the                  
              distribution of aftershocks and with fault models derived from                 
              geodetic data inversions.  Analysis of fault geometry relative to              
              fault rupture offers the prospect of a better understanding of                 
              earthquake faulting and strain accumulation over the seismic                   
              cycle.  This research is a component of the National Earthquake                
              Hazard Reduction Program.
