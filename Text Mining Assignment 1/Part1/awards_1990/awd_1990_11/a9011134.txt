Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project involves a comparative analysis                                   
              of damage to public property caused by the                                     
              Loma Prieta and Whittier earthquakes.                                          
              Specific objectives of the study are:                                          
                                                                                             
              (1)  to collect a detailed listing of physical                                 
                   damage to public facilities including                                     
                   public buildings, streets, bridges and                                    
                   water sewer systems and document repair                                   
                   and replacement costs for each class of                                   
                   damage;                                                                   
              (2)  to produce one way descriptive statistics                                 
                   that show the overall damage pattern and                                  
                   the damage pattern for each jurisdiction;                                 
              (3)  to compare the distribution of damage                                     
                   across types of facilities with that                                      
                   experienced in the Whittier Narrows                                       
                   earthquake and test the hypothesis that                                   
                   the proportion of damages for each class                                  
                   is the same;                                                              
              (4)  to calculate damage ratios for various                                    
                   systems based on the actual losses and                                    
                   secondary data on the amount and value of                                 
                   property in each case study jurisdiction;                                 
                   and                                                                       
              (5)  to compare the actual damage experienced                                  
                   in both Whittier Narrows and the Loma                                     
                   Prieta earthquakes to the damage                                          
                   predicted by the ATC-13 damage estimation                                 
                   method and determine the variation of                                     
                   each to the predicted values.
