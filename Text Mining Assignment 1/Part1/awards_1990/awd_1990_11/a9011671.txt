Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a part of the coordinated research program in seismic                  
              precast concrete structures.  This project will develop                        
              structural concepts for using precast concrete in seismic                      
              zones of the United States.  Due primarily to current building                 
              codes and lack of relevent analytical and experimental data,                   
              precast concrete is not currently used in U.S. seismic zones.                  
                                                                                             
              Initially, several regional research workshops will be held                    
              around the country.  These will be limited in size to                          
              facilitate interaction among the participants who will be                      
              invited to represent various contributors to the                               
              design/construction industry (including architects,                            
              developers, researchers, etc.)                                                 
                                                                                             
              Next, the economic viability as well as structural feasibility                 
              of the design concept will be investigated.  Design documents                  
              will be prepared using the concepts resulting from the                         
              workshops.  Feedback about economical ways to improve the                      
              details proposed from general contractors will be obtained.                    
              Potential use of automated processes will also be considered.                  
                                                                                             
              The analytical model development and design criterion                          
              development projects  will require a feedback from design                      
              engineers and other industry representatives.  The required                    
              informtion to academic researchers and other means will be                     
              provided throughout the duration of this project.
