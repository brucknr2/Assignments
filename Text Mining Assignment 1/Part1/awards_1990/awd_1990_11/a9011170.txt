Abstract    :
              This is a proposal to develop bioerodible polymer                              
              matrices for the growth of osteoblasts and their                               
              precursors.  A two-dimensional model system will be                            
              developed to determine cell attachment, growth, and DNA                        
              expression as a function of the physical and chemical                          
              nature of the polymeric material.  The research will                           
              provide insight into the design of three-dimensional                           
              systems that may be useful for bone grafting, prosthetic                       
              implants and coatings.
