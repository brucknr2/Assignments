Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary purpose of this project is to                                      
              determine the extent to which new information                                  
              about earthquake risks has altered the Bay                                     
              Area housing market.  We are most interested                                   
              in determining how much, if any, the value of                                  
              unreinforced residential properties has                                        
              declined as a result of:  1) the earthquake,                                   
              2) anticipated revisions to the region's                                       
              building codes and 3) public notification that                                 
              a structure is seismically unsafe (as required                                 
              in Palo Alto).                                                                 
                                                                                             
              A variation of the hedonic pricing model will                                  
              be used to measure the Bay Area's willingness                                  
              to pay for seismic safety.  Repeat sales data                                  
              obtained from the Society of Real Estate                                       
              Appraisers will be analyzed to isolate the                                     
              effects of risks and regulations on market                                     
              values.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              The results will show:  1) the effects of                                      
              soils and structural deficiencies on property                                  
              values; 2) whether the costs of improving                                      
              seismic safety can be recouped by the property                                 
              owner; 3) the likelihood that property owners                                  
              would abandon or convert rental properties                                     
              rather than comply with the revised code; and                                  
              4) the extent to which policies designed to                                    
              induce voluntary compliance, such as those in                                  
              place in Palo Alto, have produced the                                          
              appropriate market signals.
