Abstract    :
              The purpose of this application is to solicit support for the                  
              establishment of a basic core facility for Protein/Peptide                     
              Synthesis, Purification, and Characterization in the School of                 
              Chemistry and Biochemistry at the Georgia Institute of                         
              Technology.  The facility is being established to provide routine              
              access to the major pieces of basic biochemical/biological                     
              instrumentation.  The PIs are requesting an amino acid analyzer,               
              an autoclave, an ultracentrifuge, a high speed centrifuge, a cold              
              room, a densitometer, a fermenter, a FPLC, a HPLC, a                           
              protein/peptide sequencer, a peptide synthesizer, and a                        
              scintillation counter to equip this core facility.                             
                                                                                             
              The core facility for protein/peptide synthesis, purification,                 
              and characterization will be used primarily by five different                  
              research groups whose present access to modern pieces of                       
              biological and biochemical equipment is either extremely limited               
              or nonexistant.  The facility will greatly enhance our capability              
              to investigate the effects of ultraviolet radiation on eye lens                
              proteins, the molecular basis of function and regulation of T7                 
              RNA polymerase, the effect of mutations on the folding pathway of              
              ubiquitin, the design and synthesis of specific and effective                  
              protease inhibitors, and the crystal structures of pea lectin and              
              human serum transferrin.
