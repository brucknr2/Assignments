Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Significant seedling loss in forest nurseries can occur due to                 
              fungal pathogens.  Fungicides help but don`t eliminate the                     
              problem.  The U.S. Forest Service has stated a preference for                  
              biological disease control systems if they are effective.                      
              Biocontrol technology is available for fungal root pathogens but               
              has not been applied to forest nurseries.  This project will                   
              evaluate combining new technologies of fungal protoplast fusion                
              and seed coating systems with established mycorrhizal fungus                   
              inoculation techniques for an effective biocontrol system.                     
              Research will test three biocontrol fungi and two mycorrhizae on               
              five tree species for disease control relative to fungicide                    
              application.  Significant disease reductions with biological vs.               
              chemical systems is anticipated.  This will stimulate private                  
              investment for product development.  Domestic as well as foreign               
              markets could open for forest, horticultural and food crop                     
              systems using biological disease control technology.
