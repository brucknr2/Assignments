Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A conference on mechanical fatigue of advanced materials will be               
              held in January, 1991 at Santa Barbara, CA.  This is a relatively              
              new but increasingly critical field.  The focus will be on                     
              structural ceramics and ceramic matrix composites, including                   
              intermetallic matrix composites.  It is hoped by the organizers                
              that the meeting will provide a forum for exchange of ideas among              
              ceramists, metallurgists, and fatigue specialists.
