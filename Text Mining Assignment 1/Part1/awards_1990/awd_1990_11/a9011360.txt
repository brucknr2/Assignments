Abstract    :
              This research deals with the development of high speed, high precision         
              signal processing circuits using parallel analog circuitry.  The ability       
              of analog circuits to achieve high speed signal processing is well             
              known.  However, high speed has generally been achieved at the expense         
              of low precision, making high speed analog circuits impractical for many       
              important signal processing applications such as filtering and                 
              simulation. The low precision of high speed analog circuits results from       
              the inability to control the physical properties of the devices, such          
              as transistors and capacitors, that the circuits are constructed from.         
                                                                                             
              In this work, parallel circuits that achieve the required functionality        
              independent of the device physics used are researched.  These circuits         
              are designed to perform a large variety of signal processing functions         
              and are made very precise by high speed training after fabrication.            
              Many parallel analog designs using CMOS devices are made to demonstrate        
              the technique.
