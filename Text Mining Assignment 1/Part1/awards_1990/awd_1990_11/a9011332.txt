Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is part of the NSF/USGS                                           
              initiative within the National Earthquake                                      
              Hazard Reduction Program (NEHRP) to                                            
              investigate the effects of the Loma Prieta                                     
              earthquake of 17 October 1989.                                                 
                                                                                             
              Deep arrays for measurement of earthquake                                      
              response are essential to improve the current                                  
              capability to predict the motion                                               
              amplification in deep clays, and to predict                                    
              the liquefaction of sands.  The establishment                                  
              of such arrays is consistent with the                                          
              recommendation of the recent NSF-sponsored                                     
              workshop on designated test sites for                                          
              geotechnical experimentation in the United                                     
              States.                                                                        
              The objectives of this pilot study are to                                      
              gather information necessary for the                                           
              selection of sites where arrays of                                             
              instrumentation for earthquake response could                                  
              be permanently installed.  An integral part                                    
              of this study is to review all information                                     
              available from the Loma Prieta earthquake and                                  
              other previous events in the San Francisco                                     
              Bay area to assist in selecting the most                                       
              suitable candidate sites in the San Francisco                                  
              Bay area for implementation of the arrays.                                     
              Of special interest are all field                                              
              geotechnical data acquired after the Loma                                      
              Prieta earthquake which will further help the                                  
              selection process.  Necessary steps include                                    
              visiting and surveying the potential sites                                     
              and initiating the steps that are necessary                                    
              to ensure long-term availability of these                                      
              sites.                                                                         
                                                                                             
              The final goal is to recommend sites and                                       
              areas within the selected sites for the                                        
              establishment of seismic recording stations                                    
              in the San Francisco Bay area.
