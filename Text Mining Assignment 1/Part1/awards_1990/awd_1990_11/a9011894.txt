                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              The aim of the project is to collect descriptive quantitative                  
              data on the acoustic characteristics of American English vowels                
              and consonants.  The speech materials selected will be suitable                
              for studying vowel reduction and vowel-dependent consonant                     
              coarticulation.  The phonetic segments to be analyzed will come                
              from three operationally defined styles of speech providing                    
              samples that range from strongly context-dependent (reduced,                   
              coarticulated) forms to neutral and less context-dependent                     
              ("clearly" spoken) tokens.  The goal is to be able to specify how              
              the acoustic parameters change across such forms, to evaluate the              
              perceptual significance of the changes and to propose numerical                
              models describing and predicting the observed patterns of                      
              variation.  Key questions are:  Do speakers change their speech                
              when they try to "speak more clearly", that is when they adapt to              
              listener needs?  If so, what acoustic modifications do they                    
              invoke to disambiguate reduced, coarticulated and perceptually                 
              similar forms?  What is the nature of the acoustic transforms                  
              that are communicatively successful?  The project will take steps              
              towards discovering the systematic structure of intra-speaker                  
              phonetic variation and should thus produce results relevant to                 
              attempts to resolve the invariance issue (Perkell & Klatt 1986),               
              a classical topic for general theories of spoken language and one              
              of the unresolved problems still facing the design of automatic                
              systems for text-to-speech conversion and speech                               
              recognition/understanding.
