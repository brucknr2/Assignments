Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              In 1983 and 1984, Dr. Clark Dobbs excavated the Bryan                          
              archaeological site which is located in the Red Wing region of                 
              Minnesota.  The site, which is just under a thousand years in                  
              age, covers an area of more than 20 acres and includes dense                   
              clusters of features and artifacts.  An approximately 1.6 acre                 
              area yielded a total of 558 pit features, more than 166,000                    
              artifacts, and more than 129 kg. of bone and charcoal.                         
              Excavation indicated that a palisade surrounded the entire site.               
              Crucial to understanding site function is the need to control its              
              chronology.  It is necessary to determine whether the entire area              
              was occupied at a single time and, thus, sustained a large                     
              population or whether the sites results from smaller numbers of                
              individuals who were present for a longer period of time.  With                
              National Science Foundation support, Dr. Dobbs will have a series              
              of carefully selected charcoal samples radiocarbon dated.  High                
              precision counting at the University of Washington laboratory                  
              will permit materials to be dated to within ca. 20 years.                      
                                                                                             
              The broader significance of the project lies in what it will                   
              reveal about the interaction of prehistoric Native American                    
              groups.  This general time period saw the rise of large chiefdoms              
              based further South near St. Louis in the Mississippi Valley.                  
              These "Mississippian cultures" constructed large ceremonial                    
              mounds, engaged in long distance trade, and controlled the labor               
              of large groups.  It is unclear, however, just how far their                   
              influence extended and how direct it was.  The Red Wing area was               
              clearly affected by Mississippian culture, and the hunters and                 
              gatherers in southern Minnesota were rapidly transformed in a                  
              short period of time.  This project will help Dr. Dobbs to                     
              understand how this transformation took place.                                 
                                                                                             
              This research is important because it will increase our                        
              understanding of Native American prehistory.  It will also shed                
              additional insight on how complex cultures evolve.
