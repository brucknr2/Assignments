Abstract    :
              From the very beginnings of medieval thought about the year                    
              1200 until 1687, the year Isaac Newton published his                           
              monumental Principia, the Aristotelian-Ptolemaic geocentric                    
              cosmology dominated intellectual debate about the nature of                    
              our universe.  Professor Grant is examining how the                            
              Aristotelian system managed to persist for nearly half a                       
              millennium.  To understand this phenomenon is to understand                    
              the ability of received views to persist, even in the light                    
              of contradictory evidence.  Or, better, to understand the                      
              persistence of the Aristotelian system is to understand how                    
              a scientific theory can adapt to accommodate new views and to                  
              understand how extraordinarily difficult it is to overthrow                    
              entrenched views.  By undertaking this study, Professor Grant                  
              is thus shedding light on one of the most important issues in                  
              science studies:  how science changes--and why it does not                     
              change.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              Professor Grant has found that the nearly 500 year period can                  
              be divided into two parts: 1200-1500 when the Aristotelian                     
              view was overwhelmingly dominant and had no viable rivals.                     
              The second phase from 1500-1687 was one in which a number of                   
              rival cosmologies appeared ranging from the Platonic views to                  
              those of the hermetic tradition of Hermes Trismagistus.  He                    
              has found that, even if Copernicus had never written De                        
              revolutionibus, a significant debate about the earth's                         
              possible axial rotation and orbital motion would have                          
              occurred.  Yet in 1543, Copernicus did publish his                             
              revolutionary views and the remaining century and a half of                    
              Aristotelian cosmology was one of trying to accommodate the                    
              Aristotelian system to the discoveries which emerged in the                    
              16th and 17th centuries--from Brahe's new observations of the                  
              planets and stars to Galileo's telescopic discoveries.  The                    
              results of Professor Grant's study will be a massive history                   
              of Aristotelian cosmology.  This study will have major                         
              importance for studies in the history and the philosophy of                    
              science which are concerned with the central issues of                         
              scientific change.
