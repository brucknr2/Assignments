Abstract    :
                   A widely tunable and compact IR laser source emitting in the              
              9-12 um range based on very efficient phase modulation of CO 2                 
              lasers at microwave frequencies will be constructed and                        
              characterized.  This laser source consists of a line selecting CO              
              2 laser, which is stabilized to the 4.3 um emission Lamb-dip, and              
              a traveling-wave CdTe buffered BaAs microstrip electrooptic                    
              modulator.  With a 20 W microwave drive power, it can provide a                
              continuously tunable IR power output of 10 to 50 mW at                         
              frequencies 8 to 18 GHz off-set from the laser carrier frequency.              
              The performance and usefulness of this source will be evaluated                
              and demonstrated by carrying out both direct saturation                        
              absorption and hererodyne measurements.  The saturation                        
              absorption measurements can provide individual line profiles of                
              atomic and molecular transitioons with sub-Doppler resolution.                 
              This tunable laser will also be used as a local oscillator in a                
              heterodyne spectrometer which can provide a significant                        
              improvement in system sensitivity.  An ultra-high resolution and               
              extremely low noise IR heterodyne spectrometer is required for                 
              the study of interesting phenomena in the atmospheres of planets               
              occurring in low density, low temperature regions, where sub-                  
              Doppler spectral resolution are needed to resolve fully the line               
              shapes and to map spatially the source.  The information                       
              retrievable from IR heterodyne measurements can accurately                     
              determine pressure, temperature, excitation, and molecular                     
              abundances of planetary atmospheres.                                           
                                                                                             
                   The same technology will find applications in remote sensing              
              measurements of trace gases in the earth's atmosphere.//
