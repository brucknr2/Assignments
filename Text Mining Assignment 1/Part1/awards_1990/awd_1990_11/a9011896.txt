Abstract    :
                   Study of the genetics of our non-human primate relatives has              
              been hampered by the invasive nature of obtaining samples for                  
              analysis from living tissue.  Now it is possible to obtain                     
              sufficient DNA from hair which can easily be obtained non-                     
              invasively, even from the nests of wild animals in their native                
              habitat.  In this study hair will be used as the prime source of               
              DNA for determining genetic relationships in two species of                    
              chimpanzees.   Segments of selected nuclear and mitochondrial                  
              genes will be amplified enzymatically by the polymerase chain                  
              reaction (PCR) and sequenced directly or analyzed for size                     
              polymorphism.  In most individuals studied, sequences at six or                
              more loci will be compared cladistically to address questions of               
              pedigree and phylogenetic relationships, gene flow, and mating                 
              systems.  In collaboration with Dr. Oliver Ryder, the PI will                  
              study intrapopulation variation and develop formal genetic                     
              pedigrees for two well known breeding colonies: Pan pansicus at                
              the San Diego Zoo, and Pan troglodytes at the North Carolina                   
              Zoological Park.  In collaboration with Dr. Jane Goodall, the PI               
              will study genetic variation in members of the Kasakela community              
              of Pan troglodytes at Gombe National Park, Tanzania.  A 30-year                
              retrospective genetic pedigree for this community of chimpanzees               
              will be attempted.  By using the PCR method of analysis on                     
              samples of chimpanzee hair, it will be possible to obtain genetic              
              information not previously obtainable.
