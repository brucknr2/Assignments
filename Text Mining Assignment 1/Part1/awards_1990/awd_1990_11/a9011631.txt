Abstract    :
              This Research Initiation Award is for a study of knowledge based               
              sensor integration to interprete incomplete and imperfect sensory              
              information about a physical environment.  Knowledge sources may               
              included object models, known image or scene correspondences, and              
              information from multiple sensors or multiple views.  Dr. Walker               
              will use a frame based representation and reasoning framework to               
              unify the problems of model based image interpretation, camera                 
              position estimation, and multisensor fusion.  Progress along                   
              these lines may permit better scene interpretation with standard               
              vision systems and may simplify design of new sensors and                      
              systems.
