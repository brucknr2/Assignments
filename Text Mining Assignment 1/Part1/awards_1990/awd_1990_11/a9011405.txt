Abstract    :
              The theory of general equilibrium with incomplete markets (GEI)                
              studies the pricing of securities and commodities, and the                     
              interactions of perfectly competitive asset markets and commodity              
              markets in determining consumption and investment.  Since                      
              financial                                                                      
              economics is fundamentally concerned with the pricing of                       
              securities, and since macroeconomics is fundamentally concerned                
              with the real effects of monetary assets, the GEI model provides               
              a framework for a microeconomic analysis that touches a large                  
              number of different fields.  The purpose of this project is to                 
              extend the theory of GEI to incorporate money, production, and                 
              default with asymmetric information.                                           
                                                                                             
              The contributions of this project are important because many                   
              phenomena that cannot be described in the traditional                          
              Arrow-Debreu                                                                   
              model come to light in these incomplete asset markets model.                   
              These                                                                          
              include the distinction between real and financial assets, the                 
              limitations for understanding local uniqueness and efficiency of               
              representative agent and single commodity models, the importance               
              of diversification, the dependence of asset prices on covariances              
              and not variances, the "random walk" or martingale property of                 
              asset prices, the relevance or possible irrelevance of corporate               
              financial policy, the rationale for lenient bankruptcy and                     
              default                                                                        
              penalties, the ambiguity of firm objectives, and a positive role               
              for government redirection of private investment and risk taking               
              decisions.
