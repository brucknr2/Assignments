Abstract    :
                This research is to use seismic data from permanent and the new              
              NSF/IRIS PASSCAL instruments for over 5000 aftershocks associated              
              with the Loma Prieta earthquake sequence to derive high                        
              resolution (on the order of hundreds of meters) tomographic                    
              images of P- and S-wave velocity and attenuation along a 55 X 45               
              km region near the San Andreas fault.  Initially, separate                     
              inversions will be examined and correlated with known geologic                 
              and geophysical observations.  A joint inversion, incorporating                
              velocity, attenuation and gravity will be developed requiring the              
              resulting models to reflect what is known about the model through              
              independent geophysical observations.  This research is a                      
              component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
