Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will establish a national                                         
              clearinghouse for Loma Prieta earthquake                                       
              materials for collection and distribution of                                   
              all information produced by the Loma Prieta                                    
              earthquake.  The Clearinghouse will be                                         
              administered by the National Information                                       
              Service for Earthquake Engineering (NISEE)                                     
              whose objective is to disseminate information                                  
              on earthquake engineering and allied fields to                                 
              professional users and the general public.                                     
              The NISEE program at the University of                                         
              California, Berkeley, includes the EERC                                        
              Library, Earthquake engineering Abstracts and                                  
              Computer Applications.  Each unit has a role                                   
              in establishing a Clearinghouse.  Material                                     
              from the earthquake will be collected, indexed                                 
              in the NISEE database and through library                                      
              resource sharing utilities, publicized at                                      
              conferences, in publications and through a                                     
              printed catalog.                                                               
                                                                                             
              Strong motion data will be analyzed for energy                                 
              input and inelastic response spectra.  Since                                   
              buildings and other structures are often                                       
              designed to respond inelastically when                                         
              subjected to an earthquake, these data will                                    
              provide valuable feedback on the response of                                   
              buildings during the event.                                                    
                                                                                             
              This project will archive the valuable data                                    
              base of this important event and provide                                       
              central clearinghouse services to researchers                                  
              and other users worldwide.
