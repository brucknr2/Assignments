Abstract    :
              The annual advance and retreat of pack ice may be the major                    
              physical determinant of spatial and temporal changes in the                    
              structure and function of antarctic marine communities.                        
              Interannual cycles and/or trends in the annual extent of                       
              pack ice may also have significant effects on all levels of                    
              the food web, from total annual primary production to                          
              breeding success in seabirds.  Historical records indicate a                   
              six to eight year cycle in the maximum extent of pack ice in                   
              the winter.  During this decade, winters were colder in 1980                   
              and 1981, and again in 1986 and 1987.  Winter-over survival                    
              in Adelie penguins varied on the same cycle, higher in                         
              winters with heavy pack ice.  This Long Term Ecological                        
              Research (LTER) project will define ecological processes                       
              linking the extent of annual pack ice with the biological                      
              dynamics of different trophic levels within antarctic marine                   
              communities.  The general focus is on interannual                              
              variability in representative populations from the antarctic                   
              marine food web and on mechanistic linkages that control the                   
              observed variability in order to develop broader                               
              generalizations applicable to other large marine                               
              environments.  To achieve these objectives, data from                          
              several spatial and temporal scales, including remote                          
              sensing, a field approach that includes an annual                              
              monitoring program, a series of process-oriented research                      
              cruises, and a modeling effort to provide linkages on                          
              multiple spatial and temporal scales between biological and                    
              environmental components of the ecosystem will be employed.
