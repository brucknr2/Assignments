Abstract    :
              This project involves theoretical and experimental work on a                   
              problem of great importance for game theory generally and for the              
              evaluation of game-theoretic experiments.  The problem to be                   
              addressed deals with learning and models of learning.  Of                      
              particular interest is the learning which occurs when individuals              
              play the same game against different opponents.  The theoretical               
              part of the project will focus on studying those conditions under              
              which individuals do or do not converge in such games to the Nash              
              equilibrium.  The experimental portion of the project will pursue              
              a combination of two classes of designs in an attempt to evaluate              
              both the theory of strategic learning and some of the myopic                   
              learning models developed by the investigators.  The first design              
              involves repeated play of a game with incomplete information                   
              between fixed opponents, while the second involves repeated play               
              between changing opponents.  These designs will enable the                     
              investigators to study learning explicitly within a dynamic                    
              framework.
