Abstract    :
              This investigation aims at understanding the interaction between               
              atmospheric dynamics and cloud radiative forcing. The study                    
              involves: (a) Analyses of satellite observations of the radiation              
              budget, water vapor and cloud images as well as conventional                   
              observations of SST, heights and moisture fields to obtain the                 
              regional distributions of seasonal and inter-annual variations                 
              in cloud radiative forcing and the H2O greenhouse effect, (b) Use              
              of the NCAR CCM and 1-D radiative-convective models to                         
              investigate the effects of radiative heating on the model                      
              dynamics and thermodynamics.                                                   
                                                                                             
              This investigation will make valuable contributions in our                     
              understanding of the role of clouds in modulating the earth's                  
              climate system.
