Abstract    :
              We propose to fabricate and test microwave devices                             
              based upon the non-linear voltage current                                      
              characteristics of Josephson junctions.  In particular                         
              one and two-hole microwave SQUID (Supercon-                                    
              ducting Quantum Interference  Detectors) devices                               
              and planar microwave sensors utilizing the non-linear                          
              characteristics of the junction will be fabricated.  The                       
              junctions will be ion beam milled to tolerances of                             
              100A in order to take advantage of the latest                                  
              advances in etching techniques.  Only planar devices                           
              with the electrical ground in the plane of the film will                       
              be studied.  Laser deposited YBCO films will be                                
              used.                                                                          
                                                                                             
              We will derive fundamental relationships between the                           
              critical current, Ic, and resistance, R, and the                               
              fabrication parameters of the junction in order to                             
              estimate microwave properties in the junctions.  In                            
              addition to the calculation of D.C. voltage-current                            
              characteristics of a junction in the presence of a                             
              microwave field, microwave reflection (S11) and                                
              transmission (S21) coefficients will be theoretically                          
              calculated for the first time.  Measured performance                           
              of SQUID devices and microwave planar devices will                             
              be modeled in terms of the fluxoid dynamics and free                           
              energy of the junction or weak links.
