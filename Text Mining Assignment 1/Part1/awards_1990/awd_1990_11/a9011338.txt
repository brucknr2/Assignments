                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              The investigator will complete construction of a reference                     
              grammar for Emai, an undocumented Edoid language of southern                   
              Nigeria, Intended for use by a wide range of scholars in                       
              linguistics and other disciplines, the grammar will be                         
              constructed in six stages from an outline emanating from earlier               
              periods of field investigation.  The different stages of research              
              involve analysis of the existing data base, prose narrative                    
              samples and handwritten field notes, manuscript preparation on a               
              microcomputer, and additional fieldwork.  The results are                      
              intended for a single volume incorporating a lexicon and a                     
              selection of narratives.
