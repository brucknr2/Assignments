Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research project consists of a study of several types of                  
              ion-solid interactions and their application to the                            
              characterization, analysis, and processing of advanced electronic              
              and photonic materials.  Million electron volt ion implantation                
              will be utilized in the fabrication of high performance single                 
              mode solid state lasers.  Studies will be conducted to understand              
              at a fundamental level the ion-solid processes involved, and the               
              causes of ion implantation induced changes in optical and                      
              electrical properties in III-V semiconductor materials.                        
              Additionally, heavy-ion Rutherford backscattering with time-of-                
              flight detection will be further developed to solve the current                
              problem of quantitative analysis of particular III-V material                  
              combinations such as Indium in Indium Gallium Arsenide and Indium              
              Gallium Nitride.  Certain aspects of sputtering and related                    
              processes are also included as part of this research effort to                 
              provide greater understanding of materials and processing                      
              fundamentals important to the fabrication of high performance                  
              electronic and photonic devices and circuits.
