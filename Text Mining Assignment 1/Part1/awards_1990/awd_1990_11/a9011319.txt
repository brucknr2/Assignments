Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is part of the NSF/USGS                                           
              initiative within the National Earthquake                                      
              Hazard Reduction Program (NEHRP) to                                            
              investigate the effects of the Loma Prieta                                     
              earthquake of 17 October 1989.                                                 
                                                                                             
              This earthquake caused liquefaction to occur                                   
              at many sites in the San Francisco Bay area.                                   
              Liquefaction, a very damaging form of soil                                     
              failure, caused considerable damage during                                     
              both the 1906 San Francisco and the 1989 Loma                                  
              Prieta earthquakes.  Current techniques for                                    
              determining the liquefaction resistance of a                                   
              soil deposit utilize an indirect method by                                     
              correlating the soil penetration resistance                                    
              and shear wave velocity with the liquefaction                                  
              potential.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              The purpose of this research program is to                                     
              study an alternative technique which gives a                                   
              more direct measure of the potential for a                                     
              soil deposit to liquefy, namely through a                                      
              direct in-situ measurement of the change in                                    
              soil pore pressure when subjected to shear                                     
              strain.  This is achieved by using a shear                                     
              vane. This CSU (Colorado State University)                                     
              Piezovane measures instantaneous changes in                                    
              pore pressure during rapid rotation of the                                     
              vane.                                                                          
                                                                                             
              The objective of this research program is to                                   
              apply the CSU Piezovane to identify the                                        
              material susceptible to liquefaction, by                                       
              conducting a systematic research                                               
              investigation of sites in the San Francisco                                    
              Bay area that liquefied during the Loma                                        
              Prieta earthquake.  It is expected that this                                   
              information will add significantly to the                                      
              comprehensive geotechnical investigations to                                   
              gather similar data that have been performed                                   
              since the Loma Prieta earthquake.
