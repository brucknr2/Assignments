Abstract    :
                   This project analyzes the performance of discrete-time                    
              queueing systems, appearing in packet communication networks,                  
              under dependent and/or slow (or fast) packet arrival processes.                
                   Packet processes in today's networking structures are                     
              usually dependent and they may deliver packets which are at least              
              tau time units apart (slow lines) or they may deliver multiple                 
              packets almost simultaneously (fast lines).  Such processes will               
              be described by an m-state tau-idle Markov Modulated r-Bernoulli               
              model (m/tau/MM/r/B).                                                          
                   The appropriateness of the m/tau/MM/r/B modeling for complex              
              packet processes is being established and (a) statistical                      
              multiplexers and (b) token ring networks, under m/tau/MM/r/B                   
              packet arrival processes, are being studied.  The analysis                     
              approach is based on the formulation of appropriate discrete-time              
              queueing models.  The buffer occupancy process, for system (a),                
              and the cycle time process for system (b), are described.  Based               
              on these processes, packet delay results are obtained.                         
                                                                                             
                   The following is being achieved:                                          
                   -    A powerful class of models for complex packet                        
                        processes, which has the potential of leading to                     
                        analytically tractable system modeling, will be                      
                        introduced and its superiority to previously adopted                 
                        models will be established.                                          
                   -    Important systems appearing in complex networking                    
                        structures will be analyzed under certain models from                
                        the proposed class of models.                                        
                   -    Techniques for the anlysis of queueing systems under                 
                        m/tau/MM/r/B modeling will be developed.
