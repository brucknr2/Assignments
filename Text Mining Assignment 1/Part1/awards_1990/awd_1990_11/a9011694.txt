Abstract    :
              There have been two main philosophical obstacles to                            
              investigations in set theory.  One is the opinion that there                   
              is no conception of the universe of sets that can lead to the                  
              solution of outstanding problems such as the continuum problem                 
              and the existence of large cardinals.  The other is the                        
              opinion that set theory is ineradicably 'Platonistic.'                         
              Platonism in mathematics, some argue, implies that set theory                  
              could be wrong, even though, from an internal point of view,                   
              there is nothing wrong with it.  They argue that it could be                   
              wrong because it implies the existence of things that just do                  
              not exist.  Both of these opinions, and especially both                        
              together, have led to a formalistic attitude toward set theory                 
              and, in particular, have encouraged the turn from the study                    
              of set theory to the study of models of first order axiomatic                  
              set theory.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              Professor Tait has two aims in this project.  First, he wants                  
              to argue that the conception of the universe of sets such as                   
              is contained in the 1930 paper by Zermelo  and further                         
              developed in Godel's "What is Cantor's continuum problem" is                   
              a coherent conception which supports the axioms of ZF as well                  
              as providing a foundation for investigations into the                          
              questions of the Continuum Hypothesis and the existence of                     
              large cardinals.  Second, he wants to examine the                              
              philosophical confusions underlying the idea of 'Platonism'                    
              in mathematics in light of recent literature on the subject.
