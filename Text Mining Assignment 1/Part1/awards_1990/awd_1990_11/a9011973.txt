Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                  The PI identifies five persistent problems in dealing with                
              categorical data analysis, and proposes new approaches to solve                
              them.  Because much of social science data is categorical (such                
              as race, gender, party membership, employed/unemployed, and state              
              of hypothetical latent structure models) instances of the prob-                
              lems appear in all the social sciences.  Most statistics assume                
              continuous variables, though it is known that violating that                   
              assumption can lead to erroneous conclusions for categorical                   
              data.  Theoretical constructs, such as those in Markov models,                 
              which appear widely in social science theories also often use                  
              categorical 'data,' or discrete states.  Thus these problems                   
              affect everyday data analysis problems faced by most social                    
              sciences researchers.  PI proposes to attack the five problems                 
              identified, and moreover, to do so in a way which minimizes                    
              assumptions about the distributions of the data (parametric                    
              assumptions).  Success with any of the five problems promises a                
              significant improvement in data analysis and theory building for               
              the majority of practicing sociologists.
