Abstract    :
              We have recently discovered and characterized a gene encoding a new            
              plant structural protein (ptGRP1) whose predicted amino acid                   
              composition contains 67% glycine.  ptGRP1 was the fourth class of              
              structural protein to be identified in plants.  The predicted                  
              protein structure and immunochemical studies indicated that the                
              ptGRP1 protein product functions as a cell wall structural protein.            
                                                                                             
              This gene, on both the transcriptional and gene product levels, is             
              developmentally regulated and shows increased expression after                 
              wounding.  This proposal proposes to determine immunocytochemically            
              the exact cell specificity of this gene in all organs and the                  
              temporal pattern of ptGRP1 deposition in each of these cell types              
              during development.  In addition experiments to phenotypically                 
              characterized the effects of over-and under-expression of the                  
              ptGRP1 gene are proposed.  This study should provide information               
              which will help to determine the function of this gene and the                 
              contribution it makes to the development and morphology of the                 
              plant as a whole.
