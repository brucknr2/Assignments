Abstract    :
              This RESEARCH INITIATION AWARD is to support research in the                   
              micromechanics of composite materials and structures.  Specific                
              topics to be studied are residual stress induced cracking in                   
              composites and constrained ductile fracture in multilayered                    
              ceramics.  Cavitation stability studies will also be performed.
