Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the               
              National Science Foundation (NSF) have agreed that limited                     
              subsidy would be provided to guest observers on the Infrared                   
              Telescope Facility (IRTF).  NASA provides visitor support for                  
              NASA related research which occupies approximately 50 percent of               
              the observing time.  The remaining observing time is available                 
              for observational programs of general scientific interest.  The                
              NSF provides funds for visitor support for the non-NASA mission                
              related research.  The support consists of (1) payment of food                 
              and lodging costs for three members of a visiting observing team;              
              (2) the cost of transportation of sponsored visitors from Hilo to              
              the Mid-Level Facility and the summit of Mauna Kea; (3) payment                
              for half of the costs of publishing the results of the research                
              conducted on the IRTF; and (4) the cost of the cryogens used by                
              the scientists for their observations.                                         
                                                                                             
              The Infrared Telescope Facility is located at an altitude of                   
              approximately 13,500 feet near the summit of Mauna Kea on the                  
              Island of Hawaii.  Mauna Kea was selected as the site of the IRTF              
              because it is clearly one of the world's best accessible sites                 
              for infrared observations.  The IRTF is being operated as a                    
              nationally available facility for astronomical research by the                 
              University of Hawaii's Institute for Astronomy under an annually               
              renewable contract which provides for complete NASA funding for                
              all operating costs.
