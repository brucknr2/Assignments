Abstract    :
              A microscopic theory is proposed for the rheology of complex                   
              fluids containing polymers, micellar suspensions and polymeric                 
                                                                                             
              liquid crystals.  The theory incorporates the coupling of                      
              particle Brownian motion to solvent hydrodynamics, the kinetic                 
                                                                                             
              Langevin model for polymer motion, and the polymer internal                    
              friction.  The micellar system model consider the modification                 
                                                                                             
              of micellar sizes by flow.                                                     
                                                                                             
              The proposed approach for the rheology of fluids with specific                 
                                                                                             
              microstructures has application in the production and use of                   
              polymer solutions, micellar systems, liquid crystalline                        
              polymers and living biopolymers.
