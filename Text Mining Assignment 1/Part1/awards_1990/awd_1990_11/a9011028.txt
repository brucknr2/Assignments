Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Molecular genetic analyses of mutations in retinal development in              
              Drosophila have led to the discovery of many important genes                   
              controlling neural development and interactions.  The principal                
              investigator will use this paradigm to isolate genes important in              
              the development of the sensory innervation of Drosophila wing.                 
              The research will lead to genes that control aspects of                        
              development that are not operative during retinal development,                 
              e.g., guidance of axons over long distances.  A behavioral assay               
              has been developed that will quickly detect mutations in sensory               
              innvervation.  Mutant lines will be obtained primarily from a                  
              large scale P-element insertion mutagenesis carried out in the                 
              laboratory of Dr. Allan Spradling.  The insects carry a reporter               
              gene (bacterial B-galactosidase) that provides an immediate                    
              picture of the distribution of putative gene activity.  These                  
              constructs greatly facilitate the subsequent cloning of genes of               
              major interest.  A number of the wing's mechanoreceptors are                   
              characterized at the single cell level, and much is known about                
              their normal development.  Thus, the system is advantageous for                
              the kind of developmental genetic approach that has been so                    
              fruitful in the case of the Drosophila eye.
