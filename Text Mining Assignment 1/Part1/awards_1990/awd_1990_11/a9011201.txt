Abstract    :
              An experimental and numerical study of collision between two                   
              liquid drops in an immiscible viscous liquid environment is                    
              proposed.  The drop bouncing, coalescence, separation and                      
              shattering will be visualized for different Weber numbers,                     
              Reynolds numbers, drop size ratios, surrounding flow                           
              characteristics and impact parameters.  The head-on collision                  
              of two liquid drops in an immiscible viscous liquid will be                    
              numerically simulated, by improving a previously developed                     
              code.  The predictions on drop shape and drop internal flow                    
              field will be compared to experiments.                                         
                                                                                             
              The proposed study will be useful to better understand and                     
              predict atmospheric rain drop formation, liquid-liquid                         
              extraction, emulsion polymerization, dense spray systems and                   
              several processes in material production.
