Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research constitutes the first phase of a project to test theories        
              of policy making and of mass media effects on the foreign policy               
              process which predicts changes in policy officials' national security          
              paradigm due to mass media coverage.  The research tests the hypothesis        
              that media coverage of global environmental change has initiated an            
              institutional adaptive response in the form of an expansion of the             
              official paradigm of national security to include environmental                
              threats.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              In this phase of the research the investigators will conduct in-depth          
              interviews using both structured open and closed-ended questions to            
              determine the depth and conditions of the relationship between media           
              and policy makers paradigm formation, especially between environmental         
              reporting and national security paradigm formation.  Of particular             
              interest will be questions relating to which media are most effective          
              in influencing environmental and national security questions, what             
              kinds of issues and under what conditions do media impact policy maker         
              perceptions, the relationship between media impact and other factors           
              such as agency, rank, sex, issue and functional area of responsibility,        
              and appointed versus elected policy makers.  This research should              
              provide valuable insights about the use to which policy makers make of         
              media inputs on global environmental change.
