Abstract    :
              The Organic Dynamics Program will support Professor Gerald R.                  
              Stevenson's study of "An Isotopic Probe into Bonding Changes                   
              due to Electron Addition" in the Chemistry Department at                       
              Illinois State University.  Thermodynamic  isotope effects are                 
              being obtained in order to generate a new probe into the nature                
              of aromaticity.                                                                
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
              Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, electron spin                         
              resonance spectroscopy, and calorimetric techniques are being                  
              used to measure the thermodynamic parameters controlling  one                  
              and two electron transfer reactions from reduced annulene anion                
              radicals or dianions to  neutral annulenes and perdeuteriated                  
              neutral annulenes.  The resulting thermodynamic isotope effects                
              will be related to changes in the aromatic nature of annulenes                 
              upon one or two electron addition.  These data will generate a                 
              new probe into the nature of aromaticity.  The "probe" will be                 
              tried on other homoaromatic annulene systems.
