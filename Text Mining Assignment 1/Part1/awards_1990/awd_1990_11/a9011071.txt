Abstract    :
              Under a Small Grant for Exploratory Research, a pilot model of                 
              a novel non-intrusive laser velocimeter system will be built                   
              and tested.  The system tracks laser illuminated particles                     
              across an  array of very small photodiodes and times them with                 
              an electronic clock.  Multi-dimensional velocity capability is                 
              achievable with a single beam and suitable arrangements of                     
              diode arrays.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              The system is in principle much more simple than conventional                  
              LDV flow diagnostic systems.  If a workable system based on                    
              this idea can be developed, it would offer a rugged, portable,                 
              and inexpensive alternative for LDV systems.
