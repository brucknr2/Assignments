Abstract    :
              This is a proposal to use maximum likelihood estimation                        
              for the reconstruction of X-ray computed tomography                            
              images.  The work involves theoretical developments,                           
              computer simulations using phantom objects, and                                
              measurements on real X-ray data.  If successful, the new                       
              method of reconstruction will generate better images at                        
              currently used X-ray intensities, or will allow  the                           
              generation of the same quality of images at a lower dose                       
              of X-ray exposure.
