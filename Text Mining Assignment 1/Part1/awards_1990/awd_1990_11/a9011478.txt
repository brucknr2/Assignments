Abstract    :
              The objective of this research is to develop a fast hardware for multi-        
              variable fuzzy control systems using Logic Cell Arrays (LRAs), user            
              programmable gate arrays.  These Logic Cell Arrays combine the logic           
              integration benefits of custom VSLI with the advantages of using               
              standard Integrated Circuits.  In this work, the multi-variable fuzzy          
              control system is reduced to Boonlean expression that can be stored in         
              the Logic Cell Array.  Using the on-chip memory, the Logic Cell Array          
              is configured so as to store the Boonlean expressions.  Therefore, the         
              fuzzy logic inferences per second (FLIPS) of the system are determined         
              by the response time of the Logic Cell Array.                                  
                                                                                             
              In most of the current applications of fuzzy controllers, software is          
              employed as a medium for the implementation of fuzzy control rules.  The       
              hardware approach pursued in this research gives a cheaper and more            
              effective implementation.  Furthermore, it expands the actual use of           
              fuzzy controller in many application areas where speed is critical such        
              as robot control and speech recognition, among others.
