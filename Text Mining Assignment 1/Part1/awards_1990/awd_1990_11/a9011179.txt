Abstract    :
              To simultaneously handle syntactic and semantic ambiguity, we                  
              propose using the shared-packed parse forest of Seo and Simmons                
              (1989) in conjunction with the logical form representation of a                
              sentence developed by Harper (1990). If the packed parse forest                
              is used alone, informed decisions about semantic ambiguities                   
              cannot be made while addressing syntactic ambiguities.  If                     
              logical form alone is used, all syntactic ambiguities must be                  
              resolved before providing the logical form for the sentence.                   
              Logical form can be specified precisely given a parse tree, but                
              with a parser that provides one parse tree at a time, finding the              
              correct parse tree requires exponential time.                                  
              The algorithm resulting from the wedding of logical form to                    
              packed forests will produce a compact intermediate representation              
              for an ambiguous sentence in polynomial time.  As syntactic and                
              semantic ambiguity are mutually constraining, maintaining both in              
              the intermediate representation should focilitate their inter-                 
              effectiveness.  As more information is processed this                          
              intermediate representation will be incrementally updated until                
              the parse forest is reduced to a single tree containing one                    
              logical form.  In addition, the modularity of this approach will               
              reduce the conceptual complexity of the natural language problem.
