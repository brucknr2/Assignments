Abstract    :
              This project is concerned with the design of efficient parallel                
              algorithms for solving various graph problems arising from disparate           
              areas in Computer Science.  These problems can be roughly divided into         
              three categories: graph layout problems, some fundamental problems for         
              planar graphs, and optimization problems for a class of special graphs         
              including permutation graphs, comparability graphs, and cographs.              
              Because of their broad applications in a variety of applied science            
              disciplines, sequential algorithms for these problems have been                
              extensively studied.  But it appears difficult to solve them in                
              parallel.  Either no fast parallel algorithms for solving them are             
              known; or parallel algorithms exist, but require a very large number           
              of processors.  The properties of these graphs and intrinsic                   
              structures of these problems will be investigated, and new parallel            
              algorithms for solving them will be developed (or the efficiency of            
              existing parallel algorithms will be improved).  A main concern of             
              this project is to identify common characteristics and to find                 
              algorithmic tools for the problems in each category.  The results              
              produced from this study will provide not only efficient parallel              
              algorithms for individual problems, but also new understanding of              
              these special graphs and new techniques for designing parallel                 
              algorithms.
