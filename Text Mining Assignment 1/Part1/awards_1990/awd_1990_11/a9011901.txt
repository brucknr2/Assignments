Abstract    :
              This project is in the area of Analytical and Surface Chemistry                
              and in the subfield of solute extraction.  Professor Echegoyen                 
              will study the solution thermodynamics associated with the                     
              extraction of selected isotopes using naturally occurring and                  
              synthetically prepared crown ether ionophores.                                 
                                                                                             
              This research will use chemically or electrochemically prepared                
              anion radicals or dianions of anthraquinone substituted crown                  
              ether ionophores.  Extraction equilibria involving these                       
              species with selected cation isotopes from aqueous solution                    
              will be quantified using atomic absorption spectroscopy and                    
              electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy.  The results                     
              obtained in this research would have a profound affect on                      
              isotope purification processes.
