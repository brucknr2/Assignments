Abstract    :
                This research is to analyze 16 well-recorded aftershocks of the              
              October 17, 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake recorded on a variety of               
              site conditions in the East Bay area using the new NSF/IRIS                    
              PASSCAL seismic instruments.  Preliminary analysis of these data               
              shows clear amplification on mud with respect to both alluvium                 
              and rock sites.  Further analysis is necessary to quantify                     
              rigorously the details of the site response, including a                       
              quantification of uncertainties.  We will investigate ground                   
              motions on sediment sites over the entire available frequency                  
              band, roughly 1 to 40 Hz.  Converted S-to-P phases may be useful               
              for constraining the depth of the sediment layers, a quantity                  
              that is constrained in some places by geotechnical data but which              
              is known to vary considerably over scales of 100 meters.  This                 
              research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard                      
              Reduction Program.
