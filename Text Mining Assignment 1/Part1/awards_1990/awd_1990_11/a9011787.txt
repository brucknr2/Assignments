Abstract    :
              An integrated approach towards the synthesis of high-bandwidth, low-           
              latency interconnection networks is pursued that focuses on the                
              interdependence of system architecture, VLSI characteristics and               
              packaging technology.  New designs of one-sided crosspoint switching           
              modules that can provide several paths between communicating ports in          
              multichip switches are being studied.  An architecture solution is posed       
              for the simultaneous switching noise problem and that has been                 
              traditionally tackled at the circuit design and packing levels.  Novel         
              schemes for fast arbitration and scheduling through the use of parallel        
              bus-controllers are analyzed under a variety of message traffic                
              conditions.  An alternative approach uses artificial neural networks for       
              contention resolution.  Trade-offs between switch cost, performance and        
              reliability are studies under these workloads for various chip sizes.          
              Topological testing techniques are used for drastic reduction of test          
              time.  The research findings are being incorporated into a set of              
              software tools recently developed at UT Austin for the computer-aided          
              design of networks.                                                            
                                                                                             
              Recent technological advances have prompted a resurgence of interest in        
              cross bar-based designs in the industry, despite the requirement of O          
              (N2) switches.  Indeed, by considering current VLSI and packaging              
              technology, it can be shown that power dissipation, current driving            
              abilities and pinout limitations easily outweigh circuit density demands       
              of switching networks.  This research aims to lay the foundations for          
              the cost-effective design of 128-1024 port crossbars with a sustained          
              bandwidth of 1 GBytes per channel, that can form the core of the next          
              generation of massively parallel machines and switching networks.
