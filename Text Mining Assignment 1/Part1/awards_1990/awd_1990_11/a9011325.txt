Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is part of the NSF/USGS                                           
              initiative within the National Earthquake                                      
              Hazard Reduction Program (NEHRP) to                                            
              investigate the effects of the Loma Prieta                                     
              earthquake of 17 October 1989.                                                 
                                                                                             
              The objective of this project is to document                                   
              the damage to lifelines, such as pipeline                                      
              leaks and breaks, that occurred during this                                    
              earthquake, and to develop a permanent record                                  
              of this damage for use by researchers.  This                                   
              data base of pipeline damage is of value to                                    
              the geotechnical engineering community and to                                  
              researchers in seismic risk and lifeline                                       
              engineering.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              This project is part of the activities, in                                     
              relation to the Loma Prieta earthquake, of

              The ability of pipelines to remain functional                                  
              is necessary for the effective operation of                                    
              the emergence response and recovery                                            
              activities of a community following an                                         
              earthquake.  It also avoids the hazardous                                      
              pollution resulting from sewer line breaks,                                    
              and the severe economic losses and disruption                                  
              to business and industry.
