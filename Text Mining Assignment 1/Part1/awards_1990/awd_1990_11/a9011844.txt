Abstract    :
              This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the con-                 
              tinuing research of Professor Ronald C. D. Breslow at Columbia                 
              University. An important goal of this work is to prepare stable                
              organic materials that are ferromagnetic at room temperature.                  
              Success in this project could lead to the preparation of new                   
              materials with considerable practical potential in areas such                  
              as information storage and also could lead to increased                        
              understanding of the magnetic properties of molecules and of                   
              materials.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              As part of this project, new triplet species to be synthesized                 
              and studied include stabilized derivatives of benzene dication,                
              benzene dianion, cyclopentadienyl cation, and cyclopropenyl                    
              anion. The proposed physical studies include electron spin                     
              resonance spectroscopy as a function of temperature, magnetic                  
              susceptibility, and infrared spectroscopy. In addition to their                
              potential practical importance as a new class of magnetic                      
              materials, the organic triplet species provide an experimental                 
              basis for evaluating the structural requirements for a triplet                 
              ground state and for ferromagnetic interactions.
