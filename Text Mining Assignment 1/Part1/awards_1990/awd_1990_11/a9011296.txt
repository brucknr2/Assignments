Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a post-event investigation project to learn                            
              engineering lessons from the Loma Prieta earthquake (October                   
              1989).                                                                         
                                                                                             
              The objective of this project is to analyze and evaluate the                   
              effects of the Loma Prieta earthquake of 17 October 1989 on                    
              the electric power transmission systems in the earthquake-                     
              affected areas.  The studies are intended to develop                           
              additional information for defining seismic fragility                          
              functions of major transmission equipment, which are necessary                 
              and essential for a comprehensive reliability analysis of                      
              electric power supply systems for metropolitan areas.  The                     
              study will also evaluate the perfomance of the main                            
              transmission systems, in terms of the probability of power                     
              disruption at specified service areas caused by the                            
              earthquake.  The results of the study program will be prepared                 
              to constitute part of a comprehensive report on the Loma                       
              Prieta earthquake.                                                             
                                                                                             
              The project will contribute to the definition of the seismic                   
              fragility functions of electric transmission equipment and                     
              devices and to the development of theoretical models for such                  
              systems.
