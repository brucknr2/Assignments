Abstract    :
              This investigation will focus on the nonlinear constitutive                    
              relations needed for flexible composites undergoing large                      
              deformations. The theoretical phase will examine biaxial behavior              
              of a fabric reinforced flexible composite while the experimental               
              part will involve characterization of the component materials,                 
              fabrication and testing of such composites.
