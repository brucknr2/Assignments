Abstract    :
                  This research will develop representations and algorithms for              
              generating assembly sequences of products.  The problem is                     
              theoretically of combinatorial complexity.                                     
                   A method has been developed to describe axially symmatic                  
              developed to describe assemblies based upon high-level engineering             
              features and mating conditions. A rule-based algorithm derives a               
              graph-structure corresponding to an exploded-view of the assembly.             
              Interpreting this information as precedences among components,                 
              another program generates selected assembly sequences.                         
                   This research will extend the methodology to general, three-              
              dimensional cases.  The importance of this research is twofold;                
              automatically providing the designer with information regarding the            
              assembly process can significantly enhance the simultaneous                    
              engineering process; and by showing that computerized spatial                  
              reasoning is possible with high-level input descriptions,                      
              powerful design assistants can be developed for                                
              computer aided design systems.
