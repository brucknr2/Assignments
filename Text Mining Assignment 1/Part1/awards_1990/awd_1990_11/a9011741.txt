Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The South Atlantic appears to be the locus of a broad boundary                 
              between two major geochemical provinces of the earth's mantle.  The            
              DUPAL anomaly centered over the South Atlantic may be the result of            
              contamination of the asthenosphere either by delamination of sub-              
              continental lithosphere during the breakup and scatter of                      
              Gondwanaland or from the dispersal of mantle plumes of deeper                  
              origin within the earth.  A 38-day cruise to dredge the Mid-                   
              Atlantic Ridge and adjacent seamounts from about 41S to 52S will be            
              conducted.  The post-cruise analytical program will provide a means            
              to study the isotopic and geochemical nature of the DUPAL boundary,            
              delineate the possible effects of the Gough, Discovery, and Shona              
              off-ridge hotspots on mid-ocean ridge volcanism and its budget, and            
              further evaluate the merit of two competing hypotheses: the plume              
              dispersion model and the delamination of the sub-Gondwana                      
              continental lithosphere.
