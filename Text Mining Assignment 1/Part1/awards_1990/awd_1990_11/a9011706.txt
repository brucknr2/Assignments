                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              The current debate as to the status of Black English Vernacular                
              (BEV) vis-a-vis white non-standard varieties of American English               
              (is BEV converging with them or diverging from them?) requires                 
              for its resolution a richer and more fully nuanced understanding               
              of the history of BEV.  Liberian Settler English (LSE), the                    
              speech of those whose African-American ancestors immigrated to                 
              Liberia in the nineteenth century, lives as a vibrant source of                
              information about BEV's earlier stages.  Within Liberia, the                   
              Settler communities with the strongest tie to the American Deep                
              South are those in Sinoe County, Mississippi-in African having                 
              been founded there by Settlers from Natchez in 1838.  Further,                 
              throughout their history of the Sinoe Settlers have resisted                   
              integration with non-Settlers.  Thus, both the American roots and              
              the post-immigration history of the Sinoe Settlers make their                  
              speech the optimal choice for the study of LSE as an African-                  
              American linguistic enclave.  The present study draws on data                  
              from sociolinguistic interviews from Sinoe as the basis for                    
              grammatical analysis.  It also seeks to determine with as much                 
              detail as is possible the particulars of the American past of                  
              Sinoe's original Settlers and their LSE and, ultimately, to                    
              relate that speech variety to BEV, both past and present.
