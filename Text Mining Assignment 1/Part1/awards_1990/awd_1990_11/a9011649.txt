Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The proposed project will be held on February 25-28, 1990 at the               
              Banbury Center to review the present state and future prospects for            
              Mapping the Genomes of Domestic Animals and for determining                    
              linkages to traits of importance in livestock production.  The                 
              meeting will consider three major topics: 1) to determine the state            
              of the art for analyzing large genomes, with reference to the                  
              techniques and strategies being pursued in other organisms; 2) to              
              identify possible associations with gene mapping programs in other             
              species and countries, as well as the various human genome projects            
              in the U.S.A. and abroad; and 3) to assess the national resources              
              and needs in the area and to lay the foundations for a                         
              collaborative national program for Mapping the Genome of Domestic              
              Animals.
