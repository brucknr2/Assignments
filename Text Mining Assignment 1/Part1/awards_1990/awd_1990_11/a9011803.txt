Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Research in theoretical condensed matter physics will be                       
              undertaken to obtain a fundamental understanding of fractionally               
              charged quasi-particles, including how to theoretically                        
              characterize them and how to observe them experimentally.  Other               
              studies of novel collective behavior will be conducted on the                  
              finite temperature spin-liquid state of simple models of                       
              frustrated antiferromagnets, the nature of the superconducting                 
              state in the quantum hard-core dimer model, and the transition                 
              from a spinless conductor (soliton metal) to normal metal as has               
              been observed in conducting polymers.
