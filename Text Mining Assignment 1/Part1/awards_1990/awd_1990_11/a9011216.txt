Abstract    :
              Traditional DBMSs are passive: they execute queries or                         
              transactions only when explicitly requested to do so by a user                 
              or an application program. Many non-traditional applications,                  
              such as CIM, process control, hospital monitoring systems, air                 
              traffic control, and office workflow control, which require                    
              timely response to (critical) situations are not well served by                
              these passive DBMSs.  For these applications, it is important to               
              monitor conditions defined on the states of the database, and                  
              then, when these conditions occur, invoke specified actions.                   
                                                                                             
              This project advances previous work on active databases by the PI              
              by i) consolidating earlier research on active databases and ii)               
              extending the active database paradigm to efficiently support                  
              non-traditional applications requiring distributed workstation                 
              configuration. This extension helps in intelligently staging the               
              data between the database and one or more workstations and also                
              provides a mechanism for update propagation. Distributed                       
              condition monitoring is investigated to achieve the above.                     
                                                                                             
              The results of this research will relieve the application                      
              programmer at the workstation from the management of shared data               
              between the workstation and the database as well as maintaining                
              the consistency of shared data. This research is aimed at                      
              providing 'staging transparency' at the user level using active                
              database as an underlying abstraction.
