Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will study three problems in                   
              random processes motivated by ideas from dynamical systems.  In                
              analogy with Hamiltonian systems, he will develop unified                      
              treatment of symmetry and diffusion.  Borrowing from topological               
              dynamics, he will develop the use of relative entropy for the                  
              study of stochastic processes - particularly those involving                   
              models for ion channels.  Finally, from considerations in the                  
              dynamical theory of Brownian motion, he will develop a limit                   
              theorem to a stochastic partial differential equation modeling                 
              the motion of a white blood cell.                                              
                   The investigator will study three problems in random                      
              processes motivated by ideas from dynamical systems.  His                      
              approach will use techniques from the fields of stochastic                     
              processes and geometric algebra.  The models that he is                        
              considering are motivated by biological considerations, e.g. the               
              motion of white blood cells.
