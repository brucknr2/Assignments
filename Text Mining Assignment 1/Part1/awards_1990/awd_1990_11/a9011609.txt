Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This 18 kW rotating-anode x-ray generator and diffractometer will              
              provide state-of-the-art capabilities complementing a unique                   
              variety of existing neutron, electron, and gamma-ray diffraction               
              programs on the campus.  The x-ray source is configured for two                
              user beams, one for small-angle scattering experiments and the                 
              other primarily for single-crystal experiments.  The single-                   
              crystal diffractometer is a standard four-circle model built by                
              Huber and is to be equipped with a monochromator.  Proposed                    
              research includes studies of the structure and phase transitions               
              of metal surfaces and films physisorbed on single-crystal                      
              substrates.  Surface and low-dimensional physics are primary                   
              areas of interest.  Research in structural studies of metals and               
              magnetic systems, phase transitions in metals, liquid scattering               
              studies, and structural chemistry and biology can also be                      
              accommodated.  The facility provides in-house capability for                   
              experiments, graduate student training, and preliminary work for               
              subsequent studies at the National Synchrotron Light Source at                 
              Brookhaven National Laboratory.
