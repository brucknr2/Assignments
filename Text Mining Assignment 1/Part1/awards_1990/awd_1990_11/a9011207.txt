Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The separation of gas mixtures is a problem of great                           
              industrial significance.  Recent advances in polymeric                         
              technology have led to an increasingly greater use of                          
              membranes for these separations.  Different polymeric                          
              materials are commonly evaluated for a given separation by                     
                                                                                             
              measuring gas sorption isotherms and diffusion coefficients.                   
                                                                                             
              Frequently, the sorption data obtained is interpreted using                    
                                                                                             
              the dual mode model.  While this model has proved useful in                    
                                                                                             
              practice, it is largely empirical in nature and does not                       
              directly relate sorption properties to other material                          
              properties.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              This project is an investigation of the sorption of gases in                   
                                                                                             
              glassy polymers from a thermodynamic point of view.  A                         
              theoretical framework for the thermodynamics of gas sorption                   
                                                                                             
              in glassy polymers will be established.  Heats of sorption                     
              will be measured experimentally and used to validate the                       
              theoretical results.  Preliminary results suggest a                            
              relationship between sorption, mechanical properties, and the                  
                                                                                             
              heat of mixing which might aid in the screening of materials                   
                                                                                             
              for gas separation.  A comparison of the results to the dual                   
                                                                                             
              mode model allows an interpretation of certain dual mode                       
              parameters in terms of mechanical and thermodynamic                            
              properties.
