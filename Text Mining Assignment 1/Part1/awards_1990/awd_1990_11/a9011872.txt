Abstract    :
              It has been claimed by some philosophers of science that                       
              scientists give greater weight (or should give greater weight)                 
              to theories that make successful predictions of previously                     
              unknown facts, than to theories that only explain or deduce                    
              facts already known.  Professor Brush is examining several                     
              historical case studies in order to find out whether                           
              scientists actually follow this rule, and more generally how                   
              the success or failure of predictions affects the reception                    
              of theories.  Some possible case studies include Einstein's                    
              prediction of the gravitational bending of light;  Alfven's                    
              predictions about the behavior of plasmas and electric and                     
              magnetic fields in the magnetosphere and interplanetary space,                 
              the prediction of the positron from Dirac's relativistic                       
              quantum mechanics, electromagnetic waves from Maxwell's                        
              theory, the prediction of the omega-minus particle from Gell-                  
              Mann's "eight-fold way" symmetry theory, Clairaut's prediction                 
              of the date when Halley's comet would return, and Mendeleev's                  
              prediction of new chemical elements to fill the gaps in his                    
              periodic table.  The results of this research should help to                   
              clarify the reasons why scientists accept or reject theories.
