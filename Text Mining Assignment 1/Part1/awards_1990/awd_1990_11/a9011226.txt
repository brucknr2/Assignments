Abstract    :
                   Much of what is known about the dynamics of active volcanos               
              has been learned at Kilauea volcano.  Deformation and seismicity               
              data demonstrate that magmatic activity and slip on Kilauea's fault            
              systems are coupled, yet the subsurface geometry of these faults               
              and the deep structure of Kilauea's rift zones are poorly                      
              understood.  The PI will analyze surface deformation data,                     
              including new GPS measurements, to elucidate the geometry of active            
              rift and fault structures on Kilauea.  Analysis of these unique                
              data sets has the potential to answer fundamental questions                    
              concerning the dynamics of shield volcanos, and lead to an improved            
              understanding of volcanic and earthquake hazards on Hawaii and                 
              elsewhere.
