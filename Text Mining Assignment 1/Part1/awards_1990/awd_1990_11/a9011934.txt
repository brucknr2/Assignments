Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will conduct an aeromagnetic investigation along                  
              the Central Indian Ridge to clarify the kinematics and tectonic                
              implications of the zone of distributed deformation in the                     
              equatorial Indian Ocean lithosphere.  The new data set will                    
              comprise about 100 magnetic profiles spaced 15 to 25 km apart                  
              covering an area of about 900,000 km2.  This new data will                     
              permit the determination of the intersection of the India-                     
              Australia boundary with the Central Indian Ridge and will show                 
              whether the boundary is spatially sharp of diffuse.  The data                  
              will also improve estimates of the motion between India and                    
              Australia and will revel the evolution over the last 20 million                
              years of the zone of deforming lithosphere between India and                   
              Australia.
