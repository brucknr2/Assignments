Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a post-event investigation project to learn                            
              engineering lessons from the Loma Prieta earthquake (October                   
              1989).                                                                         
                                                                                             
              The Loma Prieta earthquake induced munerous incidents of                       
              damage to both ground-based and elevated tanks, and even to                    
              some of the retrofitted tanks.  In particular, site                            
              amplification of long period ground motion components appears                  
              to be the cause of large amplitude sloshing and associated                     
              damage to tanks built on Bay Mud.  In this project the data                    
              collected will be analyzed to evaluate the performance of tank                 
              structures.  The tasks include:  (1) collection of data and                    
              documentation of the damage sustained by ground-based water                    
              and petroleum storage tanks and by elevated water storage                      
              tanks, (2) calculation of the dynamic response of                              
              representative tanks and correlation of the computed response                  
              with observed damage or lack of damage, (3) study of the                       
              effects of site amplification of long period components on the                 
              sloshing phenomenon and on rocking motion of tanks founded on                  
              Bay Mud, (4) study of the damage to retrofitted tanks to                       
              deduce the reasons for the ineffectiveness of the implemented                  
              retrofit mechanisms, and (5) comparison of induced seismic                     
              forces with those specified by available codes and standards                   
              such as API 650, AWWA 100 and UBC.                                             
                                                                                             
              By comparison of the predicted response with actual behavior                   
              under earthquake loading, the analytical methods developed for                 
              response calculation of tanks will be refined and improved                     
              design procedures will be developed.
