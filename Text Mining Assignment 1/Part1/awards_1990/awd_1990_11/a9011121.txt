Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is part of the NSF/USGS                                           
              initiative within the National Earthquake                                      
              Hazard Reduction Program (NEHRP) to                                            
              investigate the effects of the Loma Prieta                                     
              earthquake of 17 October 1989.                                                 
                                                                                             
              This research program involves collaborative                                   
              funding between the National Science                                           
              Foundation and the U.S. Geological Survey.                                     
              It utilizes a truck-mounted 20 ton electronic                                  
              cone penetration system (for penetration                                       
              measurements in soil), as well as a unique                                     
              laboratory testing system which  facilitates                                   
              measurement of primary (P) and secondary (S)                                   
              seismic waves in soils.  Together, they                                        
              permit the accurate determination of in-situ                                   
              stresses in the soil.  The soil measurements                                   
              include the cone penetration test (CPT),                                       
              seismic-CPT, the Marchetti Flat Dilatometer                                    
              (DMT) and the bender element oedometer (BEO).                                  
                                                                                             
              The objectives of this research are: (1) to                                    
              supplement the existing data base of cone tip                                  
              resistance, shear wave velocity, and                                           
              dilatometer indices versus liquefaction                                        
              potential, (2) to investigate the effects of                                   
              lateral earth pressures on the liquefaction                                    
              potential, and (3) to study the effects of                                     
              soil disturbance and time (aging) on soil                                      
              stiffness and strength.
