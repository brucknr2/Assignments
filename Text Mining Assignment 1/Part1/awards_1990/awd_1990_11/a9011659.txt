Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The semiarid Great Plains of North America is an extensive area,               
              and has particular importance for natural resource production.                 
              The Central Plains Experimental Range (CPER) has an excellent                  
              location in the central Great Plains to represent the important                
              long-term ecological issues of consequence for much of the                     
              region.  The organizing concept for this long-term study of the                
              shortgrass steppe is that the major controls over ecosystem                    
              structure and function are climate, geomorphology, and landuse                 
              management.  Each of these controls has important spatial and                  
              temporal heterogeneity across a range of scales, and exerts its                
              influence at a particular combination of levels.  It is                        
              hypothesized and that the most important controls at the site                  
              level of the CPER are soil texture and landuse.  Soil texture is               
              a major influence over soil water availability, and thus                       
              vegetation structure, net primary production, and decomposition.               
              Landuse sets the equilibrium state of ecosystems by controlling                
              potential production and soil organic matter reserves.  This                   
              project continue current work and initiate new studies to further              
              examine the influence of soil texture and landuse over shortgrass              
              ecosystem structure and function using field experimental                      
              research, simulation, and regional analysis.
