Abstract    :
              It is proposed that an Optronics C-4100SP microdensitometer, and               
              a Silicon Graphics Iris 4D/280SX computer be purchased, for use in             
              structural studies of proteins and nucleic acids by Drs. Stubbs,               
              Anders, Flicker, Robinson, Newcomer and others.                                
              Drs. Flicker and Robinson plan to utilize cryo-electron microscopy             
              in their structural studies of protein assemblies: Dr. Flicker is              
              studying actomyosin complexes; Dr. Robinson studies neurotoxins.               
              Dr. Stubbs' studies of plant virus structure will also benefit from            
              cryo-electron microscopy facilities.                                           
                                                                                             
              Drs. Anderson, Newcomer, and Stubbs are using protein                          
              crystallographic methods to study a variety of molecules.  With a              
              number of new crystals new available, the present facilities have              
              reached saturation.  Furthermore, several of the crystal forms have            
              unit cells too large to permit data collection using existing                  
              facilities.  Dr. Stubbs' fiber diffraction studies also require                
              equipment capable of resolving diffraction data from very large                
              unit cells.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              The major users make heavy use of the existing computer facilities.            
              Structural refinement, especially by Dr. Anderson and Stubbs and               
              new projects of Dr. Newcomer and Flicker, will require                         
              substantially increased computing capacity.
