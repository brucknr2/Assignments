Abstract    :
                   New developments in solar flare physics emphasize the need                
              to study solar flares with high speed resolution, at sampling                  
              intervals below one second.  This is an observational effort                   
              designed to view flares in the visible spectrum (H alpha) with                 
              newly developed instrumentation combining standard video                       
              technology with an accurate clock/video time inserter. The flares              
              will be analyzed with a temporal resolution of 1/30th second, to               
              better understand the flare energy release mechanism(s).  The                  
              system will be installed on a small telescope and will be run by               
              undergraduate students with faculty direction in  coordination                 
              with measurements at other wavelengths. Participation  in MAX'91               
              and other campaigns is planned as part of this research effort.
