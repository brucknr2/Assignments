Abstract    :
              The principal investigators, David Hoffman and Joel Spruck, will               
              conduct research in differential geometry, calculus of variations              
              and applied Mathematics.  This research has a strong                           
              computational component, while still addressing problems of                    
              current theoretical interest.  The computational side two                      
              aspects: Implementation of algorithms to solve problems in                     
              partial differential equations (arising from physical problems)                
              and scientific graphics.  This research involves collaboration                 
              with many technical people and scientists from other disciplines,              
              as well as a large number of students and visitors and an active               
              research and training seminar.  Critical to these projects has                 
              been the creation of a computational laboratory, which has become              
              the core of the Geometry Analysis Numerics and Graphics Center                 
              (GANG).  Under the technical direction of David Oliver with                    
              collaboration of James T. Hoffman, senior graphics programmer,                 
              the laboratory is not only supporting high level scientific                    
              research, but also producing graphics tools for other sites and                
              providing vital technical assistance to mathematicians and                     
              scientists with the need for aid scientific visualization.                     
              Among the active research projects are: construction of periodic               
              minimal surfaces; investigation of block copolymer interfaces                  
              influenced by boundary constraints; computational fluid dynamics;              
              computational algorithms for plasma confinement; and theoretical               
              and numerical investigation of motion by mean curvature.
