Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is part of the NSF/USGS                                           
              initiative within the National Earthquake                                      
              Hazard Reduction Program (NEHRP) to                                            
              investigate the effects of the Loma Prieta                                     
              earthquake of 17 October 1989.                                                 
                                                                                             
              Over 100 earth dams were located within a                                      
              distance of approximately 100 km from the                                      
              source of this earthquake.  The aim of this                                    
              project is to evaluate in detail two earth                                     
              dams that were significantly instrumented and                                  
              in which the instruments were triggered                                        
              during the earthquake.  In addition, and to                                    
              the extent available, the recordings from                                      
              other dams, together with other information                                    
              about these dams, are also being collected                                     
              and will be made available in a single                                         
              document that can be utilized by other users.                                  
                                                                                             
              The two dams are the San Justo Dam, 150 ft                                     
              high, and the San Luis Dam, which is 300 ft                                    
              high.  These dams are respectively about 40                                    
              km and 80 km from the zone of energy release.                                  
              Soil and geologic data are available for both                                  
              dams.  Detailed one- and two-dimensional                                       
              analyses are being conducted in order to                                       
              assess the dynamic shear-strain                                                
              characteristics of the material comprising                                     
              each dam-foundation system and to examine the                                  
              adequacy of various available analytical                                       
              procedures for calculating the response of                                     
              earth dams during earthquakes.                                                 
                                                                                             
              This is the first time that such detailed                                      
              analyses can be conducted with measured                                        
              earthquake response records at several                                         
              locations of an earth dam.
