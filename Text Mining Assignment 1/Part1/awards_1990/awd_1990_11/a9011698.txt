Abstract    :
              This is a Small Grant for Exploratory Research to examine the                  
              possibility that Group I introns exist in cyanobacteria.  These                
              introns have not been found to date in bacteria, although they                 
              have been demonstrated to exist in bacterial viruses.  If                      
              preliminary evidence is confirmed and they are found, a survey of              
              Group I introns will be done within distinct cyanobacterial                    
              groups.  This research will provide data on the evolutionary                   
              relationships between cyanobacteria and chloroplasts of higher                 
              plants.
