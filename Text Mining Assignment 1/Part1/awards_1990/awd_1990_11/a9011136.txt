Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a post-event investigation project to learn                            
              engineering lessons from the Loma Prieta earthquake (October                   
              1989).                                                                         
                                                                                             
              Response data from this earthquake, together with recorded                     
              motions from other earthquakes, provides an excellent basis                    
              for evaluating seismic design procedures in the Uniform                        
              Building Code (UBC).  With this objective in mind, this                        
              project considers several buildings (one in Watsonville and                    
              three in San Jose) where such strong motion records are                        
              available.  A system identification method (named MODE-ID)                     
              will be applied to estimate normal modes of vibration.  For                    
              each building, the optimal estimates of the model forces,                      
              overturning moments, interstory drifts, and lateral forces and                 
              torsional moments at each floor level throughout the building                  
              will be made.  The variation of these quantities, together                     
              with the modal periods and damping ratios, over the range of                   
              excitation levels will be assessed.  These results will be                     
              correlated with:  (1) the building's type of lateral force                     
              resisting system; (2) the vertical irregularities in the                       
              building; and (3) the building's observed seismic performance                  
              during each earthquake. This information will be used to                       
              assess procedures and design parameters in the current (1988)                  
              UBC and the version of the UBC that was used in the building's                 
              original design.                                                               
                                                                                             
              This effort will provide a critical assessment of the validity                 
              of the existing UBC seismic design provisions based on the                     
              real-world field performance data.
