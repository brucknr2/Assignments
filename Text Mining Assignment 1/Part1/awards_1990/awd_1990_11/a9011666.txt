Abstract    :
                   The purpose of project is to investigate the effect of                    
              corporate debt-related restructuring (that is, mergers,                        
              acquisitions, leverage buyouts) on research and development in                 
              the U.S. over the period 1977-86.  The extent of merger activity               
              in high- versus low-technology industries will be evaluated.                   
              Four large data bases will be integrated and refined as part of                
              the research effort:  the Census Quarterly Financial Report, the               
              Census Longitudinal Research Data (Survey of Manufacturers), the               
              National Science Foundation/Census Research and Development data,              
              and a comprehensive list of LBOs and other restructurings                      
              (derived largely from Mergers & Acquisitions data).                            
                   The project will provide statistical data, definitional                   
              rigor, and the methodological approach for analyzing the                       
              relationship between R&D funding and other economic variables.                 
              The results should provide further understanding of the role of                
              industrial R&D activity in promoting national economic growth and              
              competitiveness, and thereby contribute to the Foundation's                    
              responsibility to provide for the collection and interpretation                
              of data for science and technology policy formulation.
