Abstract    :
              This is a joint project between the University of Colorado and the             
              consulting engineering firm of Atkinson-Noland and Associates, Inc.            
              of Boulder, Colorado, in cooperation with engineers from Italy and             
              Yugoslavia.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              The project will investigate the lateral load resistance of                    
              masonry-infilled reinforced concrete structures to determine the               
              feasibility of using the method to reinforce existing reinforced               
              concrete buildings and to evaluate the safety of existing                      
              buildings.
