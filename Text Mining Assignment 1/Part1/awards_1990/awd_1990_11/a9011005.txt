Abstract    :
              The principal goal of this research is to understand how                       
              institutional, ecological, and regulatory factors combine to                   
              influence characteristics of organizations and of populations of               
              organizations.  This study will examine competing environmental                
              approaches to understanding organizations.  Population ecology                 
              theory, institutional theory, and hypotheses about the direct                  
              effects of regulatory changes on firms will be examined using                  
              longitudinal data from 1825 through 1925 on several hundred                    
              Massachusetts railway firms.  The Commonwealth collected                       
              extensive annual data from all chartered railways that will                    
              facilitate the comparison of competing hypotheses about                        
              organizational foundings and failures, and about an array of                   
              internal firm characteristics such as administrative ratios and                
              the presence of particular functional divisions.
