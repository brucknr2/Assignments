Abstract    :
                   This proposal deals with the development of statistical                   
              methodology for the study of compositional vectors subject to the              
              important constraint that the components, representing                         
              proportions of some whole, must sum to unity.  Professor                       
              Aitchison will continue his development of transformation                      
              techniques for the solution of a number of new practical problems              
              peculiar to compositional data, such as estimation from                        
              amalgamated compositions, joints variability of major-oxide and                
              trace-element compositions, the mixing of compositions and the                 
              relationship of multivariate count and compositional                           
              distributions.  In conjuction with the methodological development              
              improved software for compositional data analysis will be                      
              produced.
