Abstract    :
                   Professor Papanicolaou will use probabilistic and analytic                
              methods to investigate certain questions concerning the                        
              Schroedinger equation.  He will try to estimate the total size of              
              the gaps in the spectrum of a Schroedinger operator with a                     
              bounded and smooth potential.  He will study the dependence of                 
              zeroes of the Green's function on the spatial and spectral                     
              variables.  He has defined a complex rotation number for                       
              multidimensional Schroedinger operators and will now investigate               
              its geometric properties.  In addition he will investigate the                 
              short time asymptotic behavior of heat kernels and apply the                   
              results to inverse problems.                                                   
                   The Schroedinger equation finds its most useful application               
              in nonrelativistic quantum physics but is also an area of                      
              intensive investigation from a pure mathematics point of view.                 
              In the realm of physics, this equation describes a tremendously                
              wide variety of systems, from simple atoms and molecules to large              
              aggregates like a piece of glass or a superconductor.  The                     
              research described above will help in the understanding of such                
              systems by providing a more thorough comprehension of the basic                
              mathematics which describe these systems.
