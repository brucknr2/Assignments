Abstract    :
                This research will study the detailed source processes of the                
              Loma Prieta earthquake using a combined teleseismic data set                   
              including teleseismic broad-band and short-period body waves and               
              strong motion data near the source.  To simulate the highest                   
              frequency energy radiated by the mainshock, the research will                  
              include the analysis of aftershocks used as empirical Green's                  
              functions.  By means of this technique, details of the main shock              
              rupture surface will be mapped.  This research is a component of               
              the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
