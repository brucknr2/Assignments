                  This project is producing an Etymological Dictionary and                  
              Thesaurus of Sino-Tibetan (ST), comprising Chinese and its                     
              hundreds of relatives in the Tibeto-Burman (TB) family.  The                   
              organization of STEDT is by semantic fields, ultimately yielding               
              a thesaurus of the proto-lexicon.                                              
                                                                                             
                   During the first grant period (1987-90), vast databases of                
              ST lexical and etymological material were created, incorporating               
              over 110 published and unpublished sources (some solicited by                  
              questionnaire).  As of January 1990, the database contained over               
              75,000 quality-controlled records.                                             
                                                                                             
                   The first fascicle of STEDT (to be completed by the end of                
              1990-91) is devoted to body-part terminology.  Several hundred                 
              etyma have already been provisionally reconstructed in this key                
              semantic area, most for the first time.  As the basic work of                  
              database creation and management is perfected, the rate of                     
              fascicle production will accelerate.                                           
                                                                                             
                   The STEDT project is an excellent training groud for                      
              students of SE Asian linguistics and computerized lexicography.                
              The P.I. regularly conducts training seminars on historical                    
              semantics and comparative reconstruction.                                      
                                                                                             
                   This work sheds light on ancient cultural patterns and                    
              thought-processes, and on long-standing puzzles about genetic vs.              
              contact relationship in East and Southeast Asia.  The STEDTS                   
              software will be readily adaptable for etymological work in other              
              language families.
