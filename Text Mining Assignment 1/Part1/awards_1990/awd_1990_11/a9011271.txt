Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a three.year collaborative Research project                            
              between Dr. George Keulks, University of Wisconsin                             
              at Milwaukee and Dr. C. S. Fang of Institute of                                
              Physics, Academia Sinica, Taiwan, sponsored by the                             
              AIT.CCNAA Cooperative Science Program.  This                                   
              proposal was submitted by Dr. David Tong, who was a                            
              NSF Program Director for the Condensed Matter                                  
              Theory Program.  Because NSF does not allow                                    
              previous program officers to negotiate with the                                
              Foundation within a year of the person's departure,                            
              Dr. George Keulks replaces Dr. Tong as a P. I. for                             
              this proposal.  This proposal plans to study the                               
              formation of metal semiconductor interfaces and                                
              subsequent growth of semiconductor substrates.                                 
              The Institute of Physics Academia Sinica in Taiwan                             
              has invested more than 1 million dollars in the                                
              acquisition of state.of.the.art ultra.high vacuum                              
              spectroscopic instruments, which are essential in                              
              making experimental measurements for testing Tong's                            
              semiconductor structure model.  At present,                                    
              Taiwan's Institute of Physics is one of the few                                
              places where such measurements can be made and only                           
              place which makes experimental measurements on the                            
              metal, Ga.  This study can expand our understanding                            
              of surface structure, which is essential in the                                
              development of new and advanced materials, many                                
              which have been used for making computer chips and                             
              other electronics.
