Abstract    :
              The proposed research will examine the changing relationships                  
              between work and family behaviors among Puerto Rican women,                    
              employing both a life course and cohort perspective.  The focus                
              is on entry into adult roles (marital, parental, and labor force)              
              and the consequences of these early adult transitions.  The PIs                
              will analyze the detailed retrospective life histories of over                 
              3,000 Puerto Rican women aged 15 to 49 in 1982, interviewed in                 
              the Puerto Rico Fertility and family Planning Assessment survey.               
              They will compare the early adult experiences of different age                 
              cohorts of women who reached adulthood between the 1950s and the               
              1970s, the period of most rapid social and economic change in                  
              Puerto Rico.  Because of improved opportunities for women outside              
              the home, the investigators expect to find marked changes in the               
              timing and nature of women's early work and family behavior and                
              that the effects of such changes will be greater for younger                   
              women.  The proposed combined cohort and life course perspective               
              has not previously been applied to the study of Puerto Rican                   
              women, a relatively low-income population experiencing rapid                   
              industrialization.  By examining both their productive and                     
              reproductive roles from this perspective, the proposed study                   
              should contribute significantly to our limited understanding of                
              life course dynamics and the impact of economic development on                 
              women.
