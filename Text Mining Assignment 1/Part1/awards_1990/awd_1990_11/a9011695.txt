Abstract    :
              The History of Science Society and the Society for the History of              
              Technology are organizing a Conference to be held Oct. 31 to Nov.              
              3, 1991 in Madison, Wisconsin on "Critical Problems and Research               
              Frontiers in History of Science and History of Technology."  This              
              conference is being held in conjunction with the annual meetings               
              of the two societies.  The planning for this conference was                    
              supported under DIR-8912577.  The conference will bring together               
              leaders of both fields from around the world in order to discuss               
              the issues to be addressed at the meeting.   Each society is                   
              sponsoring symposia that cut across time periods and geographic                
              boundaries, and provide important comparative insights on the                  
              development of science and technology.  Similarly, sessions devoted            
              to methodologies should stimulate new kinds of research and shed               
              light on the boundaries of history of science and history of                   
              technology from closely related fields.  Plenary sessions are                  
              intended to address issues of common concern to all historians of              
              science and of technology.  The papers are being distributed prior             
              to the meeting.  The discussions at the conference will be                     
              transcribed and a final volume of the papers and salient points of             
              the discussion will be published.
