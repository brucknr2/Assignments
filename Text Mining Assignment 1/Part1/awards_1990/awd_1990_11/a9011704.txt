Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will support the research of a cultural anthropologist              
              in developing a large database (over 200 cases) of irrigation                  
              systems from about 20 nations.  These cases will be measured on                
              several variables, including size and structure of authority.                  
              Previous work show no relationship between size and political                  
              centralization between 700 and 458,000 Hectares.  The                          
              relationship between size and structure of authority will be                   
              investigated in the new and larger sample.  Additional variables               
              include information on climate, nature of irrigation, type of                  
              agriculture, and type of national political system, should                     
              account for some of the variation. Results should be of interest               
              to management theorists and policy makers who must deal with                   
              irrigation projects which are not performing up to standards.
