Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The principal investigator will study range and kernel                    
              properties of various examples of Radon transformations.  He will              
              further analyze relationships between the algebras of invariant                
              differential operators on symmetric spaces and bi-invariant                    
              differential operators on the isometry group.  A second                        
              investigator will study unipotent representations, particularly                
              their unitary character as well as the relationship of these                   
              representations to Dixmier algebras and their characters.                      
                   Two investigators will study problems related to the theory               
              of differential operators.  An operator is a function from one                 
              set back to itself.  In this case these sets are themselves                    
              collections of functions.  Specifically, differential operators                
              carry functions to their derivatives.  These investigators will                
              use ideas from both analysis and geometry to extend their                      
              understanding of these and other operators.
