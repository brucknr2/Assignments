Abstract    :
              This project attempts to advance theoretical understanding of                  
              problem solving in a multiple agent environment, as applied to a               
              resource allocation problem.  The research is cast in a decision               
              theoretic framework.  It explores the process of decision making               
              where: a) information is obtained about the preference profiles                
              of each agent; b) the information acquired is then used as a                   
              basis for finding socially optimal resource allocation that                    
              maximize total net welfare, and; c) the costs involved in                      
              acquiring information are considered an integral part of the                   
              process.  The objective of the research is to deal with the                    
              following specific issues: 1) the study of various  communication              
              patterns and strategies for information gathering and various                  
              system topologies for team decision making; 2) the investigation               
              of the incorporation of computational costs, and the tradeoff                  
              between the relative cost and time of computation versus                       
              communication for effective management of resources; 3) the study              
              of the problems concerning incentive compatibility; 4) the                     
              investigation of alternative goals to finding a socially optimal               
              resource allocation; 5) the examination of the static resource                 
              allocation problem, versus the dynamic one, with incremental                   
              addition and deletion of resources.  Results of this                           
              investigation should have significance, not only for the                       
              practical use of decision theoretic models, but also in providing              
              insights into research fundamental to the design and use of                    
              computer and communication systems to coordinate work and                      
              decision making.
