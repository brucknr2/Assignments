Abstract    :
                   The goal of this research is to study coherent structures                 
              in geophysical flow by determining equilibrium solutions of the                
              quasigeostrophic vorticity equation.  The system of equations                  
              is solved numerically using the Newton-Kantorovich algorithm                   
              and the stability properties of the solutions analyzed using                   
              both time integration studies and a dynamical systems approach.                
                   The results of this work will be applied to the phenomenon                
              of atmospheric blocking, that is, the situation in which the                   
              planetary scale waves of the atmosphere maintain a stable                      
              configuration which causes weather patterns to persist for                     
              weeks at a time.  Modeling of the blocking process will examine                
              the generation, maintenance, and decay of the blocks.  This                    
              research has obvious implications for improving medium range                   
              weather forecasting.                                                           
                   The PI is well qualified for this project.  She is an                     
              applied mathematician with background in fluid mechanics and                   
              atmospheric and oceanographic sciences.  This award is being                   
              made as a Research Initiation Award and is jointly funded by
