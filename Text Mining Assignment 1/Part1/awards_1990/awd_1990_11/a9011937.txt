Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The investigator proposes to study pictorial priming by                        
              using a task previously investigated and published by him.                     
              In general, the subject under study will be offered primes                     
              in a series of whole pictures and they will be tested using                    
              a series of degraded pictures as target items.  The subject                    
              will receive three identical primes, three similar primes                      
              and three pictures that have not been presented during the                     
              priming portion of the task.  Male and female subjects and                     
              the picture feature types contour will be used in the study.                   
              The pictures a subject receives during the target series                       
              will be either identical in spatial orientation to the                         
              prime offered in the first portion of the task or will be a                    
              mirror-image in terms of spatial orientation.  The subjects                    
              performance will be recorded in terms of time to solve the                     
              degraded form and the number of keystrokes to solve the                        
              degraded form.  The investigator hopes to determine if                         
              performance is affected by the slowing of the visual system                    
              that might occur with aging.
