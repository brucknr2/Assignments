Abstract    :
              It is often necessary to characterize the low-frequency                        
              mechanical behavior of physiological systems. For                              
              example, the impedance describing pressure/flow                                
              characteristics is a common means of quantitating the                          
              overall mechanical behavior of the pulmonary system.  The                      
              proposed work is a basic theoretical investigation into                        
              the best techniques to derive the most reliable                                
              information from the least number of experiments.  A                           
              realistic mathematical "forward" model will be used to                         
              evaluate signal analysis and system identification                             
              techniques using rigorous statistical techniques.  The                         
              research should lead to better technology for                                  
              physiological systems identification, and it may lead to                       
              improved diagnostic procedures.
