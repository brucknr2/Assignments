Abstract    :
              This research is concerned with the study of a variety of                      
              problems of current interest in surface physics.  These include:               
              1) the study of the multilayer structure of the simplest (rare                 
              gas) films as well as novel structures in molecular monolayers;                
              2) the observation of collective vibrational excitations in                    
              quasi-two-dimensional molecular solids and their analysis to                   
              infer intermolecular and molecule substrate interactions; and 3)               
              the study of phase transitions in adsorbed films which either do               
              not occur in bulk solids, or which may be more tractible                       
              theoretically in low dimensions.  The experiments will employ                  
              inelastic and quasielastic neutron scattering to investigate                   
              monolayer dynamics and both elastic neutron diffraction and                    
              synchrotron x-ray scattering to probe film structure.
