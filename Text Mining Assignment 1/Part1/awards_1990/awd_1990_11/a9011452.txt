Abstract    :
                This research is to analyze the crustal deformation of the                   
              region close to the Loma Prieta earthquake by using data                       
              collected by the U.S. Geological Survey: one source will be the                
              geodolite trilateration network measured since the early 1970's,               
              another source will be the Global Positioning System network that              
              has been surveyed since 1985.  In addition to the experiments                  
              near Loma Prieta, GPS readings will be taken in cooperation with               
              the USGS at triangulation sites that were surveyed in the San                  
              Francisco Bay Area in the years 1882 to 1887 and in 1906.  These               
              measurements will enable the determination of how the 1989 loma                
              Prieta earthquake differed from the 1906 San Francisco                         
              earthquake.  This research is a component of the National                      
              Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
