Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal seeks to continue the PI's research program on the               
              antecedents and prediction of divorce.  The PI's previous work                 
              investigated the causes and prevention of marital distress.  In                
              this earlier work, the PI found that males' withdrawal from                    
              conflict was the best predictor of divorce.  The present work                  
              will follow the PI's earlier research respondents into their                   
              child rearing stage, to see how marital distress affects                       
              children.  The research will assess the relation between affect                
              regulation in marriage and in the parent child relationship (how               
              is withdrawal in the marriage related to withdrawal from the                   
              child?).  The effects of children on marital satisfaction and                  
              interaction also will be examined.                                             
                                                                                             
              In addition, divorced spouses will also be studied in their new                
              relationships, to determine if dysfunctional patterns are                      
              repeated in second marriages.                                                  
                                                                                             
              This research is focused on a critically important issue for                   
              American society.  It is theory based, rigorous, and beautifully               
              designed.  Markman has proved himself in this arena, and deserves              
              further funding.
