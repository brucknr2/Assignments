Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Surface diffusivity and surface free energy of metals are                      
              important physical quantities in phenomena such as nucleation                  
              and growth, corrosion, and fracture.  Values of these parameters               
              appropriate for ambient temperature behavior are based on linear               
              extrapolations of high temperature measurements.  This program                 
              examines a new measurement technique for direct observation of                 
              surface mobilities using the scanning tunneling microscope.  Such              
              measurements need to be done on extremely well characterized                   
              surfaces, taking into account surface segregation and effect of                
              electrolyte composition.  Consideration of temperature dependence              
              of the surface parameters is considered high risk as it requires               
              new scanning tunneling microscopy techniques.
