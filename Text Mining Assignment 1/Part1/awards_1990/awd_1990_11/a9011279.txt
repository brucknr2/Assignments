Abstract    :
                                                                                              
               An autonomous Administrative Domain (AD) is a set of resources               
              such as host computers, networks, and gateways, that is governed               
              by a single administrative authority.  Interconnections across                 
              ADs comes about through interconnection of private networks and                
              by dividing an internet that has grown too large to manage.                    
                                                                                             
                Common approaches to network interconnection create a fully                  
              connected internet out of the constituent networks.  Network                   
              access control mechanisms have been designed for use in inter-AD               
              gateways to control access to end-systems in interconnected                    
              networks.  When networks are used for transit purposes as well as              
              for access to end-systems, however, these network access control               
              mechanisms are not adequate.                                                   
                                                                                             
                In this project critical aspects of the design, specification,               
              and prototype implementation of a first Inter-Domain Policy                    
              Routing protocol suite will be developed.  Initial                             
              experimentation will carried out in the University of Southern                 
              California computer science laboratory and will subsequently be                
              tested over actual, cross-country, multi-administrative domain                 
              facilities.                                                                    
                                                                                             
                Thus, by incorporating policy-related contraints on inter-AD                 
              communication into route computation, this research provides for               
              essential maintenance and improvement of the research Internet                 
              and the research infrastructure it provides to scientists and                  
              engineers.***//
