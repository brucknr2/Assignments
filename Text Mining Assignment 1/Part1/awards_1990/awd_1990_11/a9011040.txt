Abstract    :
                   This research falls under the broad headings of symplectic                
              geometry and geometric quantization.  In addition to its                       
              geometric content, it involves both algebraic theory and                       
              analysis; and aside from it purely mathematical interest, it is                
              of considerable interest to mathematical physics.  The research                
              is divided into five topics:  (1) the geometric quantization of                
              the Marsden-Weinstein reduced phase spaces; (2) the geometric                  
              quantization of the symplectic tori; (3) symplectic spinors and                
              half-forms for infinite-dimensional symplectic vector spaces and               
              polarizations; (4) the structure and representation theory of the              
              algebra generated by the canonical commutation relations in                    
              exponential form; and (5) the structure and representation theory              
              of commutative Poisson algebras.                                               
                   This research is in the general area of geometric algebra                 
              and mathematical physics.  Its aim is to investigate aspects of                
              symplectic geometry, in particular aspects pertaining to                       
              geometric quantization.
