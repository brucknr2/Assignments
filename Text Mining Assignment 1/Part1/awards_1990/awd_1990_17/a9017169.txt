Abstract    :
              Redoubt Volcano, Alaska has been in a state of eruption since                  
              December 1984.  This exploratory research project is for                       
              deployment of a portable observatory to obtain badly needed                    
              ground-truth information.                                                      
              A unique research opportunity exists at present at Redoubt                     
              Volcano to learn much about eruptive processes, glacier-volcano                
              interaction and interpretation of seismicity at an active                      
              andesitic volcano.  Most of the needed equipment (Seismographs,                
              TV cameras and radios) have already been purchased by AVO and                  
              W.M. Keck Foundation funds.  Separate funding is available for                 
              additional equipment, publication charges etc.                                 
              The building would be located on ice on a 4000' high ridge 14 km               
              north of the volcano.  It has a double roof for protection                     
              against possible pumice bombs and researches would dig a bomb                  
              shelter in the ice for the unlikely event of a very strong                     
              explosion.                                                                     
              The seismicity is so high at present that even in a short, e.g.,               
              10 day, observation window, one could learn a lot about the                    
              physical processes that cause the great variety of ground                      
              vibrations.                                                                    
              The budget is for 1 month of P.I. time, helicopter deployment of               
              the hut and basic video and photographic equipment.  Additional                
              costs for the experiment will be covered by AVO as matching funds              
              for this NSF Grant.
