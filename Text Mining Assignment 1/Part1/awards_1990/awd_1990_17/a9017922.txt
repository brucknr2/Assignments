Abstract    :
                   This study will continue analysis of fold development in                  
              single layers by use of computer modelling and by the study of                 
              natural folds.  The aim is to better understand folding processes              
              in non-linear materials, in layers oriented oblique to the                     
              principal bulk strain directions, and in layers that undergo non-              
              coaxial strain.  Finite element models will be used to study                   
              variations in shape and strain distribution in symmetrical folds               
              as functions of viscosity contrast, power-law exponent, initial                
              shape, and initial wavelength of the layers.  A comparison will be             
              made between the development of symmetrical folds & that of                    
              asymmetrical folds that develop either in simple shear or in                   
              oblique layers subjected to pure shear.  Criteria will be                      
              developed, based on fold shape and strain, that will give                      
              information on bulk deformation paths in rocks.  Natural folds will            
              be studied for arc length vs. thickness distribution, fold shape,              
              and strain pattern.  These data from natural folds will be compared            
              with the experimental data in order to gain insight on their                   
              rheology during deformation.  The results of this study will                   
              greatly improve our understanding of rock behavior during tectonic             
              folding.
