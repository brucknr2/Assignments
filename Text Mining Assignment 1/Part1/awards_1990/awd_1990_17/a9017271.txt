Abstract    :
                   The North Armorican Massif is part of the Armorican Plate that            
              separated from N. America, Baltica and Gondwana in the early                   
              Paleozoic.  Large segments of Armorica were affected by the late               
              Precambrian Cadomian orogeny, and the massif is one of very few                
              areas where there is no apparent overprinting of Cadomian aged                 
              rocks during the late Paleozoic Variscan orogeny.  This area is                
              thus critical for resolution of tectonic linkages with correlative             
              Avalonian and/or Pan-African sequences.  Existing models for the               
              Cadomian orogeny have a limited geochemical data base, although                
              recent field work has shown that complex polyphase Precambrian                 
              metamorphic/structural events occurred.  This study will make                  
              systematic determination of 40Ar/39Ar mineral ages and selected U-Pb           
              zircon ages from representative lithological units within the                  
              massif, and will be conducted in collaboration with British field              
              geologists working in the area.  Co-operation with local French                
              geologists has been arranged.  The results of this research will               
              permit detailed evaluation of Precambrian tectonothermal events and            
              will help constrain tectonic models for the region.
