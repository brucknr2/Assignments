Abstract    :
              The University-National Laboratory System (UNOLS) fleet of                     
              research vessels, operated by academic institutions, provides                  
              support services to those NSF sponsored researchers who require                
              time at sea to complete their investigations.  All of these ships              
              use oceanographic wire rope as part of this research support.                  
              Arrangements have been made which allow bulk purchases of wire                 
              rope resulting in considerable cost savings.                                   
                                                                                             
              Twelve reels of torque balanced wire rope will be purchased.  The              
              wire rope is stored until needed by ship operators at the Woods                
              Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) on the east coast and at                 
              the Scripps Institution of Oceanography on the west coast.                     
                                                                                             
              Mr. Donald A. Moller, Marine Operations Coordinator, WHOI, will                
              manage this project.
