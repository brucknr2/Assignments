Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The way the magnetic field of the earth connects with the                      
              interplanetary magnetic field is an interesting and important                  
              problem for understanding the near-earth space environment. Field              
              lines from the polar cap do not close at the opposite pole of the              
              earth when they emanate from higher magnetic latitudes than a                  
              boundary called the separatrix, but rather connect with the                    
              interplanetary field. Flow of mass and energy across this                      
              boundary gives mass and energy flow between open and closed field              
              lines, and drives the majority of magnetospheric processes. The                
              energy involved comes almost entirely from the solar wind. This                
              project seeks to initiate a large-scale study of an important                  
              related phenomenon called the magnetospheric reconnection rate                 
              under a variety of geophysical conditions using ionospheric                    
              observations from the Sonderstrom incoherent scatter radar. The                
              investigators have developed a technique that shows great                      
              promise of allowing the measurement of plasma flow across the                  
              separatrix, and from this flow to determine the reconnection                   
              rate.
