Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Assimilation of sulfate-S is a central event in plant metabolism               
              and the formation of organosulfur compounds such as amino acids,               
              cofactors, and sulfolipid by the plant.  The research planned is               
              focused on sulfate activation that takes place on the inner                    
              mitochrondrial membrane of Euglena and the presumed, subsequent                
              transfer of activated S in some form to the chloroplast.  A                    
              critical assessment of sulfite's involvement in sulfolipid                     
              formation is another focus of this research.  The flow of sulfur               
              compounds from mitochondria to chloroplasts is an important part               
              of understanding the origin of chloroplast components during                   
              plastid development.                                                           
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
              The metabolic intermediates involved in conversion of assimilated              
              sulfate into the variety of S-containing compounds characteristic              
              of plant biomass are, in significant details, unclear; the research            
              planned is directed at understanding the extent to which sulfite               
              is an actual intermediate in such conversions, and at enlarging the            
              understanding of how a key enzyme involved in sulfate reduction                
              functions in cysteine biosynthesis.  This flow of sulfur is an                 
              important aspect of plastid development in plant growth.
