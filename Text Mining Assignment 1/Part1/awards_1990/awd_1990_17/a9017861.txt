Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Among the highest priority objectives of the Ocean Drilling                    
              Program are those which concern fluid circulation in the oceanic               
              crust and sediments, including studies of hydrothermal processes               
              associated with crustal accretion and aging and of                             
              hydrogeological systems at accretionary margins. Fluid                         
              circulation in the crust and sediments controls the alteration of              
              crustal chemistry, transports heat and alteration products, and                
              plays a controlling role in determining physical properties of                 
              margin sediment sequences.                                                     
                                                                                             
              As permeability is the key physical property that directly                     
              controls fluid circulation, its measurement in situ and the                    
              determination of its variation with depth in various                           
              hydrogeological settings is an important objective. This award                 
              will acquire and deploy a recently developed technique for making              
              rapid and detailed measurements in boreholes. Although developed               
              for continental drilling, the injection/flowmeter technique                    
              should be adaptable for use from the JOIDES Resolution and will                
              give a more continuous and detailed record of permeability than                
              is presently available.                                                        
                                                                                             
              The principal investigators have extensive backgrounds in                      
              permeability studies and in developing techniques for downhole                 
              measurements in both continental and oceanic boreholes.
