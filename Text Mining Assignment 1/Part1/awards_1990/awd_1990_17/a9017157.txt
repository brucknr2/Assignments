Abstract    :
                   The power and utility of pleomagnetic analyses stem from the              
              ability to quantify such parameters as the degree of rotation of               
              a rock body, or the orientation of an anisotropy axis.  However                
              estimates for uncertainty in these paleomagnetic data have been                
              difficult to measure due to possibly inappropriate assumptions                 
              about how the data and naturally distributed.  In many                         
              geologically important situations the commonly used parametric                 
              distribution functions fail to adequately model the data, leading              
              to unreliable uncertainty estimate.  This project will use                     
              several resampling techniques that are relatively free of                      
              restrictive assumptions to attempt to better detail the best                   
              estimate for the true direction for paleomagnetic directional                  
              data sets in a variety of geological applications.  Results are                
              potentially applicable to error estimates in a wide range of                   
              geological applications in addition to paleomagnetically                       
              determined orientation data.
