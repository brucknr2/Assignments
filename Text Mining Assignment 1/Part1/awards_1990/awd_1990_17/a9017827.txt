Abstract    :
              This award is for support of a study to establish a                            
              quantitative nuclear method for determination of Antarctic                     
              ablation and accumulation rates and to provide correction                      
              factors for the carbon 14 ages of ice samples dated using                      
              trapped carbon 14.  Recent studies have established the                        
              presence of cosmogenic in-situ produced carbon 14 in polar                     
              ice.  In conjunction with estimated carbon 14 production                       
              rates, measured concentrations of carbon 14 per gram of ice                    
              yield, ablation rates which are in good agreement with the                     
              values determined from stake measurements.  Similar studies                    
              to determine accumulation rates have been tested and the                       
              estimates are consistent with previous studies.                                
                                                                                             
              This study will expand the preliminary work done to date in                    
              order to improve the 14CO and 14CO2 vacuum extraction                          
              techniques, by lowering blank levels and by obtaining more                     
              complete separation of 14CO and 14CO2.
