Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Recent investigations have shown that Fe may limit                             
              phytoplankton growth in oceanic regions, and thus may be a key                 
              factor linking marine biological production to climate.                        
              Quantitative analysis of this iron hypothesis requires                         
              assessing the Fe-demand in oceanic phytoplankton.  The iron                    
              demand of oceanic phytoplankton can be estimated only if the                   
              Fe-nutritional requirement of the population is known a priori.                
              Dr. Welschmeyer will relate an organism's Fe-compositional                     
              ratio with its Fe-nutritional status.  The results will shed                   
              additional light on the factors controlling primary                            
              productivity in the ocean.
