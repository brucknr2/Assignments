Abstract    :
              The objective of this research is the demonstration of the                     
              practical validity of measuring electric potential in the                      
              atmosphere using several kites attached to a common tether.  If                
              this technique is successful, a simple and relatively                          
              inexpensive method will be available to monitor continuously                   
              electric potential and, by inference, that of the                              
              earth.ionosphere system. The measurements will be conducted on                 
              Christmas Island, Republic of Kiribati.
