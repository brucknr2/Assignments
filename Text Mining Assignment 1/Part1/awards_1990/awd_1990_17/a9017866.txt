Abstract    :
              In collaboration with a Mexican colleague the PIs are conducting               
              an integrated geological, petrological, and geochemical study of               
              Miocene to Recent volcanic rocks from a transect across the                    
              southernmost Basin and Range Province (BRP) of central Mexico.                 
              The plan is to extend this work in the transect area by                        
              conducting a comprehensive petrological and geochemical study of               
              mantle-derived spinel-lherzolite xenoliths.  Major-element                     
              analyses of whole-rock samples and constituent minerals will                   
              enable the PIs to evaluate petrogenetic models for the xenoliths               
              as residues of partial melting of fertile peridotitic mantle and               
              to evaluate regional differences in upper-mantle composition,                  
              temperature, oxygen fugacity, and degree of melt extraction.                   
              They also plan to conduct detailed studies of Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic                
              ratios and trace-element abundances in clinopyroxenes, which will              
              allow them to investigate complex metasomatic modifications of                 
              the upper-mantle geochemistry by fluid/melts, such as those                    
              related to the Tertiary subduction event and those related to on-              
              going lithospheric extension.
