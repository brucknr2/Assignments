Abstract    :
                   The proposed research investigates thermal, species, and                  
              hydrodynamic transport relevant to solidification of liquid metals.            
              These coupled processes occur within the liquid melt during                    
              solidification and modify heat and species transport rates at the              
              solid-mushy-liquid interfaces, inducing changes in the                         
              solidification rate and, ultimately, variations in the mechanical              
              and electrical properties of the finished product.                             
              %%%                                                                            
                   The overall objective of this proposal is to increase our                 
              understanding of heat and mass transfer processes relevant to                  
              solidification of liquid metals with a primarily experimental                  
              approach. The most creative feature of this research is the                    
              utilization of neutron radiography to visualize and measure various            
              transport-related processes within the molten metal during                     
              solidification of pure metals or metallic alloys.
