Abstract    :
                   This study will determine the absolute plate velocity of the              
              Izanagi Plate of the Western Paleo Pacific during the early                    
              Cretaceous.  Preliminary modelling suggests that the Izanagi Plate             
              reached velocities as high as 20 cm/yr, substantially faster than              
              those of present day plates.  An independent measure of the Izanagi            
              Plate motion will be obtained from paleomagnetic study of an                   
              accreted oceanic rise in the Tokoro belt of Hokkaido, Japan,                   
              thought to be a remnant of the plate.  The Tokoro belt comprises               
              pillow basalts and flows, radiolarian chert, pelagic limestone, and            
              overlying continentally-derived rocks.  Preliminary paleomagnetic              
              data from the Tokoro belt suggests an equatorial origin for the                
              pelagic limestones and implies a minimum plate velocity of 13                  
              cm/yr.  A thorough paleomagnetic investigation of the Tokoro belt              
              will be undertaken to determine the absolute plate velocity of the             
              Izanagi Plate.  The results will provide fundamental new data on               
              accretion rates at continental margins and will provide necessary              
              constraints for modelling of plate-driving mechanisms.
