Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a two-year collaborative project between Hsien-Kei                     
              Cheng of the University of California, Los Angeles, and Luo                    
              Shijun of Northwestern Polytechnic University, Xi'an, China.                   
              It is sponsored jointly by the NSF and the Northwestern                        
              Polytechnic University.                                                        
                                                                                             
              A combined CFD-asymptotic study is proposed to investigate                     
              several unresolved, nonlinear aspects and related issues in                    
              the theory and application of equivalence rules involving                      
              lift.  Among the topics to be considered are new aspects of                    
              transonic and supersonic equivalence rules involving a                         
              nonlinear near field and the use/development of Euler and                      
              Navier-Stockes solutions via domain decomposition (and                         
              programming parallelism), with the main objective of                           
              ascertaining the degree to which shocks and flow in the near                   
              field can affect the rule's validity/applicability.  Included                  
              is also a computer-program development for a 3-D transonic                     
              small-disturbance equation with the specific purpose of                        
              applying the equivalence rule for predicting shock loss in                     
              the far field, which is unavailable heretofore.  Among the                     
              configurations to be analyzed are wind-tunnel test models,                     
              for which drag and flow-field data are available for                           
              comparison, as well as oblique, all-wing designs, of which                     
              the performance gain with a nonlinear near field is most                       
              apparent.
