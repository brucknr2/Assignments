Abstract    :
              This award supports continued study of the paleontology of                     
              Seymour Island, Antarctica.  The award will allow data                         
              reduction to complete the ongoing taxonomic study of the                       
              Late Cretaceous early Tertiary molluscan fauna collected                       
              during previous U.S. sponsored expeditions and recently                        
              collected material during a joint Argentine-American                           
              expedition.  The systematic review of the bivalves component                   
              of the fauna has been completed.  It is anticipated that                       
              with the completion of this work, a detailed data base for                     
              the late Cretaceous/early Tertiary of Antarctica will                          
              provide new insight not only into the nature of the faunal                     
              turnover in the high southern latitudes at the end of the                      
              Cretaceous, but also in to the recovery of the marine faunas                   
              during the early Tertiary.  These data will provide a solid                    
              foundation for integrating ongoing biogeographic studies in                    
              South America and Australia.
