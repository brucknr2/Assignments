Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The objective of this proposal is to further our understanding of              
              the ontogeny of hematopoietic stem cells and their contribution to             
              the developing thymus.  This will be accomplished by experimentally            
              manipulating embryonic stem cells followed by injection of these               
              stem cells into intact, cytogenetically distinct larval hosts.                 
              The contribution of the injected stem cells to the developing                  
              hematopoietic system will be monitored using flow cytometry.  The              
              results of these experiments will indicate when lymphoid precursors            
              differentiate during embryogenesis and if there are differential               
              contributions from embryonic stem cell compartments to the                     
              developing thymus and other peripheral hematopoietic tissues.  The             
              commitment of undifferentiated mesoderm to hematopoiesis appears               
              to be associated with the expression of a surface molecule which               
              may be a member of the Leukocyte Common Antigen family of protein              
              tyrosine phosphatase receptors.  It is important to establish the              
              functional role and phylogenetic conservation of this family of                
              signal transduction molecules.                                                 
                                                                                             
              Although Xenopus is a phylogenetically primitive vertebrate, many              
              aspects of its hematopoietic and immune systems are similar to more            
              recently evolved species.  Thus the proposed investigations of the             
              immunobiology of this organism may provide useful insights into                
              both the ontogeny and evolution of vertebrate defense mechanisms.
