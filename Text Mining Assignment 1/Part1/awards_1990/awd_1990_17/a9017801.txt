Abstract    :
              The DNAs encapsidated by parvoviruses show distinctly different                
              patterns with respect to the ratio of plus to minus strands and the            
              preponderance of the flip as opposed to the flop conformation at               
              the termini.  We have developed a kinetic model for parvoviral DNA             
              replication, based on differential rates of hairpin transfer at the            
              3' termini that initiate replication, that accounts for the                    
              characteristics of the progeny virion DNA of the parvoviruses.  We             
              propose to test specific predictions of the model, thereby                     
              validating it or showing where it might need re-adjustment.  The               
              flip-flop ratio at the left end of the plus strand of Lulll will be            
              determined to distinguish between the kinetic hairpin transfer                 
              model and the modified rolling circle model, which requires a                  
              unique flip conformation at this location.  The polarity and flip-             
              flop ratios of progeny DNA of dimeric BPV genomes with duplicate or            
              inverted ends will be investigated and compared with computer                  
              predictions based on the relative rate constants for hairpin                   
              transfer associated with each terminus.  Site-directed mutagenesis             
              will eliminate "bubbles" associated with flip and flop                         
              conformations and the effect of these changes on replication and               
              progeny DNA characteristics seen.                                              
                                                                                             
              Conclusions from the projected work will result from the                       
              collaborative efforts of a biologist and a mathematician.  Neither             
              scientist could effectively undertake this project without the                 
              input of the other scientist.*** //
