Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will study a methanogen with unusual physiological                
              attributes--the inability to produce methane from either carbon                
              dioxide or acetate, but to do so from methanol provided that                   
              hydrogen is present.  Surprising is the fact that a great deal of              
              carbon of cell components is derived from acetate or carbon dioxide            
              and little from methanol; it is this latter aspect of biosynthesis             
              that is the focus of investigations that will use 13-C labelled                
              acetate or carbon dioxide, followed by high-resolution NMR studies,            
              to elucidate key carbon-entrance pathways using intact cells and               
              cell extracts.  Key enzymatic reactions and coenzyme requirements              
              of central reactions of the apparently unusual reduced one-carbon              
              biosynthetic pathway(s) will also be studied.                                  
                                                                                             
              The study of a physiologically-unusual methanogenic                            
              archaebacterium, with the goal of understanding the means by which             
              acetate and carbon dioxide carbon are built into cellular                      
              components is the focus of this project which involves                         
              collaboration between microbiologists and chemists.  //
