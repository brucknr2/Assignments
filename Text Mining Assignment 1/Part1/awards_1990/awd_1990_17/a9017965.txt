Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Combined analysis will continue with data collected from a trans-              
              Atlantic section at 11 Degrees North during March, 1989.                       
              Included are CTD profiles, water samples for chemical properties,              
              continuous near-surface currents from an ADCP, and subsurface                  
              flow from SOFAR floats.  Development of new techniques for                     
              synthesizing data will provide a better way to describe                        
              circulation in the Tropical Atlantic Ocean.
