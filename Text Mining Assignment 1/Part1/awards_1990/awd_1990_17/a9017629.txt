Abstract    :
                   This work will develop a generalized three-dimensional model              
              for the interaction of normal and strike-slip faults during                    
              continental extension.  The relationship between transverse                    
              structures (strike-slip faults) and detachment (normal) faults in              
              southern Nevada will be examined in detail, and a temporal and                 
              structural history will be established.  To accomplish this, an                
              integrated study will be conducted that involves geologic mapping,             
              geochronology, and seismic reflection profiling across both                    
              detachment and strike-slip faults.  This is a collaborative                    
              proposal with 9018301 which will concentrate on the seismic                    
              aspects.  Three classes of models will be tested:  strike-slip                 
              faults ar crust-penetrating, fundamental first order structures and            
              normal faults are secondary; detachment faults are first-order                 
              structures  and strike-slip faults are secondary transfer faults               
              in the shallow crust; and, strike-slip and normal faults are                   
              synchronous and allow extension to occur by the horizontal                     
              translation of crustal blocks.  The results of this study will                 
              provide fundamental three-dimensional information on the mechanisms            
              by which continental crust may extend, and as such have                        
              wide-reaching tectonic importance.
