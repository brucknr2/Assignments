Abstract    :
              High precision temperature and salinity profiles are some of                   
              the most commonly collected and important data in many ocean                   
              science investigations.  This work will develop a capability                   
              to solve a long standing problem in collecting such data at                    
              sea.  The response times of temperature sensors and                            
              conductivity sensors are significantly different, so data                      
              mismatches commonly occur when these sensors are                               
              simultaneously mounted on a CTD profiler.  A new calibration                   
              capability will investigate the dynamic response of commonly                   
              used thermometers and conductivity sensors.  Results will be                   
              used to improve present techniques for removing salinity                       
              errors arising from the mismatch in sensor time constants.                     
              The facility will be useful in testing probes prior to                         
              deployment and for developing new sensor systems.
