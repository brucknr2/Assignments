Abstract    :
              Abstract                                                                        
                  This work will involve a study of impulsive heating by                    
              current dissipation to help interpret the new vector magnetograph              
              and hard X-ray observations of solar flares proposed for the                   
              MAX'91 program.  Analyses of electron acceleration and bulk                    
              heating in the context of a single flux system have indicated                  
              that a simple current structure cannot in principle explain an                 
              impulsive x-ray burst.  These analyses are to be extended by                   
              calculating the heating (and possible electron acceleration)                   
              associated with a large-scale current sheet generated by                       
              interacting magnetic flux systems.  Such a calculation involves                
              the self-consistent solution of the time dependent current sheet               
              electron and ion energy equations.  The results of this research               
              will be compared with observations to determine if complex flare               
              geometries and current systems are truly a prerequisite for a                  
              solar flare.  ***
