Abstract    :
              Variations in the biologic productivity and ocean circulation over             
              the last 3 million years will be studied using 1350 samples taken              
              from two ODP sites on the Ontong-Java Plateau.  Measurements will              
              include 1)preservation and relative abundances of key planktonic               
              and benthic foraminifera; 2)d-018 for overall stratigraphic control            
              and vertical temperature gradients; and 3) d-C13 for history of                
              changes in carbon chemistry.  Of particular interest will be the               
              nature of the variations in these indices during critical glacial-             
              interglacial transitions.  Other points of interest will be the                
              history of upwelling/productivity in the western equatorial                    
              Pacific, the link between preservation spikes and abrupt ice                   
              melting, and the history of Pacific-Atlantic assymetry in the age              
              of deep water.  The link will be made between "true" global average            
              signal and climatic cycles measured in the North Atlantic.
