Abstract    :
              In this project the P.I.'s will continue development of a spatial              
              interpolation technique using arbitrary functions for separating               
              tidal currents from lower-frequency currents in shipboard Acoustic             
              Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) data.  The techniques will be                  
              further tested by applying them to data sets obtained in the                   
              region of the Amazon River outflow during the AMAzon Suspended                 
              SEDiment Study (AMASSEDS) and in the region of the California                  
              Current during the Shelf MIxed Layer Experiment (SMILE).
