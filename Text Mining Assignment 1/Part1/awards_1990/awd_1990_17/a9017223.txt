Abstract    :
              This research inolves the study of nonlinear phenomena in                      
              ferromagnetic thin films.  In thin films there are a samller number            
              of magneto-exchange modes which simplifies the comparison with                 
              theory because the truncation process (of the Hamiltonian) becomes             
              simpler.  The plan is to study samples with different thicknesses              
              thus having different densities of magnetostatic modes, determining            
              the dependences on magnetization, anisotropy energy, temperature               
              and frequency.  There will also be an effort to replace some of the            
              magnetic ions with nonmagnetic ions to study the effect on the                 
              spinwave dispersion coefficient.  In addition to mode locking and              
              modes suppression the effects of noise will also be investigated.              
              The analytical model will be extended to incorporate more modes to             
              obtain better results.  The effects of hidden modes will be                    
              considered, and the validity of the random phase approximation will            
              be examined, with the possibility of removing this requirement on              
              the non-excited modes.
