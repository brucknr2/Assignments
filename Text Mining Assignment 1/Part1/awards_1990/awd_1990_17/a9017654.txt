Abstract    :
              Single crystal x-ray crystallography coupled with a computer                   
              system is the most powerful analytical method for structure                    
              determination of solids.  In synthetic inorganic, organic,                     
              bioinorganic and organoetallic chemistry, single x-ray                         
              diffraction is an invaluable tool for characterizing molecular                 
              structure.  The information gained from the knowledge of the                   
              molecular composition and structure helps to develop new                       
              reactions of potentially general interest in catalysis or                      
              synthesis.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program                 
              will help the Department of Chemistry at Texas Christian                       
              University acquire a complete single crystal x-ray                             
              diffractometer system with a computer.  Among the areas of                     
              chemical research that will be enhanced by the acquisition are
