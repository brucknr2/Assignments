Abstract    :
              Many computational problems can be solved by searching through a               
              well-defined but huge space of candidates provided good                        
              heuristics are available to guide the search.  Thus automated                  
              discovery of search heuristics would have both practical and                   
              scientific importance.  In this approach, the generation of                    
              heuristics is modelled as the application of successive                        
              transformations to an initial problem specification.  This                     
              research addresses a number of issues raised by the long-term                  
              goal of scaling up to more realistic application domains.  To                  
              refine the model, studies of perturbation experiments aimed at                 
              understanding when and why it works will be carried out.  To                   
              enrich the space of generated heuristics, extensions and                       
              integration of transformations so as to rederive known scheduling              
              and routing heuristics and the discovery of new ones will be                   
              undertaken.  To explore this space more efficiently, novel                     
              methods for evaluating potential heuristics will be employed.                  
              Expected outcomes of this work include engineering advances in                 
              automated methods for discovering heuristics, as well as                       
              scientific advances in understanding their underlying principles.
