Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              This research will continue studies of pigment geochemistry to                 
              expand current analyses to include phycobilins, and to develop                 
              and synthesize a suitable pigment internal standard for HPLC                   
              pigment analysis.  Over the past three years photosynthetic                    
              pigments in suspended particulate matter and sediment trap                     
              samples collected from the Black Sea, and as part of legs 2, 3,                
              and 4 of the US JOGOFS NASBE has been analyzed.  The goal has                  
              been to determine the distribution of algal pigments in the                    
              euphotic zone and deep ocean, and to study the qualitative                     
              (transformation reactions) and quantitative aspects of the                     
              export flux to the sediment-water interface.  The present                      
              effort will bring this project to a logical conclusion.
