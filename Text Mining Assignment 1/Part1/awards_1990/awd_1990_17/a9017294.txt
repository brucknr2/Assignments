Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Mississippian Stanley Shale exposed in the Ouachita Mountains              
              of Arkansas and Oklahoma exhibits surprising bulk chemical                     
              characteristics that are probably related either to metamorphic                
              processes or to hydrothermal alteration.  The west to east                     
              increase in metamorphic grade seen in the Ouachitas is paralleled              
              by bulk chemical changes including depletion in Mg, Ca, Na, K,                 
              and Ba, and relative enrichment in Al and Li.  The increased Al                
              content is reflected in an increased abundance of aluminous                    
              phases such as chloritoid and pyrophyllite.  The changes in bulk               
              chemistry suggest that the Stanley may have exported material to               
              surrounding terrains.  It is necessary to evaluate the processes               
              that may  have led to the chemical and mineralogical changes                   
              recorded in the Ouachitas.  To do so involves a study of the                   
              differences in bulk chemistry, mineralogy, and fabric that exist               
              between diagenetic Stanley in the western Ouachitas and                        
              greenschist facies Stanley in the eastern Ouachitas.  In                       
              particular, this research will document changes in fabric, bulk                
              chemistry and isotopic tracers that may be useful in estimating                
              volume loss and evaluating the extent to which the Stanley was an              
              open system during diagenesis/metamorphism.
