Abstract    :
              This project addresses the uplift history of the                               
              Transantarctic Mountains (TAM) in Northern Victoria Land                       
              (NVL), Antarctica, using apatite fission track analysis.                       
              The project will attempt to confirm that a mid-Cretaceous                      
              uplift event is recorded in the Admiralty Mountains, that                      
              most of the uplift in NVL was initiated in the early                           
              Cenozoic and whether a later period of uplift, early                           
              Paleogene, can be delineated in the south east coastal                         
              region where some 10km of uplift is estimated.  Results will                   
              place the post-Jurassic tectonic evolution of NVL in context                   
              with the break-up of Australia and Antarctica and the                          
              formation of extensional features within the Ross Embayment.                   
              The sampling strategy is to take vertical profiles from                        
              granite plutons in the Admiralty Mountains and on the inland                   
              edge of the south east coastal region, as well as a                            
              horizontal transect.  Apatite will be separated from                           
              returned samples and processed for counting by the external                    
              detector method in the Fission Track Dating Laboratory at                      
              Arizona State University.  Track-length studies also form an                   
              integral part of the analysis.
