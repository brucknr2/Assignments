Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The goals of the proposed research are:  1) to determine the roles             
              of microfilaments and microtubules in movements of the ooplasm in              
              the medaka egg, 2) to determine the role of cytoplasmic calcium                
              pulses, gradients, and waves in movements of the ooplasm of the                
              medaka egg, and 3) to determine the relationship between the                   
              mechanical events of cytokinesis and microfilaments, calcium                   
              pulses, gradients and waves in the blastodisc during the first two             
              cleavages of the medaka egg.  Ooplasmic movements and cytokinesis              
              will be studied with time-lapse video microscopy, using phase                  
              contrast, Nomarski DIC, and epifluorescence optics where                       
              appropriate.  The role of cytoskeletal systems will be studied by              
              1) applying or microinjecting drugs that disrupt these systems, and            
              2) localizing microfilaments and microtubules with fluorescent                 
              phalloidins and by indirect immunofluorescence, respectively.  The             
              role of calcium will be studied by 1) looking for calcium pulses,              
              gradients, and waves with the calcium-sensitive photoprotein,                  
              Aequorin, and 2) injecting calcium buffers into the cytoplasm of               
              the egg.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              Using the fish egg as a model, these studies should provide new                
              insights into the physiological bases of two fundamental activities            
              of the cytoplasm of the fertilized egg:  its structural                        
              rearrangement and its division into daughter cells.  This research             
              will also provide the opportunity for undergraduates to participate            
              in an active research program using state of the art techniques of             
              light microscopy.
