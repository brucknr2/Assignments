Abstract    :
                   This project will support planning an activity-based                      
              statistics course for undergraduates that draws from recent                    
              experiences at the secondary level and in industry, where                      
              statistics has been made relevant by focusing on the analysis of               
              data of interest to the participants.  A laboratory-type course                
              will be planned that emphasizes modern data analysis and                       
              graphical techniques, student projects, case studies, technology,              
              and innovative teaching practices that treat statistics as a                   
              laboratory science.  It is expected that the project will provide              
              model data analysis lessons, resource reviews, and a network of                
              contributors and potential users so that a laboratory-type course              
              in statistics can actually be written and implemented.  Through                
              its advisory committee, this planning project will be connected                
              to other major efforts designed to improve the teaching of                     
              statistics across the country.
