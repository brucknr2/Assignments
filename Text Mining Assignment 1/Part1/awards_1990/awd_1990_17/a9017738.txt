Abstract    :
                   This is an SGER grant to search for particles which might                 
              explain the existence of matter we believe exists from the                     
              motion of galaxies but which heretofore has been invisible to                  
              any detection scheme.  Such matter is known as "dark matter".                  
              DeRujula, Glashow, et al have hypothesized the existence of                    
              dark matter in the form of X-, a stable, singly-charged                        
              particle with mass . 1015V, velocity . 10-3c, and flux . 1cm-                 
              2-sec.  In order to begin an exploratory search for the                        
              hypothesized X-p cosmic rays, investigators at the University                  
              of Arizona will place a mountain altitude three-counter cosmic                 
              ray telescope into full operation during the term of this                      
              grant.  They will search for a reaction cycle:  X-pX-d,X-                     
              d+12C13C+p+X-,X-X-p, all within the liquid scintillator of                   
              the counters of the detector.  Each 12C(d,p)13C reaction will                  
              cause a small (relative to charged particles, E  1eV)                        
              scintillation in the detector.  They will use coincidence                      
              and anticoincidence techniques to veto large charged-particle                  
              pulses and photomultiplier tube noise pulses in our telescope's                
              counters.  These techniques will allow them to look for a                      
              series of small scintillations within each counter, which might                
              be a signature of a slow massive particle moving through the                   
              apparatus, catalyzing nuclear reactions.  At the end of the                    
              term of this grant, they should be able to decide which                        
              directions to pursue, such as deuterium-enriched counters, more                
              counters, more electronics, or long data runs.
