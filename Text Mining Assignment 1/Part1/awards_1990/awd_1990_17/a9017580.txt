Abstract    :
              This award in the Chemistry Division supports Dr. Andrew F.                    
              Montana, Dr. Carl F. Prenzlow, and Dr. Patrick A. Wegner of the                
              Department of Chemistry of California State University at                      
              Fullerton to carry out a curriculum development project.  These                
              workers will develop Macintosh II software for use in                          
              introductory chemistry courses.  Graphics and animational                      
              methods will allow "dynamical visualization" of reaction                       
              mechanisms, gas behavior, photochemical reactions and other                    
              processes.  Development of three dimensional display of atomic,                
              hybridized, and molecular orbitals is also planned, along with                 
              interactive components on basic concepts.                                      
                                                                                             
              This supplementary material will provide an alternative to                     
              theoretical and mathematical explanations of phenomena and thus                
              be of assistance to beginning students.  Approximately 600                     
              students per year will use the software, which will also be                    
              made available with supporting documentation to other                          
              institutions.
