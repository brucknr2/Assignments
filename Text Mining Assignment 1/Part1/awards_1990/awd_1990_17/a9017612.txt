Abstract    :
                   Radar techniques provide important means for investigating                
              the upper atmosphere. As the size, power, and sophistication of                
              atmospheric radars has grown, so has our understanding of                      
              detailed atmospheric behavior. Global radar coverage has led to                
              better understanding of the upper atmosphere on a global scale.                
              Relatively recently the Japanese have begun operation of an                    
              advanced radar, and have developed some projects in collaboration              
              with the international scientific community. This program seeks                
              to continue the collaboration between the principle investigator               
              and Japanese scientists to pursue upper atmosphere research using              
              the MU (Middle and Upper atmosphere) radar operated by  the                    
              Radio Atmospheric Center of Kyoto University. The research will                
              explore local ionospheric temperature and neutral temperature and              
              density behavior, and latitudinal variations through coordinated               
              use of the MU radar and a string of ionosondes at approximately                
              the same longitude. Research at the MU radar will be conducted by              
              the principle investigator during summers, and work during the                 
              academic year will concentrate on data analysis and integration                
              of results with results of other upper-atmosphere instruments                  
              (optical and radar) from around the world.
