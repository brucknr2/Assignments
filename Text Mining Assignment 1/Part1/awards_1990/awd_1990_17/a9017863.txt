Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Plants that are exposed to gradually increasing water stress over              
              a long period of time become "drought hardened."  In this state,               
              they can survive drier conditions than plants that are shocked                 
              suddenly by drought after having an abundance of water.  In this               
              project, we are testing the two-part hypothesis that: (1)                      
              chloroplasts must maintain an optimum size in order to exhibit                 
              efficient photosynthesis, and (2) that drought hardening is a                  
              process whereby plants synthesize substances that prevent their                
              chloroplasts from shrinking as they dry.  If it is true, the                   
              hypothesis would explain at least one aspect of drought                        
              hardening.//
