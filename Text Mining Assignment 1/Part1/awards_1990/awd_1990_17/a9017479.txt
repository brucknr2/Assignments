Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              An investigation of the structure  and properties of calcium                   
              aluminate glasses and glass films prepared by unconventional                   
              methods is proposed. Calcium aluminate glasses are of scientific               
              interest because of the changes of their structural characteristics            
              as a function of calcium concentration. Therefore, it is proposed              
              to study the feasibility of preparing a wide compositional range of            
              calcium aluminate glasses by sol-gel and sputtering processes and              
              to asses the behavior and properties of these materials as a                   
              function of various processing steps. Due to their mid-infrared                
              transparency calcium aluminates have an important technological                
              potential as low loss optical fiber materials.
