Abstract    :
                   The PI will investigate ductile deformation of polymineralic              
              rocks with emphasis on evaluating inter and intragrain                         
              heterogeneities.  Among polycrystal plasticity theories used to                
              model deformation, the viscoplastic self-consistent theory is                  
              particularly attractive for anisotropic rocks.  As a model system              
              the PI plans to investigate first quartz in quartzo feldspathic                
              rocks and use the development of preferred orientation as an                   
              indicative parameter in comparisons of models with experiments                 
              and naturally deformed rocks.
