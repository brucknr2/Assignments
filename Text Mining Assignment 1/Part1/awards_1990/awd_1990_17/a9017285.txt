Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Technical Narrative:                                                           
                                                                                             
              This U.S.-Nigeria collaborative research project involving                     
              Indiana University and the University of Ibadan, Ibadan, Nigeria               
              is in the area of geochemical and stable isotopic studies of mid-              
              Cretaceous black shales. Project funding will allow a highly                   
              qualified researcher from Nigeria to spend an extended period of               
              time in the laboratory of Dr. Lisa M. Pratt at Indiana                         
              University.  The collaborative research will investigate mid-                  
              Cretaceous black shales from the Benue trough in southeastern                  
              Nigeria.  One of the projected outcomes of the study will be a                 
              strategic framework for the Nigerian black shales that can be                  
              correlated with standard North American and European stages.                   
                                                                                             
              This project in geochemistry fulfills the program objective of                 
              advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the              
              United States and Nigeria to combine complementary talents and                 
              pool research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and                 
              competence.
