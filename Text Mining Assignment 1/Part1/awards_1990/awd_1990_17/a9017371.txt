Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  It is proposed to measure and analyze the electgrical                     
              conductivity and Hall effect in high-temperature superconducting               
              compounds.  The work will begin with studies of YBa2Cu3O7-s untwinned          
              single crystals as a function of Temperature, magnetic field and               
              the Oxygen-Content parameter s, and will then be extended to other             
              compounds as high-quality samples become available.                            
                   These measurements will test the adequacy of current theory to            
              explain the behavior of high-temperature superconductors (HTSCs)               
              and should help one to develop a better theory of HTSC.
