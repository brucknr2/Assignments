Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is concerned with the photoregulation of carbon-                  
              fixation enzymes in the photosynthetic process; two key enzymes--              
              one in the cytoplasm, the other in the chloroplast--are subject to             
              post-translational modification by reversible phosphorylation(s),              
              and are the focus of the research planned.  Detailed biochemical               
              examination of in vivo phosphorylation events is one part of the               
              project, while a second part will be focused on an apparent light-             
              modulated protein turnover.  Regulation of photosynthetic events               
              will be understood much better when the results of these studies               
              are available, for they will provide enlarged insights into both               
              chloroplastic and cytoplasmic, reversible phosphorylation processes            
              in plants.                                                                     
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
              This three year, renewal project is focused on analysis of the                 
              reversible light activation of two key enzymes involved in C-4                 
              photosynthesis in plants.  The results can be expected to provide              
              important details of this regulation as it is effected by                      
              reversible phosphorylation in both the cytoplasm and chloroplasts              
              of plants.   //
