Abstract    :
                   In the upper ocean mixing processes occur which tend to                   
              homogenize properties and disperse organisms throughout the mixed              
              layer.  However, organized motions in the vertical plane may be                
              established due to Langmuir circulations.  When these occur, they              
              may suspend particles and biological species.  This study is a                 
              theoretical investigation of the process of suspension of                      
              material by organized circulation.  The investigators will                     
              utilize concepts from chaotic theory to calculate the statistics               
              of residence time as functions of depth, the expected spatial                  
              distributions, and the levels of concentration of these suspended              
              materials.
