Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will study the distribution of certain              
              platinum group elements (iridium and palladium) between sulfide                
              and silicate melts and dependencies of this distribution on                    
              sulfur fugacity, oxygen fugacity, and temperature. Equilibration               
              experiments will be carried out at high pressure (7-10 kilobars)               
              in piston cylinder apparatus, as well as at lower pressures in a               
              vertical muffle tube furnace. Results will provide basic data,                 
              currently unavailable, to understand and interpret platinum group              
              element geochemistry, as well as to address more general problems              
              such as the evolution of certain kinds of igneous rocks.
