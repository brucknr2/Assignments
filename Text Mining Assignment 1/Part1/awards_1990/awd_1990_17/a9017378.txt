Abstract    :
              The published record indicates that a multiplicity of fluids is                
              involved in mantle processes leading to the formation of                       
              kimberlites and diamonds.  It is the purpose of the proposed work              
              to contribute to the clarification of the emerging very complex                
              picture of diamond growth and mantle metasomatism.  In particular              
              the PI will attempt to trace the distribution and origin of                    
              highly 13C depleted mantle carbon further, following the leeds                 
              developed by the work carried out so far.                                      
              A major new thrust of the proposed work will be the examination                
              of the oxygen isotope record of silicate in inclusions in                      
              diamonds and the carbon isotopic composition of the host.  The                 
              studies will be carried out on suites of samples for which an                  
              asthenospheric origin can be postulated as well as on diamonds                 
              which were formed at shallower levels.  The results of the work                
              will provide an important constraint for hypotheses proposing                  
              subduction related origins of diamonds which were formed at 400                
              to 500 km depth.                                                               
              It is also planned to delineate further the various mantle carbon              
              reservoirs that are presently under discussion, and to establish               
              the joint 813C and 818O record left by mantle metasomatic events.
