Abstract    :
                   This award supports research involving a study of the                     
              applicability of Artificial Neural Networks to the problem of                  
              determination and compensation of positioning errors in machine                
              tools and coordinate measuring machines.  Research issues which                
              will be explored are:  (1) Prediction and compensation of                      
              geometrically induced errors using a neural network to map                     
              workspace positions into tool point error vectors with training                
              data obtained from machine measurement of a precision physical                 
              artifact. (2) Prediction and compensation of thermally induced                 
              errors using a small number of strategically located temperature               
              probes as additional input to an expanded neural net, and                      
              performing the artifact measurement for differing thermal states               
              of the machine. (3) Generation of design rules for the design of               
              the physical artifact to insure optimal performance of the neural              
              net error compensation technique. (4) Investigation of the                     
              possibility of using the results of dimensional inspection of                  
              manufactured parts to update the training set for the neural                   
              network; thus closing the loop between process output quality and              
              process input variables, resulting in continuous process                       
              improvement in an automated factory environment. (5)                           
              Investigation into the necessary architectural features and                    
              computational capabilities of a hybrid neural net machine tool                 
              controller.
