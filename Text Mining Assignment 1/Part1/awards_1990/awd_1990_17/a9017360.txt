Abstract    :
              It is proposed to develop a new reactor, the so-called two-                    
              impinging-jets crystallizer.  By impinging two streams in                      
              countercurrent in a small volume, a high level of mixing is                    
              achievable.  The proposed reactor can be used to yield                         
              micrometer size crystals.  Oscillatory motion of fluid                         
              particles near the jet interaction zone should insure good                     
              mixing and a controlled residence time.  An experimental study                 
              will be undertaken to establish the feasibility and                            
              performance of this reactor.  The turbulent mixing at the                      
              impinging zone will be hydrodynamically simulated by using a                   
              continuum approach.  The proposed reactor has potential to                     
              improve the process of crystal growth for producing silica,                    
              various metal alkoxides sols, pharmaceutical and photographic                  
              materials.
