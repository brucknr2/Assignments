Abstract    :
                   This work will continue a program of studies in                           
              theoretical nuclear physics on problems of three-body forces in                
              nuclei, nuclear charge asymmetry, hypernuclei and quark cluster                
              models.  A three body cluster model will be applied to study                   
              Lithium-six.
