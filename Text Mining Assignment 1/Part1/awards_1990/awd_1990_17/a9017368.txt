Abstract    :
              This award is for a two-year pilot study of an innovative                      
              instrumental technique to obtain precise radial velocities of                  
              stars.  The technique is to insert a recently constructed container            
              filled with iodine gas in beam of a coude spectrometer at McDonald             
              Observatory.  This gas will absorb starlight at well known                     
              wavelengths, thereby providing a set of calibration lines                      
              interspersed with the stellar lines in the spectrum.  With this                
              innovation, the PI expects to obtain radial velocities to an                   
              accuracy of +-5 m/sec (roughly 8 mph).  He will then obtain a time             
              series of spectra for several bright red giant stars and search for            
              pulsations in them.   The PI has already used a related                        
              instrumental technique to verfify the existence of a 1.8-day period            
              in the red giant Arcturus.  If this pulsation in Arcturus is                   
              typical of other red giants, then a new class of variable stars                
              will have been discovered.  The data will be used for a variety of             
              other astrophysical purposes, including the study of convective                
              circulation cells and magnetic "activity" on these stars surfaces.             
              Either pulsations, magnetic activity, or both of these phenomena,              
              could be responsible for heating the outer atmospheres                         
              ("chromospheres") of red giants.  Chromospheres, in turn, are                  
              thought to cause a mass loss, which can significantly affect the               
              subsequent history of the star's evolution.
