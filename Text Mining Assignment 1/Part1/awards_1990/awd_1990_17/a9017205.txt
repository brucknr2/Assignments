Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will study fluid infiltration patterns              
              in rocks of the Rio Mora uplift of New Mexico, utilizing field,                
              petrologic and isotopic techniques. Results will add significant-              
              ly to understanding of the permeabilities of metamorphic rocks,                
              the mechanisms that generate such permeability, the 3-dimensional              
              geometry of fluid infiltration, and in general to the ways in which            
              fluids interact with rocks of the Earth's crust during                         
              metamorphism.
