Abstract    :
                   Multiphoton processes in atoms irradiated by strong laser                 
              fields are studied.  The research concentrates on angular                      
              distributions for H atoms, various aspects of two color                        
              ionization of H, and H-, extensions of the dc rate theory to                   
              alternating fields, and an improved method for solving the                     
              time-dependent Schroedinger equation in momentum space.
