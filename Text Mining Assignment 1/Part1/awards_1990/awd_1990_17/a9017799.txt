Abstract    :
              SoAR:  AI in Electric Power Systems:  A Survey of the Japanese                 
              Industry                                                                       
                                                                                             
                 This State-of-the-Art survey award will send Professor Saifur               
              Rahman, of the Energy System Research Laboratory of Virginia                   
              Polytechnic Institute and State University, to Japan to survey                 
              applications of artificial intelligence (AI) to electric power                 
              systems.  Professor Rahman has been commissioned by the Electric               
              Power Research Institute (EPRI) to survey the current level and                
              future potential of use of expert systems at U.S. electric                     
              utilities.  This survey will add a comparison of the experience                
              of Japanese researchers, who are known to have made significant                
              advances in applying expert systems and other AI technology to                 
              power systems, but who have not published widely in the English-               
              language literature.
