Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will experimentally study the melting               
              behavior of silicate-carbonate-carbon dioxide-water systems.  The              
              project will attempt to trace the reduced volatile components and              
              their metasomatic and magmatic effects from the deep mantle to                 
              their consolidation in, or exsolution from, near-surface magmas.               
              Specifically, the results will have application to the origin of               
              Kimberlites and carbonatites.  More generally, the results will                
              help geologists understand important processes in earth evolution              
              for environments ranging from very deep to near-surface.
