Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award is for renewed support for the                                      
              National Research Council's Committee on                                       
              Natural Disasters (CND) which was established                                  
              to maintain readiness for conducting                                           
              postdisaster reconnaissance studies.  Such                                     
              studies include documenting perishable                                         
              information valuable to researchers,                                           
              planners, designers, practitioners, and                                        
              building officials, as well as to emergency                                    
              preparedness officials, for their use in                                       
              mitigating future natural disasters.  The                                      
              committee also conducts separate studies,                                      
              meetings, seminars, or symposia in the                                         
              interests of (a) implementing recommendations                                  
              of the quick-response teams, and (b)                                           
              improving our ability to cope with future                                      
              natural disasters.  Long-term issues                                           
              regarding non-earthquake types of natural                                      
              disasters and multiple-hazards issues also                                     
              are routinely a part of the committee's                                        
              agenda.
