Abstract    :
                   This award provides two-thirds of the funding for acquiring               
              a computerized control and analysis system for specialized                     
              microscopy of rock deformation experiments. The equipment is to be             
              installed and used in the Department of Geological Sciences at the             
              State University of New York in Albany. The SUNY system is                     
              committed to providing the remaining one-third funding for the                 
              acquisition of the equipment.                                                  
                   Rocks and minerals subjected to mechanical stress and chemical            
              changes deform very slowly over geologically significant periods               
              of time. Much insight on the processes of recrystallization,                   
              diffusive transfer of material, phase transformations and other                
              processes that influence the mechanical-chemical behavior and the              
              microstructure of deformed rocks can be harvested from studying,               
              under the microscope, the deformation of synthetic analogs during              
              much shorter time scales. The acquisition of this equipment will               
              allow one of the leading research groups performing this type of               
              research to automate the control, recording, and analysis of the               
              microstructural evolution of rock deformation.
