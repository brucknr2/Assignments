Abstract    :
                   Magnetic petrology has as its goal the integration of                     
              magnetic property studies with petrologic studies for the purpose              
              of understand the development and modification of magnetization                
              in rocks.  The principal investigator will initiate a long-term                
              study of the magnetic petrology of the lower continental crust.                
              As the initial phase of this program, this proposal focuses on                 
              crustal xenoliths from convergent arc margins and continental                  
              rift zones.  Mafic xenoliths from volcanic centers in the (1)                  
              Aleutian arc, (2) Japan, (3) Rio Grande Rift and (4) Antarctica                
              will be analyzed by petrographic-microprobe methods in addition                
              to standard rock magnetization techniques.  The results are                    
              expected to provide constraints on candidate source materials for              
              the long-wavelength magnetic anomalies revealed by Magsat and                  
              regional aeromagnetic surveys.  They should also provide basic                 
              information on petrologic controls responsible for the                         
              magnetization behavior of lower crustal rocks.
