Abstract    :
                   The goal of this project is to understand the effects of                  
              high pressure on grain-growth in fine-grained olivine and B-phase              
              aggregates and on dislocation recovery in olivine by the static                
              annealing at high temperatures using the multiple anvil high                   
              pressure apparatus.  This study will yield the first data set on               
              the kinetics of grain-growth and dislocation recovery at very                  
              high pressure under well-controlled chemical environments.  The                
              results have important applications in a wide range of geological              
              problems, including the evaluation of annealing effects in                     
              paleopiezometers, the evaluation of the effects of transformation              
              superplasticity, and the creep mechanisms and the mechanisms of                
              dynamic recrystallization in these minerals.
