Abstract    :
              Support is requested for the 34th annual meeting of the Wind                   
              River Conference on Genetic Exchange, to be held at the Wind                   
              River Ranch, Estes Park, Colorado, June 6-10 1990.  This                       
              conference is primarily concerned with the biology and molecular               
              biology of genetic exchange systems in a variety of procaryotic                
              and eucaryotic systems, and is the major annually occurring                    
              meeting devoted to this subject area internationally.  One                     
              significant feature of these meetings is their accessibility to                
              graduate students and post-doctoral students, whose travel funds               
              frequently are limited.  Specifically to address this problem,                 
              funds are provided to support travel and scholarships to                       
              facilitate the attendance of graduate students and post-doctoral               
              students working in various areas of genetic exchange and                      
              related subject areas.
