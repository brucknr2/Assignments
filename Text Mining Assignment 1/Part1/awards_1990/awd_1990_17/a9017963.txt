Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The composition of cuticular wax of plants is complex and                      
              incompletely known, and rather little is known of the biosynthesis             
              of this material(s).  Two of the seventeen loci known to be                    
              involved in biosynthesis of this wax in maize have been tagged with            
              transposable elements; these genes will be cloned and, using the               
              transposable element as a molecular probe, a study of the                      
              biosynthetic pathway (localization, structure, and regulation of               
              the gene products) undertaken.  Comparison of the events in maize              
              with those of Arabidopsis is planned; these studies should lead to             
              increased comprehension of the biochemical mechanisms involved in              
              the synthesis of these unique and biologically significant plant               
              lipids.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              The cuticular waxes of plants constitute the first barrier to the              
              environment and the stresses it imposes on plants, and thus these              
              waxes play an important role in plant survival.  The composition               
              of these waxes and the biosynthetic pathways by which they are                 
              formed are incompletely known. This project will make use of                   
              transposon-tagged cloned genes to examine the gene products of the             
              biosynthetic pathway and thus enlarge our understanding of it.//
