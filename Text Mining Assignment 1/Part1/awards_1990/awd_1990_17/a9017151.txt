Abstract    :
              This grant funds the development of a software tool for the                    
              statistical analysis of integrated circuit failures.  The tool will            
              be used on existing failure rate data to locate unpredicted                    
              combinations of circuit parameters that produce failure.                       
              Statistical methods are necessary because of the randomness in                 
              failure data and the very large number of parameters which interact            
              to as yet poorly understood ways.  These parameter combinations                
              yield insight on the nature of those interactions.  This insight               
              will be systematized using artificial intelligence techniques.
