Abstract    :
                   This award provides support for the acquisition and                       
              modification of components into a microdensitometer system for                 
              measuring the intensities of diffracted x-rays as recorded on x-               
              ray sensitive film. The instrument will be developed and                       
              installed in the Department of Geology and Geophysics at the                   
              University of California at Berkeley. It will be used primarily                
              in the characterization of materials subjected to ultra-high                   
              pressures during laboratory experiments intended to mimic                      
              conditions inside the Earth's deep interior.
