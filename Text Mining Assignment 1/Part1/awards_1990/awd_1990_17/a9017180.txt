Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Interlukins are important substances produced by the immune                    
              system.  These substances, first discovered in white blood                     
              cells, have been implicated in a number of basic brain                         
              functions, such as sleep, disorientation, the production of                    
              fever and coma.  This research will explore the regulation of                  
              neuronal interlukin metabolism, a problem of paramount                         
              importance in neuroscience.  Dr. Reichlin will develop separate                
              cultures of neurons and glia cells to test the effects of                      
              molecular probes, and to study the factors which influence the                 
              synthesis and secretion of neuronal interlukins in the brain.                  
              Results from this study will aid in understanding the role of                  
              interlukins in the brain.
