Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The leukocyte adhesion molecule LFA-1 plays a crucial role in all              
              forms and levels of immunity.  Leukocytes are able to turn LFA-1               
              function on or off on a minute-by-minute basis, giving them precise            
              control over their adhesions with each other and other cells.  The             
              rapid regulation of LFA-1 function is mediated by protein kinase               
              C, and does not require changes in cell surface density of LFA-1               
              or its ligand, ICAM-1.  Rather, the regulation of the avidity of               
              LFA-1 for ICAM-1 involves poorly defined configurational changes.              
              Elucidation of these configurational changes is the goal of this               
              research.  Highly plausible changes would be homotypic clustering              
              of LFA-1 to increase avidity for ICAM-1 and anchoring to the                   
              cytoskeleton.  The approach proposed is to quantitate clustering               
              by flow cytometric analysis of fluorescence resonance energy                   
              transfer, a method proven capable of estimating mean intermolecular            
              distances on cell surfaces.  The ability to quantitate clustering              
              will make it possible to explore its mechanisms, including the                 
              roles of divalent cations and cytoskeleton.  Anchoring to the                  
              cytoskeleton will be evaluated by solubility in Triton X-100.                  
                                                                                             
              Cellular adhesion plays a critical role in many developmental and              
              physiological processes, including immune function.  The molecular             
              mechanisms by which cells recognize and adhere to appropriate                  
              partners is a subject of great current interest.  The proposed                 
              research will explore an innovative approach to the study of                   
              mechanisms by which the strength of adhesion between cells is                  
              regulated.
