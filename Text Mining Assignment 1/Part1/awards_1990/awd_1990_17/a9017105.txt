Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The Principal Investigator will analyze samples from 40                   
              dredge stations occupied along the kolbeinsey, Mohns, and                      
              Knipovich ridges from 65 to 80 N. The petrology, trace element                 
              and Nd-Sr isotope ratios of these samples already have been                    
              studied. Pb isotope ratios and Th-U-Pb concentrations will be                  
              measured. The results will provide a complete date base for                    
              modelling crust and mantle processes associated with the                       
              Greenland basin, and the dynamic and thrmal influence of the                   
              Iceland and Jan Mayen plumes on the ridges.
