Abstract    :
              The project, in the general area of Analytical and Surface                     
              Chemistry, focuses on mass spectrometry.   The principal                       
              emphasis will be on ion chemistry.  The work promises to lead                  
              to new instrumental features which will advance the analytical                 
              application of mass spectrometry and also provide a better                     
              understanding of ion chemistry.                                                
                                                                                             
              The work will focus on four areas related to charge-remote                     
              fragmentation in mass spectrometry, namely energetics,                         
              mechanism, extension to new types of reactions, and                            
              identification of neutrals produced in charge-remote chemistry.                
              Ion chemistry studies will include radical cation chemistry,                   
              the study of ionization potentials of small inorganic ions, and                
              aldol-type reactions of negative ions.    Some aspects of                      
              instrumental development will be examined that relate to ion                   
              chemistry.  In particular, work will be carried out on Fourier                 
              transform mass spectrometry (FTMS) ion traps.
