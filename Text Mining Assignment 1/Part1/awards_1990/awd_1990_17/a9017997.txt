Abstract    :
              This research is concerned with soft x-ray spectroscopy studies                
              using radiation from the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS)              
              for the excitation of emission spectra.  The work involves a                   
              collaboration between the University of Tennessee, Oak Ridge                   
              National Laboratory, and National Institute of Standards and                   
              Technology scientists.  The research represents a continuation of              
              the studies of the electronic properties of solid systems such as              
              high Tc superconductors, boron compounds, rare gas solids, and                 
              impurity systems.  There will be an effort to pursue threshold                 
              excitation studies and also hybrid laser-synchrotron radiation                 
              studies.  In the third year of the program it is intended to                   
              initiate new studies at the Advanced Light Source (ALS) at Lawrence            
              Berkeley Laboratory.  The work at ALS will be extended to dilute               
              impurity systms and to threshold studies using high resolution                 
              photon excitation into localized excited states.
