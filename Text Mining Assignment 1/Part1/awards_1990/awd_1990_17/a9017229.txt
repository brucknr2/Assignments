Abstract    :
                   The genesis of Triassic plutons along the continental margin              
              arc of southern California will be studied by U-Pb zircon                      
              geochronology, trace element analysis, and by Nd, Sr, and Pb                   
              isotope analyses.  These analyses will allow the relative roles of             
              upper crustal assimilation and fractionation to be ascertained for             
              the stages of pluton evolution.  Triassic plutons have been little             
              studied until now and the data will provide much needed information            
              on the early evolution of the magmatic arc.  The results of this               
              study will have important implications for the tectonic evolution              
              of southern California and for the composition of the Proterozoic              
              lithosphere in the region.
