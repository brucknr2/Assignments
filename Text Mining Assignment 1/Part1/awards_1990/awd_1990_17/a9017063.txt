Abstract    :
              This award will support Professor William Rose of Michigan                     
              Technological University in a research collaboration with                      
              Professor Zoltan de Cserna of the Institute de Geologia of                     
              the National Autonomous University  (UNAM) of Mexico.  The                     
              objective of the research is to carry out a detailed study of                  
              the later eruptive products of Citlaltepetl volcano, in order                  
              to describe its explosivity, sequence of volcanic events and                   
              general evolution.  The work will result in a modern                           
              characterization of a large glaciated sub-tropical strato-                     
              volcano, which will facilitate important volcanic hazard                       
              evaluations.  The analysis of this information will provide                    
              important support for the second goal, the establishment of                    
              specific volcanic hazard planning for the Citlaltepetl                         
              region.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              Citlaltepetl is the highest peak in Mexico (5675m) and the                     
              third highest peak in North America.  It is the easternmost                    
              volcano of the Transmexican Volcanic Belt, located on an                       
              important normal fault zone that marks the central plateau                     
              from the Mexican Gulf coastal plains.  Citlaltepetl  volcano                   
              has been proposed for volcanological research because of the                   
              perceived potential volcanic hazards for the surrounding                       
              areas and because there is only a limited amount of geological                 
              or volcanological information available at present.  Such a                    
              volcano is an important target for detailed study because                      
              high, glaciated tropical volcanoes have rarely been thoroughly                 
              described and, as the experience at Nevado de Ruiz volcano                     
              (colombia) (Naranjo et al., 1986) in 1985 shows, are                           
              inadequately understood and particularly dangerous.
