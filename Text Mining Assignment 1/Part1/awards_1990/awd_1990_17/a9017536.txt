Abstract    :
                   Continent-continent collisions commonly produce high                      
              topography with rapid uplift rates and accompanying high erosion               
              rates, however these important tectonic parameters are difficult               
              to quantify.  This project will utilize fission-track technology               
              to constrain uplift rates in the still-active Northwestern                     
              Himalaya.  Measurement of the erosion and uplift rates prevalent               
              during orogeny will provide constraints for metamorphic tectonic,              
              and geodynamic models of continent-continent collisions.
