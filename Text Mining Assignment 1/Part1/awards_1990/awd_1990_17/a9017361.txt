Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Equilibrium phases of strongly interacting Fermi systems will be               
              investigated by developing series expansions for static and dynamic            
              properties of model Hamiltonians.  These will include zero                     
              temperature expansions around simple exactly soluble Hamiltonians,             
              as well as high temperature expansions.  The thermodynamic                     
              functions studied will include the free energy, the relevant order             
              parameters and their susceptibilities, and some characteristic                 
              Fermi liquid quantities such as the momentum distribution function.            
              In addition, the frequency moments of experimentally observable                
              dynamical quantities such as spin-lattice relaxation rates, the                
              light scattering spectra and the optical conductivity will also be             
              calculated.  The results of this work should provide us with novel             
              insight into several condensed matter phenomena including the                  
              existence and interplay of magnetic and superconducting order,                 
              metal insulator transitions, and the validity of the Fermi liquid              
              description for the low energy excitations in strongly correlated              
              systems.
