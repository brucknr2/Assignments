Abstract    :
                   Recently, experiments have been performed which demonstrate               
              that interference between alternative excitation pathways in the               
              laser excitation of atoms and molecules can be observed and                    
              controlled using non-linear conversion techniques.  In order to                
              obtain a better understanding of these phenomena, it is proposed               
              to extend the work on measuring phase differences to (a) the                   
              effect of interfering processes on photo-electron angular                      
              distributions, (b) phase differences between the fundamental and               
              third harmonic in third harmonic generations, (c) two-photon                   
              resonant cases and (d) control of relative production rates of                 
              excited states in atomic barium.
