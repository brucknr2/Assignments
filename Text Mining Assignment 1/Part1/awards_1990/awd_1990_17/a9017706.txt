Abstract    :
              With this grant in the Theoretical and Computational Program of                
              the Chemistry Division, Professor Scuseria will develop new                    
              algorithms for the application  of coupled-cluster perturbation                
              theory to the study of molecular electronic structure. This                    
              theory will be instrumental in understanding chemical bonding                  
              in transition metal dimers, hydrides and the C-H bond of                       
              acetylene.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              Four research projects will be carried out. (1) The formulation                
              and implementation of an analytical energy gradient capacity                   
              within the open shell coupled-cluster method. (2) The                          
              implementation  of a full coupled-cluster method that includes                 
              all single, double, triple and quadruple excitations. (3) A                    
              solution of the coupled-cluster equations that attempts to                     
              transfer the effect of triple excitations directly onto the                    
              single and double excitation amplitudes. (4) A formulation of                  
              the coupled-cluster theory in terms of the                                     
              Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov reference state as an alternate to the                 
              conventional multi-reference approach.
