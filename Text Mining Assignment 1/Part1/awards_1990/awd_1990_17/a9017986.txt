Abstract    :
              This is a request for partial support for a conference                         
              entitled "Future Directions for Lasers in Medicine and                         
              Surgery II".  The conference is to be held on February 24 -                    
              March 1, 1991 in Palm Coast, FL.  The conference, the second                   
              in a series, will bring together engineers, scientists and                     
              physicians to assess progress made on the application of                       
              lasers to medicine.  This conference should aid in                             
              developing future avenues of research in an important and                      
              growing area of research.
