Abstract    :
              This award will support collaboration between Professor                        
              Richard Pratt of the University of Pittsburgh and Professors                   
              Solange de Barros and Odair Goncalves of the Federal University                
              of Rio de Janeiro, in cooperation with a physics group at the                  
              Federal University of Parana in Curitiba, Brazil.  The aim of                  
              the research is to conduct experimental and theoretical                        
              investigations into the elastic scattering of gamma rays and                   
              X-rays from atoms, based on complementary programs at the                      
              three above universities.                                                      
                                                                                             
              The main focus will be on anomalous scattering (elastic                        
              scattering of photons with energies near atomic absorption                     
              edges).  Understanding the photon scattering process is                        
              important in improving the technology base and the basic                       
              understanding of atomic and solid-state physics.  The                          
              project will attempt to identify suitable choices for a                        
              critical comparison of theory and experiment.  The researchers                 
              will study the effects of different atomic potentials and use                  
              experimental information to understand the limits of certainty                 
              in predictions near atomic edges.  Their experimental work                     
              will test the validity of these predictions.  The theoretical                  
              research will be conducted at the University of Pittsburgh.                    
              The experimental work will be performed at the Federal University of Rio       
              de Janeiro and the Federal University of Parana.
