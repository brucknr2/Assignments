Abstract    :
                   The International Geological Correlation Program is a                     
              multidisciplinary scientific program established in its present                
              form in 1973, sponsored jointly by the International Union of                  
              Geological Sciences (IUGS) and by the United Nations Educational,              
              Scientific, and Cultural Organization Unesco).  The principal goal             
              of IGCP is to promote international cooperation in research on                 
              global geologic problems, with emphasis on the nature and sequence             
              of major geologic events, geologic hazards, and energy and mineral             
              resources.  Program work is carried out through 59 individual                  
              research projects, 20 of which have U.S. working groups.                       
                   The United States has played a prominent role in IGCP since               
              its establishment.  U.S. geoscientist helped design the Program and            
              are members of the IGCP Board and Scientific Advisory Committee.               
              The USNC/IGCP provides coordination and oversight of U.S. IGCP                 
              activities.  Support for this role is provided by the U.S.                     
              Geological Survey (USGS) in the amount of $30,000 annually for                 
              travel expenses for the Committee and administrative support costs             
              within the USGS.  NSF Funds underwrite domestic meetings of U.S.               
              project working groups, travel by U.S. representatives to project              
              conferences and field excursions abroad, and general clerical and              
              technical assistance to the working group chairman.
