Abstract    :
              This project is to extend studies of S isotope systematics to                  
              other continental hydrothermal systems, making use of new                      
              drillcores and fluid samples from active geothermal systems as                 
              well as fossil epithermal gold deposits.  The PI will examine the              
              general systematics of sulfur isotopic zoning of sulfide minerals              
              in response to boiling and other forms of fluid immiscibility in               
              ore-forming environments.  The generality of the proposed                      
              parallel effects on precious metals deposition will also be                    
              tested at several localaties.  In addition to the Valles Caldera,              
              the Geysers and Coso geothermal fields in California offer two                 
              active settings where boiling and precious metals deposition                   
              occur.  Additionally, the McLaughlin and Cactus Queen gold                     
              deposits in California offer two fossil epithermal systems where               
              similar systematics may have existed during ore genesis.
