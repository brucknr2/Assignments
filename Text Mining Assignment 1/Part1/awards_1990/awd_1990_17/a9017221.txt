Abstract    :
              During  the past few years, there has been  increasing interest in             
              the development of processing techniques based on the high-order               
              statistics of the signals. These techniques take into account, in              
              a systematic manner, the non-Gaussian aspects of the signals.                  
              Digital communication signals represent a particularly important               
              class of non-Gaussian signals for which high-order processing                  
              techniques appear to be well suited. Adaptive channel equalizers               
              are an indispensable part of modern digital communication systems              
              which attempt to correct the distorting effect of the channel to               
              allow higher transmission rates. The objective of the proposed                 
              research is the development and analysis of high-order processing              
              techniques, focusing on their applications to communications                   
              processing. As a particularly promising application of these                   
              techniques, this proposal presents a novel approach to channel                 
              equalization, based on recent theoretical results on parameter                 
              estimation based on high-order statistics developed by the                     
              principal investigator. The proposal will also investigate other               
              applications of high-order statistics to communications signal                 
              processing including signal analysis, signal detection, and signal             
              design.
