Abstract    :
                This research is a continuation of a project to determine the                
              structure of the earth's inner core.  Seismic constraints on                   
              inner-core properties include the velocity, density; and Q                     
              structure, and the recent suggestions of heterogeneity and/or                  
              anisotropy.  Some of these properties are not well determined and              
              there have been discrepancies between models obtained from body                
              wave studies and those from normal modes.  These issues will be                
              addressed by systematically examining a variety of data sets                   
              which constrain inner-core structure, including ISC travel times,              
              GDSN waveforms, and free oscillation spectra.  The aim is to find              
              the simplest inner-core models consistent with the data, and                   
              estimate the resolution associated with these models.
