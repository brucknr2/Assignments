Abstract    :
              Observations suggest that deep overpressured sediments in the                  
              U.S. Gulf Coast Sedimentary Basin are expelling porewaters                     
              vertically near the flanks of some salt domes.  The project will               
              numerically model flow fields, brine plumes and thermal anomalies              
              that may result around generic salt domes by this process.  The                
              numerical modeling will incorporate the effect of dewatering a                 
              thick overpressured sedimentary section deeper than 3 to 4 km,                 
              with fluid expulsion preferentially upward near the flanks of the              
              domes.  The modeling will also incorporate the effect of                       
              instabilities induced by porewater density gradients due to                    
              salinity and temperature variations.  In parallel, subsurface                  
              salinities, temperatures and pressures will be mapped in vertical              
              cross-sections across eight salt domes in the U.S. Gulf Coast,                 
              using borehole logs to determine whether basin dewatering is                   
              manifested by brine plumes and thermal anomalies.  The proposed                
              work may help explain the origin of 1)heavy metal sulfide                      
              deposits and diagenetic minerals precipitated above or on the                  
              flanks of salt domes, at temperatures tens of degrees above that               
              of host sediments, and 2)perched brine plumes above the salt                   
              domes, gravitationally unstable by virtue of their high density.               
              The work proposed here may also shed some light on mechanisms for              
              hydrocarbon migration because hydrocarbons often occur on the                  
              flanks of salt domes above overpressed sediments.
