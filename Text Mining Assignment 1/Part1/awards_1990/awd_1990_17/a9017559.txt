Abstract    :
                   The proposed research plans to provide a fundamental                      
              understanding of the behavior of light secondary attachments and               
              equipment in large space structures under a variety of microgravity            
              loading conditions. One main objective is to develop passive and               
              active vibration control strategy for sensitive on-board equipment.            
              Responses of light secondary systems and equipment aboard large                
              flexible space structures and spacecrafts with or without vibration            
              control devices will be analyzed. These systems and equipment will             
              be subjected to acoustics, on-board moving (rotating)                          
              instrumentation, lift-off, micrometeroid impacts and maneuvering               
              and deployment loadings. Deterministic and probabilistic                       
              techniques, as well as, digital simulations will be used in these              
              analyses. The nature of tuning of secondary systems to space                   
              structures with passive or active vibration control devices will               
              be critically examined. Particular attention will be given to                  
              performance analyses of frictional dampers for passive vibration               
              control of equipment aboard space structures.
