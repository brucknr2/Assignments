Abstract    :
                   Most of the heat energy that drives and shapes atmospheric                
              circulation patterns comes from the sun via the underlying                     
              surface of the atmosphere. Thermal contrasts on the surface are                
              generated, e.g., by continent-ocean and pole-equator differences               
              on the large scale. The Tibetan Plateau in the summer-time can                 
              function as an "elevated hot-plate", reinforcing the thermal                   
              contrast provided by the massive Eurasian continent and its                    
              surrounding oceans. It is conceivable that this reinforcement                  
              explains the occurence of the much more pronounced seasonal                    
              reversal of circulation over South Asia than over other regions.               
              Bannon proposes to use a set of developing theoretical tools to                
              explore this possibility. His proposed parallel study will use                 
              variations of these tools to analyze the role of  the underlying               
              surface in the reinforcement or elimination of strong temperature              
              contrasts already present in its overlying (traveling or                       
              stationary) air masses. A successful analysis of this process                  
              will help reduce the frequency of a particularly vexing set of                 
              weather forecasting errors, in which frontal passages occur when               
              they were forecasted, but their associated precipitation                       
              patterns, wind conditions, and temperature changes are either                  
              much weaker or stronger than forecast.                                         
                   Bannon's previous work has both built and applied the tools               
              to be used in problems of this type.
