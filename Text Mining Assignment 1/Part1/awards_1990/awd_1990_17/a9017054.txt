Abstract    :
              This grant funds the development of electrical models of the                   
              interconnections in Multichip Modules (MCMs) that are useful at                
              Gigahertz frequencies.  At these frequencies the interconnections              
              have a significant if not dominant effect.  MCMs are the next                  
              generation packaging technique.  Better MCM models are needed to               
              exploit the opportunities that MCMs offer for essential                        
              enhancements in the performance of both analog and digital                     
              electronics.  The models will be obtained from experimental,                   
              analytical, and simulation studies.  The outcome will be tables                
              with routines for interpolation that can be imbedded in MCM design             
              rules and invoked by separate MCM CAD tools.
