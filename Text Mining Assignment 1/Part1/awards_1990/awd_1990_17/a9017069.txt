Abstract    :
              The distribution of halogens in large layered intrusions is of                 
              interest because halogen variations provide information on the                 
              degassing history of these intrusions.  Halogen distributions                  
              also provide evidence for understanding any possible role by                   
              volatile-rich fluids in the transport of economically important                
              trace metals such as the platinum group elements.  This project                
              is to look at halogens in hydrous phases to understand the role                
              of volatile-rich fluids in the transport of economically                       
              important trace metals such as platinum-group elements.  The                   
              hydrous minerals will be analyzed by electron probe, and whole                 
              rock analysis will be carried out by ICP.  Results from this                   
              study should be applicable to other layered intrusions such as                 
              the Stillwater and the Bushveld.
