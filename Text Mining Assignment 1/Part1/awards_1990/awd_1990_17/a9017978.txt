Abstract    :
              An international conference on "The Thermodynamic Basis of                     
              Protein Structure and Function" will be held on October 4-7,                   
              1990 in Kansas City, Missouri.  The meeting will provide a                     
              focal point and synthesis of a group of diverse aspects of                     
              the basis of protein structure and function.  These include:                   
              protein folding, fluctuations in protein structure, protein-                   
              water interactions, thermodynamics of protein interaction,                     
              regulatory interactions in proteins, thermodynamics of enzyme                  
              catalysis, multifrequency enthalpic fluctuations, kinetics                     
              and thermodynamics of conformational processes, and the                        
              thermodynamics of protein engineering.
