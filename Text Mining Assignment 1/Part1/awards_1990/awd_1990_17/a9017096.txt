Abstract    :
                   This project focuses on a model for Quaternary blind thrusting            
              in the southwestern Sacramento Valley based on preliminary analysis            
              of seismic reflection data.  The study will develop and use a                  
              methodology for distinguishing between active fault-bend and fault-            
              propagation folding based on the interaction between fault                     
              kinematics and surficial processes.  Results are expected to                   
              provide criteria to distinguish fold styles in active blind                    
              thrusting, which will be useful in seismic risk analysis and                   
              neotectonics generally.
