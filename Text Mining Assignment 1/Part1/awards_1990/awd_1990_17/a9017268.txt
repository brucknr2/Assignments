Abstract    :
              This study will address the question: What are the physiological               
              characteristics of those microorganisms that are responsible for               
              the mineralization processes in the deep sea? And more                         
              specifically: Are the temperature and pressure adaptations of                  
              deep-sea bacteria invariable with nutrition? Strains from a                    
              stock of known barophilic (pressure tolerant) organisms, as well               
              as freshly-obtained deep sea isolates, will be used. Growth                    
              experiments will be carried out: 1. as continuous culture                      
              experiments at atmospheric pressure, and at in situ substrate                  
              concentrations and a temperature range of 2-20 oC; and 2. as                   
              batch cultures at in situ pressures, and temperatures again of 2-              
              20 oC and nutrient substrates at the experimentally lowest                     
              possible concentrations attainable. Under experimental                         
              conditions, changes in population density (cell counts and                     
              biomass) and/or radioactive substrate turnover will be used as a               
              sensitive indicator of growth rate response to changes of the                  
              various controllable environmental factors: temperature, pressure              
              and substrate concentration. This study potentially will provide               
              new insights into factors regulating microbial growth and the                  
              rates of microbial transformations of matter in deep sea                       
              environments.
