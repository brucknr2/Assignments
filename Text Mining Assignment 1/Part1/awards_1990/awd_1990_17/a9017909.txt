Abstract    :
                   Stress-inversion methods, used by structural geologists to                
              estimate a regional stress tensor from populations of faults that              
              contain slickenlines, rely on the basic assumptions that (1) the               
              regional stress field is homogeneous in space and time, and (2)                
              slip on each fault plane occurs in the direction of resolved                   
              regional shear stress.  These assumptions ignore the effects of                
              fault shape, the earth's surface, frictional anisotropy, and the               
              proximity to nearby faults, any of which could result in a                     
              significant difference between the direction of resolved shear                 
              stress and the direction of fault slip.  Mechanical modeling of                
              common fault geometries using existing computer code DIS3D provides            
              a means to evaluate the magnitude of this difference.  The goal is             
              to distinguish those geological circumstances under which existing             
              stress-inversion techniques are reliable, from those that give                 
              unreliable answers.  The results will provide new and important                
              insights concerning fault behavior.
