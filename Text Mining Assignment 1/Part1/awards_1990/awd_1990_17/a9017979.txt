Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              This research is focused on quantitative studies of organic                    
              carbon diagenesis in rapidly accumulating coastal and upper                    
              slope sediments.  The intermeshing goals reflect the central                   
              processes associated with accumulation and recycling of organic                
              materials in all organic-rich marine environments.  The goals                  
              are:  1) to quantify seasonal variations in the sources and                    
              input rates of organic matter to coastal sediments, 2) to                      
              understand the role of organic carbon source in controlling the                
              rate and extent of organic carbon degradation, 3) to elucidate                 
              the role of bacterial assimilation of DOC ("secondary                          
              production") in the sediment carbon cycle, and 4) to determine                 
              the rates and pathways of organic carbon fermentation.
