Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              There has been considerable progress in our understanding of the               
              segmentation patterns on mid-ocean ridge system, but little has                
              been learned about the nature and temporal stability of upper                  
              mantle processes associated withthe segmentation. A field survey               
              will be carried out over a 250 km wide area of Mid-Atlantic                    
              Ridge using Hydrosweep to obtain bathymetric coverage, along with              
              acquisition of gravity and magnetic data. These data will allow                
              testing of hypotheses concerning temporal evolution of the ridge               
              related tosegmentation processes of the spreading center. This is              
              a US-France collaborative research project.
