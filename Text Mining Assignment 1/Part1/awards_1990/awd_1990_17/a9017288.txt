Abstract    :
              Scanning tunneling microscopy will be used to study how low                    
              coverages of chemically active surface modifiers, to include                   
              sulfur, oxygen, and phosphorous, affect the adsorption and                     
              dissociation of small molecules of catalytic interest, such as                 
              carbon monoxide, methane, and methanol, on transition metal                    
              surfaces, such as molybdenum (100), tungsten (100), and nickel                 
              (100).  STM will be used to image molecules and impurities, and to             
              probe local variations in atomic geometry, electron structure, and             
              work function.  The goal is to control electronic structure                    
              modification, and the ability to tune chemical reactivity.
