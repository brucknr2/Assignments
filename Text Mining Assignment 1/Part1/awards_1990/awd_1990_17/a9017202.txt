              research technician for a period of three year. The technician will            
              be working in the electron microprobe and electron microscope                  
              facility in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at The              
              Johns Hopkins University.                                                      
                   The technician will help maintain and operate the facility and            
              perform analyses for research projects in metamorphic and igneous              
              petrology, mineralogy, crystallography and geochemistry in the                 
              Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences and will also make the              
              facility available to researchers in the departments of Biophysics,
