Abstract    :
                   Xylaria is a large (at least 400 names and ultimately 500 or              
              more species) widely distributed fungal genus (Family                          
              Xylariaceae, Order Sphaeriales, Subdivision Ascomycotina).  Many               
              taxa occur on wood, seeds and fruits, and leaves of angiospermous              
              plants; some taxa are associated with insect nests.  Most taxa                 
              decay wood and a large number are plant pathogens.  They are                   
              common endophytes.  Xylaria and its allies are most numerous in                
              the tropics where they form a conspicuous part of the mycota.                  
              Many taxa are endemic and likely to become extinct as hosts are                
              destroyed.  Mycofloristic studies that include cultural,                       
              anamorphic, cytological, structural, and life history data are                 
              proposed.  It is proposed herein:  to continue studies of Xylaria              
              from the Guianas; to treat Xylaria and its allies from Taiwan; to              
              complete treatments of Xylaria from continental United States,                 
              Hawaii, and Puerto Rico.  Longer term objectives include a                     
              treatment of Xylaria of the neotropics and, eventually, a world                
              monograph.
