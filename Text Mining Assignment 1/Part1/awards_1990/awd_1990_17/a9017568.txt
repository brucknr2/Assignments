Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The objective of this research program is to                                   
              investigate evidence for the time-dependent                                    
              nonlinear behavior of soil resulting from                                      
              earthquake-induced strong ground shaking.                                      
              The evidence is being sought in the                                            
              accelerograms recorded during the 1979                                         
              Imperial Valley earthquake.                                                    
                                                                                             
              During this earthquake, accelerogram records                                   
              were obtained of the strong ground motion at                                   
              the Differential Array station and at the                                      
              Array No.1 free-field location.  These                                         
              records are being analyzed in detail to                                        
              determine the time-dependent character of the                                  
              apparent stiffness reduction of the                                            
              underlying soil during this event.                                             
                                                                                             
              The analysis consists of: (1) Dividing each                                    
              of the two accelerograms into several time                                     
              windows representing (a) the weak motion                                       
              prior to the S-wave arrival, (b) the initial                                   
              portion of strong shaking beginning with S-                                    
              wave arrival, (c) the middle and latter                                        
              portions of strong shaking, and (d) the                                        
              weaker motions at the ends of the records;                                     
              (2) computing the Fourier Amplitude Spectra                                    
              of each time segment in each accelerogram;                                     
              (3) calculating the ratio (transfer function)                                  
              of the Differential Array and Array No.1                                       
              Fourier Amplitude Spectra for each time                                        
              segment; (4) noting any changes in the                                         
              frequency at which the first prominent peak                                    
              in the transfer function occurs; (5)                                           
              estimating the associated shear-modulus                                        
              reductions implied by the frequency changes;                                   
              and (6) estimating the soil-shearing strain                                    
              from the integrated accelerograms and shear-                                   
              wave velocity profile of the underlying soil.                                  
                                                                                             
              The results of this analysis will indicate                                     
              the presence of any time-dependent nonlinear                                   
              behavior; and, if present, it will suggest                                     
              whether this behavior occurred gradually or                                    
              suddenly; and whether during the end of the                                    
              shaking the shear-modulus of the soil                                          
              returned to its initial state prior to the                                     
              strong ground shaking.  These effects are                                      
              very relevant to earthquake hazard                                             
              mitigation.
