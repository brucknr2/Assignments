Abstract    :
              This project is aimed at completing the dating of the Rajmahal,                
              Deccan, CRB and the Siberian Traps, as well as obtaining                       
              equivalent data for the Serra Geral Province.  The work will                   
              provide data for rigorous testing of hypotheses suggesting                     
              periodicity in flood basalt volcanism, their genetic link to                   
              lithospheric rifting episodes, global faunal extinction and/or                 
              bolide impact events.  Collaboration with Prof. Edward Farrar at               
              Queen's University is planned.
