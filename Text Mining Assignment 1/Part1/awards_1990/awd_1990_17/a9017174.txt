Abstract    :
              The goal of this research project is to develop computational                  
              methods for investigating the dynamical behavior of chaotic                    
              attractors resulting from systems of differential equations of                 
              moderately high dimension.  The emphasis is on systems of equations            
              arising from inertial manifold reductions of PDE's governing fluid             
              flows at and somewhat beyond the onset of instabilities and                    
              turbulence.  The PI's interest is in characterizing the low                    
              dimensional dynamics of systems which potentially have 10-100                  
              degrees of freedom.  The principal components of the proposed work             
              include: the development of accurate numerical methods for the                 
              precise calculation of stable and unstable manifolds of attractors             
              in more than three dimensions; use of real-time color graphics for             
              improved visualization of the geometric structure of saddle orbits             
              and the associated manifolds; and the use of vectorized algorithms             
              to exploit the power of new computer hardware.  The algorithms and             
              resulting software packages are intended to assist applied                     
              mathematicians, engineers, physicists, and students investigating              
              the dynamical behavior of systems of nonlinear ordinary and partial            
              differential equations.
