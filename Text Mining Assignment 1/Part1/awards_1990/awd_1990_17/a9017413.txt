Abstract    :
                   The Vertebrate Paleontology collection at the Texas Memorial              
              Museum, University of Texas, includes 150,000 catalogued                       
              specimens, 156 types and vouchers, and is one of the most                      
              valuable research collections of its kind in the U.S.  The                     
              collection's strengths are in the diverse Texas Mesozoic fauna,                
              Devonian fishes, and Tertiary mammals of the south and southwest.              
              Dr. Ernest Lundelius, Director of the Vertebrate Paleontology and              
              Radiocarbon Laboratory in the Texas Memorial Museum, has devised               
              a three-year plan for continued improvement to the collection.                 
              This phase would include installation of new specimen storage                  
              cabinets, new storage racks for very large specimens, and would                
              replace the outdated computer equipment that currently hampers                 
              the database operations.  Curatorial projects would continue to                
              improve the availability of specimens and the accuracy and                     
              accessibility of specimen-related data.                                        
                   The proposed collection improvement will have significant                 
              impact on the paleontological research community.  The vertebrate              
              fossils in the Texas Memorial Museum are heavily used by research              
              paleontologists in studies of evolution, paleoecology, and global              
              change.  Improving the accessibility of these collections will                 
              benefit generations of research scientists.
