Abstract    :
              The efficient processing of spatial data plays an important role               
              in solving problems in computer vision, robotics, and computer                 
              graphics.  The acquisition of spatial data as well as its                      
              processing will be investigated.  The acquisition will be                      
              concerned with data useful for cartographic applications (e.g.,                
              terrains) and maps in general.  In the case of maps, the interest              
              is in the acquisition of relative spatial information (e.g.,                   
              based on a map's legend) rather than precise information                       
              (e.g., locations of cities, roads, etc.).  An investigation into               
              the concept of a hypermap and the related representation issues                
              will be conducted.  Other problems include the investigation of                
              hierachical surface representations, large spatial databases                   
              (especially those including line segments).  Attempts will be                  
              made to parallize any algorithms that are developed and they will              
              be tested on the Connection Machine.
