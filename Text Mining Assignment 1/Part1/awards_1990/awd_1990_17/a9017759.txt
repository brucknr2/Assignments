Abstract    :
                   One of the critical regions of the magnetosphere is the                   
              magnetotail, which is thought to be responsible for                            
              magnetospheric substorms, which are intervals of time that are                 
              associated with enhanced currents and intensification of the                   
              auroral (i.e. northern lights).  This grant concentrates on three              
              problems concerning the plasma physics of the magnetotail:  1)                 
              the origin of mid-frequency electrostatic plasma waves, 2)                     
              collisionless tearing mode reconnection in teh closed magnetic                 
              field-line region of the plasma sheet, and 3) the structure of                 
              collisionless shocks in the distant tail.  These problems will be              
              attached using observations, analytic theory and numerical                     
              simulations.
