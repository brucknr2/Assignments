Abstract    :
              The are two molybdenite polytypes; a hexagonal (2H) and the more               
              rare rhombohedral (3R). The purpose of this study is to                        
              determine which molybdenite polytype is most likely to remain                  
              closed to Re-Os exchange after deposition.  The PI proposes to                 
              obtain molybdenites from different types of ore-deposits of known              
              age, and determine the polytype by XRD analysis and analyze the                
              Re-Os abundances by isotope dilution using an ICP-MS.  The second              
              purpose of this work is to determine the Re-Os isotope                         
              systematics of sulfides from porphyry copper/molybdenum deposits               
              from Arizona, New Mexico, northern Mexico, Nevada and Utah in                  
              order to constrain the crust/mantle input of metals into these                 
              systems.
