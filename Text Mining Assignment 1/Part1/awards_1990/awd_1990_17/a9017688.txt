Abstract    :
                   This award provides 50% funding for the acquisition of a                  
              computer system that will be installed and operated in the                     
              Department of Geophysics at Stanford University. The University                
              is committed to providing the remaining funding required.                      
                   The computer system will be used in the research of the                   
              seismology group at Stanford and will be applied to problems such              
              as modeling earthquake source mechanisms, very low frequency ground            
              motion ("quiet earthquakes"), and seismic tomographic techniques.
