Abstract    :
                This research is to study the historic earthquakes (1906-1960)               
              that have occurred along the South American subduction zone;                   
              eleven earthquakes have occurred between 1906 and 1960 with                    
              magnitudes greater than 7.8.  The results will be compared with                
              recent, post-1963, earthquakes that have occurred along the South              
              American subduction zone.  The goal is to obtain a more complete               
              picture of subduction zone earthquakes, fault segmentation and                 
              rupture mode along this active plate boundary.  By this means,                 
              better constraints on the seismic hazards and seismic potential                
              along this and other subduction zones can be estimated.  This                  
              research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard                      
              Reduction Program.
