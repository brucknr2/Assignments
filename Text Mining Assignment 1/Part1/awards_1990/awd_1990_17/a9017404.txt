Abstract    :
              This project will analyze the Hf and Nd isotopic, and trace                    
              element characteristics of different types of mantle materials                 
              and has three main goals:                                                      
              1) to determine the Hf-Nd-isotopic compositions of peridotites.                
              Abyssal peridotites and peridotitic material from ocean islands                
              and continents will be studied to constrain the relationship                   
              between peridotites and mantle melts.  Furthermore, this study                 
              will attempt to constrain the ages of the Hf-depletions which                  
              are a common occurrence in peridotites, and it will test whether               
              Hf and Nd isotopes are correlated in peridotite materials.                     
              2) to evaluate the use of the combined Hf-Nd isotope systems as                
              indicators for degree and depth of melting of mid-ocean ridge                  
              basalts as proposed by Salters and Hart (1989).  These melt                    
              parameters will be calibrated against those proposed by Klein and              
              Langmuir (1987; 1989).                                                         
              3) to determine the extent of the MORB and OIB field on a Hf-Nd                
              isotope correlation diagram, with the goal of constraining the                 
              mixing relationships between MORB and OIB.
