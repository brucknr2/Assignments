Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              In many jurisdictions the Uniform Building                                     
              Code, UBC (ICBO, 1988), regulates the design                                   
              for lateral wind and seismic forces.                                           
              However, most architecture students and                                        
              architecture design firms find these                                           
              regulations difficult to interpret and apply                                   
              for multi-story buildings.  Therefore,                                         
              lateral design is often not considered in the                                  
              early design process as it should be when                                      
              important decisions are made that affect                                       
              lateral forces.                                                                
                                                                                             
              This proposal makes lateral design simpler                                     
              and more transparent, visualizes effects of                                    
              building form on lateral forces, and                                           
              facilitates trade-off studies for creative                                     
              integration in the early design process.  The                                  
              project will:  1) develop a computer program                                   
              for lateral design by means of tables and                                      
              graphs, and 2) develop paper graphs for use                                    
              without a computer.  No such graphs have been                                  
              available to architects in designing for                                       
              lateral forces.                                                                
                                                                                             
              This project will fill in this gap by                                          
              allowing architects and students of                                            
              architecture to consider earthquake resistant                                  
              design in the early stages of building                                         
              design.  As such, the proposed products                                        
              resulting from this project will have a                                        
              direct application to the earthquake                                           
              resistant design process at an early stage.                                    
              It is very timely.
