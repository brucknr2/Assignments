Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              The investigator proposes to develop parallel methods for                      
              solving unconstrained optimization problems and to                             
              implement them on a 1024-processor hypercube such as the                       
              NCUBE 1 machine at the University of South Carolina.  In                       
              particular, she proposes to parallelize those parts of the                     
              algorithm that are costly and where speedups are most                          
              useful, namely the linear algebra solution and updating.                       
              The PI wants to approach the problem by finding updating                       
              strategies for the Hessian on the basis of the type of                         
              linear equation solver used to find the direction dk.                          
              These would not include, for example, the factored or                          
              unfactored parallel versions of the BFGS method using                          
              either the Hessian or its inverse since these have already                     
              been parallelized.  The PI would consider two methods for                      
              solving linear equations:  a) the LU factorization or some                     
              variation of it, and b) an iterative method using multiple                     
              blocks.  In summary, the PI would like to parallelize a                        
              quasi-Newton method for solving unconstrained optimization                     
              problems using LU updates and to find updating schemes for                     
              the Hessian where the Hessian is split into multiple                           
              blocks.
