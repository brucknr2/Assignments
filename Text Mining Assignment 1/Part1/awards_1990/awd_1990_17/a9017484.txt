Abstract    :
              This project will continue the operation of the Fabry-Perot                    
              interferometer that was installed at South Pole Station in early               
              1989.  The instrument measures the temperature of the atmosphere               
              and the winds in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MALT)                  
              region of the upper atmosphere.  The instrument will be operated               
              in conjunction with the existing collection of aeronomy instruments            
              at South Pole, as well as with the coherent scatter radar at Halley            
              Bay Station which is jointly funded by NSF and the British                     
              Antarctic Survey (BAS).  Together they will give a more complete               
              picture of high altitude atmospheric dynamics at high latitude, and            
              provide important information for the verification and subsequent              
              modification of the thermospheric global circulation model that has            
              been developed at the National Center for Atmospheric Research.                
              This project is an important component of the Coupling, Energetic              
              and Dynamics through Atmospheric Regions (CEDAR) initiative.                   
                                                                                             
              This project is jointly funded by the Division of Polar Programs'              
              Polar Aeronomy and Astrophysics and the Division of Atmospheric                
              Sciences' Aeronomy programs.
