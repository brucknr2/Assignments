Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Phytoplankton, as dominant primary producers of the world's                    
              oceans, are important components in the biogeochemical cycling                 
              of many elements. There is a lack of information, however, as to               
              the role of phytoplankton in the biogeochemical cycling of iodine              
              specifically in terms of fluxes, metabolism and reservoir size.                
              This project seeks to address this deficiency by using important               
              marine phytoplankton (diatoms, dinoflagellates,                                
              coccolithophores, cyanobacteria) in experiments to determine: 1)               
              iodide and iodate uptake rates (using radioactive 125I); 2) the                
              concentration and chemical speciation of cellular iodine  by                   
              using iodide selective electrodes, extraction techniques, and                  
              125I labeled cultures; 3) release rates of both volatile                       
              (primarily methyl iodide, using gas chromatography with an                     
              electron capture detector) and non-volatile cellular iodocarbons               
              (125I labeled cultures), and 4) the presence of haloperoxidases                
              in phytoplankton (spectrophotometric and radioisotopic methods).               
              The data obtained from these investigations will allow for the                 
              unambiguous assessment of the degree in which phytoplankton are                
              involved in the chemical speciation of iodine in surface waters                
              and their participation in the transport of iodine from the                    
              surface waters to the atmosphere and to deeper waters. This                    
              research has application to the marine and atmospheric iodine                  
              cycles, which takes on added importance based on past and                      
              potential releases of anthropogenic radionuclides of iodine.
