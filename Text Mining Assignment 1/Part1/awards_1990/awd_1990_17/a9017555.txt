Abstract    :
                   The type of computing environment dawning on the engineering              
              campus is significantly different from that which was available                
              just a few years ago and is radically different from the                       
              environment under which traditional mechanical design education                
              developed.                                                                     
              %%%                                                                            
                   The aims of this research are the development of a                        
              mathematical model for the mechanical design process and the                   
              development of prototype teaching aid for a computer environment.              
              Such a computer aid will provide an interactive, self-paced problem            
              drill environment. In addition, it will provide an electronic                  
              workbench for problem solving. The major thrust of the work will               
              be the development of a quantitative theory for the design process             
              that will then allow the exploitation of the full power of a                   
              workstation computer environment in mechanical engineering                     
              education. A general set of software, hopefully applicable to other            
              disciplines, will be tested through the development of several sets            
              of course materials for mechanical engineering design courses. The             
              study will conclude with an evaluation of the technical and                    
              educational merits of such a system.
