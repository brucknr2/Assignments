Abstract    :
              This project is for a Hf and (where needed) Nd isotopic study of               
              (1) a wide-ranging set of granites derived from crustal sources                
              that were old at time of melting, and (2) a reference suite of                 
              granites derived from juvenile sources.  Samples will be from the              
              PIs'own collections, from other published studies and from a                   
              proposed new collection of 1.4 Ga granites from the S.W. USA.                  
              Also planned is a study of the resilience of the Lu-Hf isotopic                
              system in deformed/altered rocks.  Lu-Hf, Sm-Nd and Rb-Sr results              
              for a mylonitized Proterozoic granite are described, and studies               
              of changes that occur in potassic metasomatism, in HCl-rich and                
              in F-rich alteration environments are planned.
