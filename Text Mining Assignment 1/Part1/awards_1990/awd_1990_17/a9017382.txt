Abstract    :
                   Recent Paleomagnetic studies of the Chinle and Moenave                    
              Formations of the Western United States have shown that J-1 cusp               
              in the North American APW path is sharp and its age is confined                
              to the late Norian to early Sinemurian interval.  This renewal                 
              will examine younger rocks of the Morrison Formation to further                
              substantiate the nature of the cusp and the APW path.  Results                 
              would be of considerable importance to paleogeography of North                 
              America and its tectonostratigraphic terranes.
