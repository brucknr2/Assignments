Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will investigate the nonlinear analysis                           
              methods using a concept of a concentrated plastic hinge to                     
              estimate the resistance to combined axial, biazial and                         
              torsional forces.  The technique will be used to analyze                       
              and design three dimensional steel structures by                               
              integrating computer-aided methodlogies.
