Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This special award will give graduate student Xavier Lopez                
              additional flexibility in pursuing his graduate studies and research           
              initiation in geography.  The award will permit this student to take           
              additional technical courses and to attend a professional meeting.  His        
              research will focus on the use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS)         
              for assessing the environmental impacts of urban development.                  
                                                                                             
                   This award grows out of a special program in the NSF Biological,          
              Behavioral, and Social Sciences Directorate to enhance the graduate            
              education of previous applicants for minority fellowships who were             
              awarded honorable mention ratings.  This award should strengthen               
              research participation in geography and regional science by a promising        
              student who is a member of an underrepresented minority group.
