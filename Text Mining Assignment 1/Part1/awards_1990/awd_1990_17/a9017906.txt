Abstract    :
              Current devices to screen the hearing of newborn infants                       
              are cumbersome to use, and consequently infants who are                        
              not expected to be at high risk for deafness generally do                      
              not get examined.   This proposal is to develop a small                        
              and convenient data acquisition system that will allow                         
              the collection of auditory evoked potentials, which, when                      
              appropriately analyzed, will allow the discrimination                          
              between normal and hearing-impaired infants.   The                             
              request is for the support of a specific graduate                              
              student; she has experience uniquely suited for the                            
              proposed task.
