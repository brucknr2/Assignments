Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This award will support the development of comparative                    
              standard samples for the quantitative analysis of the element                  
              oxygen with the microanalytical electron probe technique.                      
              Although oxygen is the most abundant element on earth, its                     
              concentration in minerals and synthetic materials is usually                   
              inferred by making assumptions about charge balance and                        
              stoichiometry.  The capability to directly analyze oxygen                      
              concentration on a microanalytical scale will constitute an                    
              important analytical advance in mineralogy and materials science.
