Abstract    :
              This ongoing project is designed to determine the nature, origin               
              and derivation of the Laramie Anorthosite Complex (LAC) by                     
              detailed mapping, petrography and mineral chemistry of selected                
              samples, major and trace elements of some whole rocks, and Sr and              
              Nd isotopic analyses. The PIs are particularly interested in Fe-               
              Ti oxide deposits associated with most anorthosites which are                  
              reserves of titanium.  The study should help determine the origin              
              of the Laramie suite, and should increase understanding of                     
              similar rocks that occur at several locations world-wide.
