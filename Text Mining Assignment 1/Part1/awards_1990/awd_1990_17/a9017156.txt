Abstract    :
              Research is proposed in two areas within the field of high-                    
              temperature superconductivity: continued testing of the univers-               
              ality of the electronic Raman continuum by studying new high-                  
              temperature superconductors (HTSCs) and variations on existing                 
              HTSCs; and the careful comparison of Raman spectra with other                  
              measurements on well-characterized, single-crystal samples.                    
                                                                                             
              Even as research on high-temperature superconductivity is                      
              becoming more mature and more orderly, the pace of discovery, the              
              intensity of competition and the complexity of the subject make                
              it unique in condensed-matter physics and materials science.
