Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              An important aspect of cell growth--how necessary nutrients get                
              into the cell (transport)--is poorly understood in terms of ther               
              actual molecular mechanisms of transport and the proteins                      
              responsible for it.  The proline transport mutants of Salmonella               
              will be used for studies of the molecular mechanism of sodium-                 
              driven transport.  By selection for particular classes of mutants,             
              domains of the protease involved in substrate binding and                      
              translocation will be identified; with the aid of site directed                
              mutagenesis of the implicated residues it whould be possible to                
              test the predicted roles of certain amino acids and come to                    
              understand, with the aid of biochemical and biophysical approaches,            
              the conformational changes necessary for substrate translocation.              
              Elucidation of the structure-function relationships of ion-driven              
              transport proteins should result from such examinations.
