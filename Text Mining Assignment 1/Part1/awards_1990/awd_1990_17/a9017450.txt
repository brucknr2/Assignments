Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal is directed to understanding metal-ceramic                       
              interfacial reactions and how they are influenced by chemical                  
              segregation and defects at the ceramic surface.  Initial focus is              
              on alumina and silica surfaces and use of dopants to modify                    
              surface properties.  Bonding to both reactive and noble metals                 
              are examined; examples include titanium, gold and platinum.  X-                
              ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is used to study composition              
              and chemical states at the surfaces.
