Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                     The magnetic effects of low and high temperature                       
              hydrothermal alteration on titanomagnetite in oceanic rocks are                
              poorly understoods. The objective of this study is to examine the              
              lower crust rocks of Josephine Ophiolite with empkhasis on the                 
              alteration effects on magnetic properties. The study will lead to              
              a better understanding of the importance of dykes and gobbros on               
              magnetic anomalies.
