Abstract    :
              The PIs plan to continuously collect and telemeter fumarole                    
              temperature data at the summit dome of Colima volcano in Mexico.               
              They will simultaneously monitor variations in the Earth's                     
              magnetic field intensity induced by changes in the bulk                        
              temperature of the dome, precipitation rates and seismic events.               
              These data will provide a comprehensive view of conductive and                 
              convective heat transfer within the summit dome.  Resulting                    
              models should aid in the interpretation of fumarole temperature                
              data gathered at other volcanoes and provide new insight into the              
              use of fumarole monitoring in the mitigation of volcanic hazards.
