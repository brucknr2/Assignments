Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal represents a novel approach to room temperature                  
              growth/deposition of semiconductor materials.  The method is based             
              on electrochemistry, and is named ECALE--Electrochemical Atomic                
              Layer Epitaxy.  Polycrystalline materials have been deposited by               
              electrochemical means previously; this project will employ                     
              alternated electrodeposition of monolayers in an attempt to achieve            
              epitaxial growth.  Specially processed and cleaned single crystal              
              substrates will be used; the substrates and the deposited films                
              will be characterized by LEED, AES, HREELS, and STM along with more            
              routine optical and electron microscopy.
