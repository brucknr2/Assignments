Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              In previous work, this group has developed a model that describes              
              hydrogen bonding interactions in polymers.  In experimental studies            
              to this point, the group has successfully tested the ability of                
              this model to predict broad trends in the phase behavior of various            
              system.  In the research to be carried out, an attempt will be made            
              to develop a much more quantitative study of the degree of validity            
              of this approach.  The work will include: a)  An investigation of              
              the extent to which we need to account for "free volume";  b) FTIR             
              studies of carefully selected copolymer systems; c)  Studies of                
              melting point depression in blends where one component                         
              crystallizes; d)  Scattering studies, in collaboration with                    
              Dr. Charles Han of NIST.                                                       
                                                                                             
              The long-term goal is to understand and predict the phase behavior             
              of polymeric mixtures that involve strong directionally specific               
              interactions.
