Abstract    :
              The principal investigator proposes to study the Smartville                    
              complex in the northwestern Sierra Nevada to determine its                     
              thermal structure, constrain its thermal history, and in general               
              to test the hypothesis that metamorphic effects at collisional                 
              continent-ocean margins are more the result of precollisional                  
              phases of arc volcanism than of tectonic and thermal effects from              
              the collision itself.  The study will focus on the chemistry and               
              paragenesis of pumpellyite-bearing rocks, and is to include                    
              determination of ferric: ferrous ratios in pumpellyite itself as               
              a critical component, as well as a detailed petrologic study of                
              the complex and a comparison with correlative 160 Ma rocks along               
              the length of the western Sierra Nevada.
