Abstract    :
                   The proposed research consists of studies of chemical                     
              processes of importance in the atmosphere which involve cloud                  
              particles.  There are strong indications that polar stratospheric              
              clouds are chemically very active, transforming stable chlorine                
              compounds to a form that efficiently promotes ozone depletion.                 
              The studies in this proposal are aimed at elucidating the                      
              mechanism for such processes, and at measuring parameters such as              
              chemical reaction rates, which are needed to model the behavior                
              of the polar stratosphere and to predict future effects of the                 
              release of man-made chlorofluorocarbons.                                       
                   More specifically, the PI plans to characterize the various               
              ices of atmospheric interest (which consist of water with                      
              varying amounts of HNO3, H2SO4 and HCl) by means of thermal                    
              analysis techniques such as differential scanning calorimetry,                 
              and by infrared and ultraviolet spectrophotometry and to measure               
              the vapor pressures of HCl for the various ices as a function of               
              the ice composition via mass spectrometry.  The PI also plans to               
              determine reaction probabilities for ClONO2 and N2O5 vapors                    
              interacting with ices containing amounts of HCl which are                      
              appropriate for stratospheric conditions.
