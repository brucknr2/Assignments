Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Secretion, the formation of lysosomes, and receptor-mediated                   
              endocytosis are all mediated by intracellular packaging and                    
              transport of vesicles.  Intraorganelle communication also involves             
              the transport of vesicles.  Some of these transport processes                  
              utilize nucleotide-sensitive, microtubule-binding proteins to power            
              the vesicles movement along microtubules.  The goal of this                    
              research is to investigate one of these motors, cytoplasmic dynein,            
              which this laboratory has recently isolated from Paramecium.  The              
              vesicle and vacuole transport pathways in Paramecium have been                 
              studied extensively in this laboratory.  A logical extension of                
              the previous studies is to characterize further the motor(s)                   
              responsible for the described movements and to investigate the                 
              possibility that microtubules organized into different arrays may              
              support movement of only certain populations of vesicles and not               
              others.  Experiments have been designed to (1) determine which                 
              direction cytoplasmic dynein moves along the microtubules in                   
              Paramecium, and (2) to produce monospecific polyclonal and                     
              monoclonal antibodies to cytoplasmic dynein to determine the                   
              location of this motor in the cell and to use as antagonists to                
              cytoplasmic dynein activity to determine which transport functions             
              in cells are supported by this motor.  Finally, it is proposed to              
              isolate all vesicles which bind to microtubules by nucleotide-                 
              sensitive bridges.                                                             
                                                                                             
              The results of this research using Paramecium should provide new               
              information on how normal cells direct and regulate intracellular              
              vesicular transport.
