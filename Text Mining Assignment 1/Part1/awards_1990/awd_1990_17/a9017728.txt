Abstract    :
                   There is increasing evidence that the geomagnetic dipole                  
              moment was less than one half of its present value prior to                    
              15,000 B.P.  This would lead to an increase in 10Be and 14C                    
              production by 40%.  Short term variations in the cosmic ray flux               
              are also thought to have occurred.  For example, two spikes in                 
              10Be concentrations in the Vostok ice core from Antarctica have                
              been found.  It seems unlikely that they were formed due to a                  
              change in climatic conditions.  The increase of 10Be is probably               
              due to an increase in production of 10Be due to increased cosmic               
              ray activity in the atmosphere induced by supernovae or                        
              geomagnetic excursions.  A hemipelagic sediment core from the                  
              Blake Outer Ridge and a varved sediment core from the Gulf of                  
              California offer a good opportunity to observe variations in 10Be              
              and 14C production during the last 100,000 years because of                    
              continuous, constant, and high rate of sedimentation on the                    
              cores.  Ocean sediments should provide an important archive of                 
              data concerning changes in 10Be production.  Unlike the ice                    
              cores, the ca. 300-year residence time of 10Be in the sea                      
              minimizes local variations due to climate.  Correlation of 10Be                
              "events" between both cores should establish whether the events                
              are of worldwide or local origin.  In addition, paleomagnetic                  
              data have already been measured in the cores making correlation                
              possible with the 10Be production curve.  Sedimant samples are to              
              be analyzed for 10Be and 14C at the TAMS facility at the                       
              University of Arizona.  9Be will be measured by atomic absorption              
              spectrophotometry.  Reservoir models will be evaluated to define               
              the nature of the event.
