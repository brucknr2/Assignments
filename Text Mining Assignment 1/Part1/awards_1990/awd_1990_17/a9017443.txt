Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Newly developed nucleic acid probes will be used to study                      
              nitrogen cycling between dissolved substrate pools and                         
              bacteriain estuarine, coastal and open ocean waters.  It is                    
              anticipatedthat the implementation of these techniques will                    
              provide and approach to examine the relative importance of                     
              bacterial nitrogen sources where multiple sources with varying                 
              nutritional values are available.                                              
                                                                                             
              The focus of this research will be:  1) to complete the                        
              adaptation of a nucleic acid isolation/isotope measurement                     
              technique, which was used to trace bacterial carbon sources in                 
              estuarine waters, to one that will trace bacterial nitrogen                    
              sources in eutrophic and oligotrophic waters, 2) to continue                   
              development and field testing of a method to measure stable                    
              nitrogen isotopes in dissolved organic matter, and 3) to                       
              compare the isotopic discrimination between bacteria (isolated                 
              as nucleic acids) and nitrogen sources in eutrophic and                        
              oligotrophic waters.                                                           
                                                                                             
              Field work will be conducted on a transect from the Trinity                    
              River, Texas to the mouth of Galveston Bay out additional                      
              stations along the standard transect from Galveston Bay out to                 
              the 2000 m isobath in the Gulf of Mexico.
