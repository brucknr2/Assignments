Abstract    :
                   This grant supports participation by Dr. Zitzewitz and his                
              students in a new experiment being carried out at the                          
              University of Michigan-Ann Arbor, which measures the decay rate                
              of the positronium atom.  Zitzewitz will introduce                             
              modifications to the apparatus which will increase the                         
              precision of the measurement from 250 ppm to the 100 ppm level.
