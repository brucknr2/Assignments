Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              The objective of this project is to study the dynamic                          
              response of soils that have previously been subjected to                       
              anisotropic consolidation stresses.  A comprehensive                           
              testing program will be carried out using a resonant                           
              column device.  A parametric study of the factors which                        
              influence the response of each of the soils tested will be                     
              performed.  As a result, general guidelines along with                         
              empirical mathematical models are hoped to be developed                        
              which will enhance the engineer's knowledge in designing                       
              foundations under such soil conditions.  This study will                       
              focus on the shear moduli and damping characteristics of                       
              anisotropic soils.
