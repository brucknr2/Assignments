Abstract    :
                This research is to provide analysis support for a part of the               
              PACE seismic reflection/refraction study carried out by several                
              research groups across the tectonically active boundary between                
              the Colorado Plateau and the transition to the Basin and Range                 
              province.  The goal in analyzing this data set is to set                       
              constraints on the uplift process of the Colorado Plateau and,                 
              hopefully of plateaus in general.  The addition of reflection to               
              refraction data will give tighter control on the velocities to                 
              enable the study of rock properties, and more detail of the                    
              important structural transition across the Colorado Plateau.
