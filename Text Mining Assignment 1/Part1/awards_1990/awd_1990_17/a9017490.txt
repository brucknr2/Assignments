Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The activation of LHRH neural apparatus (a key neuronal system in              
              the control of reproduction) by neural and steroid signals thru a              
              membrane mechanism has become a research topic of great interest               
              in the field of Neuroscience and my laboratory has made                        
              contributions to clarify some aspects of such steroid-neural                   
              interactions.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              The present project to continue examining the binding                          
              characteristics of a novel ligand introduced by my laboratory, the             
              radio-iodinated albumin conjugated to progesterone in C-11 (the so-            
              called P-11-125I-BSA) to rat hypothalamic membrane fractions and its           
              modification by the hormonal status of the animal will clarify the             
              first step in the action of progesterone at membrane level.  The               
              recent demonstration that membranes from female rats but not from              
              male rats have specific binding shows an important sex difference              
              at this level in the CNS and may have important implications.  The             
              work of the present project may have clinical implications because             
              it will further our understanding of the effect of steroid hormones            
              in the function of the central nervous system and the role of                  
              gender in such actions.//
