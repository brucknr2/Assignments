Abstract    :
                   One of the most challenging problems in electronic materials              
              processing is the creation of a thin (1um) single crystal silicon              
              film on an insulating film (SiO2). The resulting product is a                  
              silicon-on-insulator system (SOI) and can be used as the building              
              block for many advanced applications. Through well established                 
              techniques such as chemical vapor deposition, a polycrystalline                
              silicon film can be easily created. The challenge is to                        
              recrystallize it in the form of a single crystal.                              
              %%%                                                                            
                   The proposed research plans to: (1) verify if the difficulties            
              of creating a single crystal are primarily driven by heat transfer;            
              and (2) try to establish heat transfer techniques to successfully              
              recrystallize thin silicon films in the form of single crystals.               
              If successful, these techniques will improve the quality of SOI                
              films used in the microelectronic industry.
