Abstract    :
              The Third International Symposium on Cold Regions Heat                         
              Transfer will be held June 12-14, 1991, at the University of                   
              Alaska, Fairbanks.  The overall purpose of the symposium is to                 
              bring together international researchers and engineers who are                 
              active in the areas of phase change in porous media, icing                     
              phenomena and frost formation, heat transfer in structures,                    
              mechanical systems for cold climates, and ground freezing and                  
              thawing.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              The forum will provide an environment for the review and                       
              dissemination of recent scientific and technical information                   
              related to all aspects of heat transfer in cold climates.
