Abstract    :
              Studying the molecular mechanisms of cold-adaptation of biological             
              systems is intrinsically important to understand evolution and                 
              ecological interaction of species on Earth.  In the Dry Valley                 
              region of Antarctica, a complete microbial ecosystem lives within              
              sandstone at freezing temperatures and in permanently ice-covered              
              lakes.  Vestal proposes to determine whether psychrophilic                     
              phototrophs (cold-adapted cyanobacteria, algae, and photosynthetic             
              bacteria) possess unique nucleotides and amino acids sequences in              
              their DNA and a key CO2-fixing enzyme in photosynthesis to account             
              for the enzyme's function at sub-zero temperatures.  From a                    
              previous award (Small Grant for Exploratory Research), Vestal                  
              determined that this key enzyme from a psychrophilic cyanobacterium            
              has unique photosynthetic properties that may be related to its                
              molecular structure of this particular CO2-fixing enzyme.  Using               
              the latest methods of molecular biology, true psychrophilic                    
              phototrophs, which will be selectively isolated from sandstone and             
              algal mats from Dry Valley lakes, will be studied.  If these                   
              Antarctic psychrophiles possess unique sequences in their DNA and              
              enzymes, the information would provide new insight into the                    
              mechanism of cold-adaptation of biological species and their                   
              evolutionary relatedness to other temperate species.
