Abstract    :
                This research is a collaborative effort to develop simultaneous              
              body-wave and surface-wave inversion methods for the earthquake                
              source.  The goal is to attain unified descriptions of earthquake              
              rupture processes using the entire spectrum of seismic and                     
              geodetic measurements.  Currently, even the most sophisticated                 
              analyses of different wave types (e.g., body waves and surface                 
              waves) often yield inconsistent fault parameters.  This                        
              inconsistency should be resolved by joint inversion.  The work                 
              will merge three different body-wave inversion methods, each                   
              appropriate for a certain class of earthquake rupture, with                    
              high-resolution, fundamental-mode surface-wave spectral-                       
              inversion techniques.  This research is a component of the                     
              National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
