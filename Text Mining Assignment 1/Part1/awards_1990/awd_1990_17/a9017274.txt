Abstract    :
              This project proposes to analyze glass inclusions in quartz                    
              phenocrysts from three tin-mineralized rhyolites of western                    
              North America for volatiles and Li, Be, Rb, Cs, Y, Nb, Ba, Sr,                 
              Th, Y, Mo, W, REE's and Sn by electron microprobe, ion                         
              microprobe, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.  The                  
              data will be integrated with existing information on the                       
              petrology, field relations, and whole rock geochemistry to better              
              understand the enrichment and depletion of volatiles, as well as               
              major, trace, and ore elements in evolved magmas.  The study will              
              determine how highly-evolved magmas become differentiated, will                
              constrain accurate values for the maximum concentrations of                    
              magmatic volatile constituents in such systems, and will relate                
              true magmatic volatile abundances to eruptive style.
