Abstract    :
                   This grant is for continuation of ongoing laboratory                      
              experimental measurements of a variety of double layer                         
              properties.  The emphasis of these investigations will continue                
              to be to better understand unmagnetized "stairstep" double                     
              layers, double layers with axial magnetic fields, oblique double               
              layers, and wall double layer-sheaths.  These studies are                      
              important because satellite and earth based data provide an                    
              incomplete picture of the structures which accelerate auroral                  
              electrons.
