Abstract    :
                   This research is designed to establish the morphological                  
              character, segmentation geometry, and structure of a significant               
              length of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge in the central North Atlantic, and            
              to test hypotheses on crustal accretion processes along a slowly               
              spreading mid-ocean ridge.  Questions to be addressed are: (1) What            
              is the effect of the Azores hotspot on the morphology, segmentation            
              geometry, and structure of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge? (2) Do major                
              fracture zones in the central North Atlantic separate portions of              
              the Mid-Atlantic Ridge with significantly different styles and                 
              wavelengths of segmentation? (3) How are differences in the pattern            
              of mantle Bouguer anomalies at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge related to               
              inter-segment morphotectonic variability? (4) What is the relative             
              abundance of conventional transform faults and non-transform                   
              discontinuities along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge? (5) What controls the            
              formation, stability, and evolution of non-transform offsets on the            
              Mid-Atlantic Ridge?  The principal investigators will participate              
              in two cruises of the French ship R/V l'Atalante.
