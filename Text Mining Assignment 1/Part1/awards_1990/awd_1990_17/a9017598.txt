Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Previous research suggests that the pattern of breast feeding, as              
              opposed to breast feeding per se, is the primary variable                      
              associated with differences in the length of lactational                       
              subfecundity.  This has not yet been clearly established on a                  
              longitudinal basis, however, in a naturally fertile population.                
              The research proposed her will investigate the relationship                    
              between lactating pattern and ovarian suppression, and will be                 
              the first prospective study in a naturally fertile population                  
              that uses direct observations of lactating activity combined with              
              hormonal correlations of ovarian activity.  Ovarian activity will              
              be assessed using the non-invasive technique of radioimmunoassay               
              of salivary hormones.  Thus, this study stands to make a                       
              significant contribution to our understanding of the relationship              
              between breast feeding patterns and fecundity, and the role of                 
              lactation in mediating birth intervals.
