Abstract    :
              This award supports a workshop to formulate a detailed                         
              science plan of coordinated investigations aimed at                            
              answering the key questions identified in the SeaRISE report                   
              (NASA, 1990).  These key questions address the goal of the                     
              SeaRISE initiative "to predict the contribution of marine                      
              ice sheets to rapid changes in global sea level in the next                    
              decade to centuries" through the attainment of the                             
              supporting objectives "to understand the current state,                        
              internal dynamics, interactions, and history of this                           
              environmental system".                                                         
                                                                                             
              This workshop will identify the required investigations and                    
              formulate a feasible field schedule of coordinate activities                   
              that, when completed, will achieve the SeaRISE goal and                        
              objectives.
