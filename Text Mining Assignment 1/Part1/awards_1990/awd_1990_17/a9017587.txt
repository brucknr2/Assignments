Abstract    :
              This project will continue  work on interstellar graphite and                  
              SiC grains with extreme isotopic anomalies in acid residues of                 
              carbonaceous meteorites.  Isotopic measurements will be made of                
              other minor elements and the PIs will also search  for new types               
              of interstellar material.  An attempt will be made to obtain                   
              noble gas isotopic data on individual grains, and to correlate                 
              them with ion probe isotopic measurements.
