Abstract    :
                This research is to tomographically map the 3-D seismic                      
              velocities around major subduction zones in the Circum-Pacific                 
              with corrected ISC data.  A major effort will be made to clean up              
              ISC readings by selective waveform checking, reviewing the                     
              signal/noise sate at seismographic stations, and culling                       
              incoherent rays from bins of similar source and receiver.  This                
              method will be applied to two formally studied regions in the NW               
              Pacific and the South Pacific.  New areas to be studied will be:               
              the Java, Solomon and Philippine region; the Mexico, Peru and                  
              Chile region; and the Aleutian region.  The results will be                    
              applied to the fate of deep subducted slabs, an important                      
              question in mantle convection.
