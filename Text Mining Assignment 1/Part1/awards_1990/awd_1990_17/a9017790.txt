Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will attempt to determine the solution              
              characteristics of highly charged cations in peralkaline,                      
              peraluminous, and metaluminous granitic to syenitic melts.  The                
              objectives are to establish a hierarchy of interactions of                     
              highly charged cations and network-forming modifying cations.  To              
              be determined are the magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic                    
              resonance and vibrational spectra of various glasses, the                      
              saturation surfaces of unary oxides containing one or more highly              
              charges cations (as a function of alkali/alumina ratio), and the               
              role of various fluid components in affecting stability and                    
              coordination states of highly charged cations.  Overall this work              
              will increase geologist' understanding of the complex                          
              interactions that exist within certain kinds of magmas.
