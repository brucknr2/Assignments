Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This high-resolution transmission electron microscope offers 0.18              
              nanometer point resolution in a side-entry stage configuration                 
              and also accommodates a large solid angle x-ray detector.  It                  
              will be housed in the new Materials Science Center of the College              
              of Engineering at the University of Wisconsin, and will create                 
              new opportunities and enhance the activities in several major                  
              research areas including fundamental studies of rapid                          
              solidification, high-resolution imaging of geological materials,               
              low-temperature and high-temperature superconducting materials                 
              development, metallizations on gallium-arsenide, supported metal               
              catalysts, ultrafine ceramic particles and membranes,                          
              crystallization of structural glass ceramics, and radiation                    
              damage in materials for fusion systems and plasma-source ion                   
              implantation processing.
