Abstract    :
              The objective of this effort is to examine research                            
              priorities and policy issues in bioprocess engineering of                      
              relevance to both specialty high-value products (e.g.,                         
              therapeutic drugs) and commodity, low-value chemical                           
              products (e.g., liquid fuels).  This will be done through                      
              the establishment of a committee of experts and the                            
              convening of two workshops addressing research needs and                       
              policy issues associated with specialty, high-value                            
              products and commodity. low-value chemical products.  A                        
              final report will be prepared that will provide a                              
              consensus opinion and present the needs and opportunities                      
              of the area for the next decade as biotechnology comes of                      
              age.                                                                           
                                                                                             
              A committee of experts will be recruited to address the                        
              needs of this study on bioprocess engineering.  The                            
              committee will be comprised of individuals from academe,                       
              industry, and government in areas such as bioprocess                           
              engineering, chemical engineering, molecular biology,                          
              cell, biology, quality assurance, and biosafety.  The                          
              committee will prepare a final report.
