Abstract    :
              Electric load demand is influenced in a highly complex                         
              manner by several variables such as time of day, day of                        
              the week, and weather variables such as temperature,                           
              humidity and wind speed.  The research proposed is to                          
              investigate the application of three different methods                         
              for applying neural network methodology to the                                 
              problem of short term load forecasting.                                        
                                                                                             
              The first approach will be a feedforward neural                                
              network using backpropagation.  A second approach                              
              will attempt to forecast using a neural network                                
              architecture using linear threshold units.  The third                          
              approach will use a neural network to model nonlinear                          
              system and weather dynamics using ideas drawn from                             
              deterministic chaos theory.  These approaches will be                          
              tested on actual load and weather data provided by a                           
              cooperating utility.
