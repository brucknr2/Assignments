Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              It is hypothesized that a significant inverse relationship                     
              exists between the 13C/12C of particulate organic matter (POM)                 
              and the ambient concentration of molecular CO2 in surface                      
              seawater.  This hypothesis will be tested by sampling and                      
              isotopically analyzing suspended POM in concert with NOAA-                     
              sponsored measurements of pCO2 and TCO2 i) at seasonally                       
              sampled stations near Hawaii and Bermuda, and ii) during cruise                
              transects in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans.  The results of                  
              this research will have significant implications for the use of                
              such isotopic measurements as a proxy for time-integrated                      
              ocean/atmospheric CO2 concentrations in the present ocean.                     
              This research will also aid in the reconstruction of past                      
              changes in global CO2 concentrations via isotopic variations in                
              the marine sedimentary record.  In addition, the concentrations                
              of surface water particulate organic carbon and nitrogen will                  
              be determined, and together with the isotopic determinations                   
              will complement NOAA- supported investigations of marine carbon                
              biogeochemistry.
