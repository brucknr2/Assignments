Abstract    :
              Continuing research under a Presidential Young Investigator                    
              award concerns the stability of wake flow past a sphere in the                 
              intermediate range of Reynolds number.  Both flow past a fixed                 
              sphere, as well as one free to move freely under the unsteady                  
              forcing of wake oscillations, is being analysed.  The methods                  
              are numerical integrations of the governing equations of                       
              motion of both fluid and sphere, as well as stability                          
              analysis.
