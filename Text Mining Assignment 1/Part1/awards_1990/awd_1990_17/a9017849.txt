Abstract    :
                   Heavy snowfalls are among the most disruptive of weather                  
              phenomena.  A joint program between the Federal Aviation                       
              Administration and the National Science Foundation entitled the                
              Winter Icing and Storms Project (WISP)  will be held in the                    
              winter of 1991.  The objectives of this program include the study              
              of snowstorms.                                                                 
                   The Principal Investigator will participate in this program               
              and will use both observational and numerical modelling studies                
              to determine the dynamical and microphysical factors that are                  
              important in determining the timing and location of heavy                      
              snowfalls.  If successful, this research may lead to better                    
              forecast of these disruptive events.
