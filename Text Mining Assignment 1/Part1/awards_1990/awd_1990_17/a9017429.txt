Abstract    :
              A Renewal of support is sought for research on proton glasses, in              
              which one will examine the effects of cation and anion substitution            
              and of deuteration.  The experiments will be carried out in the                
              temperature range 3K to 450K, at hydrostatic pressures up to 4kbar             
              and at higher pressures using opposed-anvil cells.  Field-cooling              
              experiments will be conducted in a search for the onset of non-                
              ergodicity, and non-linear effects will be studied by means of 3rd-            
              order dielectric susceptibility measurements.
