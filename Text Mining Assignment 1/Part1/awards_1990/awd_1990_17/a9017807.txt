Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Marine snow is ubiquitous and abundant in coastal waters, sinks                
              faster than its constituent particles, and is similar in                       
              composition to the flocculent layer of the benthos.  An initial                
              study suggests that meiofauna and competent larvae of benthic                  
              macrofauna, when in the water column, are associated with marine               
              snow.  This project will build on the initial study by testing                 
              the following hypotheses:  1) The association between benthic                  
              meiofauna/larvae and marine snow is dependent on the pelagic                   
              abundance, composition and developmental stage of                              
              meiofauna/larvae, the time of day, and height of the bottom.  2)               
              Benthic meiofauna/larvae actively enter marine snow upon contact.              
              3) Meiofauna/larvae affect the formation and breakdown of marine               
              snow.  This research will contribute to our understanding of the               
              biology and adaptive value of the planktonic existence of benthic              
              organisms, processes affecting sinking and deposition of these                 
              organisms, and benthic-pelagic exchange.
