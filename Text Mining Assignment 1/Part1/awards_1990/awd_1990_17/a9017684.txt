Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              The investigator proposes to use FTNMR to probe the                            
              anisotropy of the intermolecular potential. Because                            
              previous work in this field has been restricted to certain                     
              conditions, the PI is interested in extending the range                        
              for the cross sections above 400 K so as to obtain more                        
              information about the energetic region high on the                             
              repulsive wall of the intermolecular potential as well as                      
              to extend the lower limit into the condensed phase.  In                        
              conjunction with the condensed phase work, the PI proposes                     
              to carry out dynamic simulations in order to model the                         
              results since, by using dynamic calculations it is                             
              possible to change various physical parameters while                           
              keeping the potential function the same.
