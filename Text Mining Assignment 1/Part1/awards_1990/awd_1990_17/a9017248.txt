Abstract    :
                   The intent of this proposal is to continue basic studies on               
              the cross sections and branching ratios of atomic photoionization              
              using synchrotron radiation. The proposed work extends previous                
              work in two directions:                                                        
                   (a) Measurements will be made on open shell atoms and high Z              
              atoms over an extended range of photon energies.                               
                   (b) Detailed studies will be made of near threshold double                
              photoionization in order to provide data for comparison with                   
              theory.
