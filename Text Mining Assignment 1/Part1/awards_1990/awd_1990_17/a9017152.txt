Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A remarkable variety of organisms inhabit the Earth.  Regardless               
              of their phylogenetic position, their survival depends on their                
              capacity to adapt to their changing environments.  Environmental               
              pathogens are a part of that changing milieu.  All animals and many            
              plants display cell surface glycoproteins that serve in                        
              discrimination of self from non-self molecules.  This appears to               
              be a fundamental aspect of living cells and organisms.  In addition            
              to the ability to discriminate "self" from "foreign", organisms                
              must possess protective mechanisms to contend with the plethora of             
              potential pathogens and parasites in their environments.  These                
              defense responses may involve contact or short-range cell-cell                 
              interactions, or the synthesis and secretion of defensive molecules            
              with agglutinating or lytic properties.  The International Society             
              of Developmental and Comparative Immunologists (ISDCI), which meets            
              triennially as a Congress, is the only international organization              
              of investigators dedicated to the study of defense mechanisms in               
              the diversity of organisms in the greatly disparate phylogenetic               
              groups inhabiting this planet.   This proposal seeks support for               
              the Vth International Congress of this society which will be held              
              August 4-9, 1991 at Reed College in Portland, Oregon.  The exchange            
              of ideas and data at this international meeting will contribute                
              greatly to the advancement of knowledge in this important area.
