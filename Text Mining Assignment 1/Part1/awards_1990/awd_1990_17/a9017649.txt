Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Professor Jiri Jonas is supported by a grant from the                          
              Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to study the                   
              dynamic structure of liquids using NMR spectroscopy and                        
              Rayleigh and Raman scattering.  The primary importance of this                 
              research is in furthering our understanding of the effects                     
              which pressure, temperature and nature of the solvent have on                  
              chemical structure and reactivity.                                             
                                                                                             
              Jonas plans to use NMR spectroscopy and laser Rayleigh and                     
              Raman scattering techniques to study molecular motions,                        
              intermolecular interactions and reaction rates in various                      
              liquid systems.  Properties such as self-diffusion                             
              coefficients, shear viscosities and densities will also be                     
              measured.  The use of pressure as an experimental variable                     
              represents the important feature of the experiments to be                      
              conducted because this approach enables Jonas to separate the                  
              effects of density and temperature on dynamic processes in                     
              liquids.  The main emphasis will be on the use of high                         
              resolution multinuclear FT NMR techniques at high pressures to                 
              study: 1) dynamical solvent effects on reaction rates; 2)                      
              dynamics of complex liquids;  3) applicability of hydrodynamic                 
              equations at the molecular level; and 4) chemical shift studies                
              of hydrogen bonded liquids.  Laser Raman scattering studies                    
              will concentrate on: 1) collision induced scattering in binary                 
              liquid mixtures; and 2) frequency non-coincidence effects in                   
              polar liquids.
