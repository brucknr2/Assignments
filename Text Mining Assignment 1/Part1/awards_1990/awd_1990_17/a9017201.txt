Abstract    :
                   This award supports the development of an empirical mid- to               
              low-latitude meridional wind model. Current neutral wind models                
              are not precise enough for ionospheric density and temperature                 
              modeling. Apart from its intrinsic usefulness to ionospheric                   
              modelers, an improved neutral wind model will provide a useful                 
              bench mark for the thermospheric general circulation models.
