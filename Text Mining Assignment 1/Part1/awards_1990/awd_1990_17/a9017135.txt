Abstract    :
              Field work in the last decade has led to the discovery of Plio-                
              Quaternary eruptions of potassium- and water-rich basic lavas in               
              the fore-arc region of the western Mexican Volcanic belt (Fig.                 
              (Fig. 2), contemporary with the main calc-alkaline andesitic                   
              central volcanoes.  The association of this volcanism with                     
              rifting, both within and at the margin of the Jalisco block                    
              (Fig. 2), may have general implications for the magmatic and                   
              tectonic regimes along a continental convergent margin.  This                  
              project will investigate the relationships between tectonism,                  
              distribution of volcanic centers, magma output rates, and                      
              compositional diversity in order to gain a better understanding                
              of the extent and scale of the heterogeneity of magma source                   
              regions, as well as the factors which influence the ascent and                 
              eruption of magma.  The proposed field work will focus on                      
              volcanism in a 50,000 km2 region in central Mexico, particularly               
              the Valley of Mexico.  This region contains over 400 monogenetic               
              cones, flows, and other eruptive centers about which little is                 
              known.  A comprehensive study of the temporal and spatial                      
              distribution of this volcanism is a crucial constraint on models               
              of magma genesis and diversification.  This region is also one                 
              of the most densely populated in Mexico so that the assessment of              
              volcanic hazards, which the P.I.s will conduct in collaboration                
              with Mexican scientists at UNAM, will contribute to its                        
              significance.
