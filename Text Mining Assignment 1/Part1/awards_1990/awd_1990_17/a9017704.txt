Abstract    :
              The photochemical reaction center complex known as Photosystem                 
              I is characterized by the presence of bound iron-sulfur centers                
              that function as electron acceptors.  Preparations of the                      
              photochemically active native Photosystem I complex contains                   
              at least one dozen subunits, most of which have no well                        
              established function.  The overall objective of this project                   
              is to define the function of these subunits and to determine                   
              their structural organization.  The major experimental                         
              techniques will be those of biochemical resolution and                         
              reconstitution and these methods will be supplemented with                     
              biophysical measurements to monitor the functional state of                    
              many of the electron carriers.  In addition to characterizing                  
              this complex, the project will also consider the structural                    
              organization of polypeptide subunits in a reaction center                      
              complex isolated from anaerobic photosynthetic bacteria known                  
              as green sulfur bacteria since there is compelling biophysical                 
              evidence that indicates this complex has functional components                 
              that are similar to those in the plant-type Photosystem I                      
              complex.  Results from this project will aid in defining the                   
              mechanism of photoinduced electron transfer in a photochemical                 
              reaction center complex and will provide information on the                    
              evolution of the photosynthetic reaction center complex from                   
              primitive to more advanced systems.
