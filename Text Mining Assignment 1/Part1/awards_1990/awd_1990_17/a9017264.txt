Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              When tissue gafts are transplanted from one species of mollusc to              
              another (xenografts), the grafts reportedly fail, i.e., die.  The              
              goal of the proposed research is to understand the mechanisms of               
              xenograft failure in molluscs.  Specifically, the study will assess            
              the relative roles of (1) physiological incompatibility between                
              donor and recipient and (2) immunological rejection by the                     
              recipient.  Methods will include implantation of hearts from                   
              phylogenetically close and phylogenetically distant species into               
              a single recipient snail species.  Fates of the implants will be               
              followed histologically and histochemically, and will be compared              
              to fates of hearts maintained in vitro, and to fates of implants               
              from donors of the same species.  In addition, the role of the                 
              immune system will be ascertained by conducting implants in                    
              immunosuppressed recipients, i.e., snails infected with larval                 
              trematodes.  Finally, initial information on the types of                      
              determinants on the xenograft recognized as non-self will be gained            
              by subjecting grafts to chemical modification such as neuraminidase            
              digestion and lectin binding prior to implantation.                            
                                                                                             
              The potential significance of this project is that it may help to              
              elucidate the mechanisms of immune-like self recognition in                    
              molluscs, serve as a model for studying primitive forms of self                
              recognition that also occur in vertebrates, and provide information            
              on phylogenetic relationships within an important group of                     
              molluscs.
