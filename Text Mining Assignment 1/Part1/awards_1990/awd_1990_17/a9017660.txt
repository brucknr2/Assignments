Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Saline and dilute groundwaters of distinct origin converge and                 
              mix in two juxtaposed Paleozoic aquifers in Missouri and Kansas.               
              Research is proposed that will investigate the processes that                  
              control the flow history and geochemical evolution of                          
              groundwaters in this large-scale flow system.  Processes to be                 
              examined include gravity-driven flow, fluid mixing and water-rock              
              interaction.  This examination will be accomplished through the                
              analysis of the waters for a range of chemical and isotopic                    
              systems, including major and trace element concentrations, H, O,               
              Sr, Nd, B, U, Th, Pb and Ra isotope compositions, and rare earth               
              element concentrations.  Models for the evolution of the                       
              groundwaters will be evaluated using quantitative models that                  
              simulate chemical and isotopic exchange during the migration of                
              subsurface fluids.  The models developed for this flow system are              
              expected to have significant implications for a variety of                     
              geologic and environmental issues, such as the origin of basinal               
              brines and Pb-Zn ore deposits, the transport of radionuclides,                 
              trace metals and hydrocarbons in the Earth's crust, the                        
              diagenesis of sediments and the management of water resources.
