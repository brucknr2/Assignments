Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will study the origin of alkaline                   
              ring-dike complexes, and in particular the relationship between                
              coexisting silica-undersaturated and silica-saturated syenites.                
              Attention will be focused on the Red hill complex in New                       
              Hampshire, specifically on the mineral apatite, which as one of                
              the first phases to crystallize most likely preserves information              
              about the early history of these rocks.  The relationship between              
              rare earth element compositions of apatite in mafic enclaves to                
              those in host syenites will be used as the primary investigative               
              technique.  The research will determine whether this approach is               
              a useful one in establishing consanguinity between the enclaves                
              and the host rocks, and may provide an important tool in                       
              investigating  the very early stages of liquid descent in such                 
              rocks.
