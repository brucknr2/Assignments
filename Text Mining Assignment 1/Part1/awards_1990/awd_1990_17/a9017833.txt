Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                     The goal of ths research is to use nobel gases to constrain            
              thenature and origin of mantle heterogeneities. The controversy                
              regarding the extent to which helium isotopes are decoupled from               
              the other isotopic tracers by magma chamber proceses will be                   
              tested by measurements of He/(Th+U) ratios and by measurements of              
              He,Sr,Nd, and Pb isotopes in the same samples. The research will               
              help constrain the origin of the variability on different time                 
              and length scales, and also resolve some of the controversy                    
              regarding the interpretation of low 3He/4He ratios in oceanic                  
              rocks. New measurements will be made on samples from ocean                     
              islands and ridges that are geologically well constrained.
