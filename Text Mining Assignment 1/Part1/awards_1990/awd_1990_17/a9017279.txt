Abstract    :
                   A single investigator and undergraduates will participate                 
              in a collaborative effort at Fermilab (Experiment 687) to study                
              the production of particles containing heavy quarks (c-quarks                  
              and b-quarks) by photons incident on various targets.  A new                   
              detector facility, just brought into operation, will be used.                  
              The data obtained will be used to verify the predictions of                    
              theoretical models, to obtain production cross sections, to                    
              measure lifetime and branching fractions of particles                          
              containing the c-quark.  The grant is awarded under the                        
              Research at Undergraduate Institutions program and involves                    
              undergraduates in forefront research.  In particular, there                    
              will be substantial undergraduate experience with of fast                      
              computing and mass data storage.
