Abstract    :
              This research program plans to study the linear and nonlinear                  
              dynamics and elastic properties of low dimensional conductors                  
              supporting charge density wave (CDW) and spin density wave (SDW)               
              condensates.  The CDW systems include, among others nyobium                    
              selenides and sulfides, tantalum sulfide, and several alkali                   
              molybdates, while the SDW systems include chromium, uranium-                   
              ruthenium silicide and a one-dimensional organic chain.  A variety             
              of electrical conductivity and noise measurements will be performed            
              over a wide range of frequency, magnetic field, pressure, and                  
              sample spatial extent to determine the internal mode dynamics,                 
              metastable state structure, and the role of electron-electron                  
              correlations.  The properties of the dynamic SPW condensates will              
              be explored.  Elastic measurements of CDW or SDW materials in the              
              presence of ac + dc electric fields and other perturbations will               
              help establish internal mode deformations and lattice couplings.               
              Nonlinear dynamics (chaos) studies will help reveal the number of              
              active degrees of freedom in CDW transport and the role of                     
              amplitude dynamics.
