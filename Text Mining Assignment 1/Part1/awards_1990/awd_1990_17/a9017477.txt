Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              In this project, the investigator proposes to:                                 
                                                                                             
              1. Develop a protocol for computational mechanics                              
                 methodology which enhances solution accuracy with                           
                 reasonable resource demand, that will be appropriate                        
                 for the computation of thermo, solid and fluid                              
                 dynamical systems.                                                          
                                                                                             
              2. Integrate the protocols into one smooth solution                            
                 algorithm.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              3. Apply this new protocol in the solution of the flow                         
                 between rotating coaxial cylinders; and                                     
                                                                                             
              4. Investigate the potential generalization of the method                      
                 to specific combinations of coupled thermo, solid and                       
                 fluid dynamical problems.                                                   
                                                                                             
              Solving models that combine these three areas:  thermo,                        
              solid and fluid dynamics is a very critical problem in                         
              engineering technology.  Reasonably good computational                         
              protocols are available to handle the above systems                            
              independently, but hardly any efficient technique has yet                      
              been developed to integrate the simultaneous solution of                       
              the three problem types.
