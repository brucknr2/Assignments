Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This study addresses the poorly known controls on the                     
              exchange of sediment between the shoreface and inner                           
              continental shelf under varying fair-and storm-weather                         
              conditions. The overall goal is to evaluate more complex                       
              interactions between waves, currents, suspended load and                       
              bedform characterisics to improve the understanding of                         
              shoreface erosion and accretion. Observations will be gathered                 
              from tripod-based flow meters, suspended sediment sensors and                  
              altimeters deployed at several sites from Virginia to Long                     
              Island. Measurements will be used to evaluate theoretical                      
              models of shoreface response and equilibrium adjustment. This                  
              information will be used to modify physical models.
