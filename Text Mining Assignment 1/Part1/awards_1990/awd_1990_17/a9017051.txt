Abstract    :
                   This award will provide partial support for the conference                
              Computations in Natural and Artificial Parallel Systems.  This                 
              conference is interdisciplinary in nature, bringing together                   
              researchers from several different fields to focus on parallel                 
              computation systems, comparing the parallel circuit in the brain               
              with that of parallel computer systems.  The conference with be                
              held September 27-30 at the Beckman Institute in Urbana-Champaign,             
              Illinois.
