Abstract    :
              The photosynthetic bacteria are amongst the most versatile of                  
              photosynthetic organisms, in terms of the habitats in which they               
              thrive, the diversity of their physiological processes and in                  
              aspects of their biochemistry.  The VIIth International Symposium              
              on Photosynthetic Prokaryotes (the first such to be held in the                
              USA) will bring together scholars from around the globe to assess              
              recent progress in understanding the bioconversion of radiant                  
              energy (light) into that of the chemical bond energy found in the              
              biomass of these organisms.                                                    
                                                                                             
              Partial financial support of the VIIth International Symposium on              
              Photosynthetic Prokaryotes will make it possible for young US                  
              scientists to take part in this conference.  Recent progress in                
              the events involved in harvesting the energy of light by                       
              converting it into more biologically useful forms, in the form of              
              cellular compounds, will be the focus of the symposium.
