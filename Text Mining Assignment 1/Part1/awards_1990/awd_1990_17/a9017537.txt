Abstract    :
              This is a proposal for funds to acquire two                                    
              ultracentrifuges and rotors for use by four of the seven                       
              laboratories at the Carnegie Institution of Washington,                        
              Department of Plant Biology, which are involved in research in                 
              molecular biology, biochemistry, and physiology.  Projects                     
              include understanding how proteins are sorted to and within the                
              chloroplast, how cells perceive and respond to nutrient                        
              deprivation, how photosynthetic cells alter their light                        
              harvesting apparatus in response to changes in light quality, how              
              red and blue light effects photomorphogenic changes, how light                 
              affects ionic fluxes, and how photosynthetic and respiratory                   
              metabolism is regulated.  In these four laboratories the                       
              centrifuge is the most heavily used piece of equipment.  Most                  
              experiments require the use of ultracentrifuges.
