Abstract    :
                   This group will carry out a broad based research program                  
              in theoretical nuclear physics.  Among the topics to be worked                 
              on are quantization of collective motion, relativistic                         
              transport equations, collective flow in heavy-ion collisions,                  
              two-proton interferometry, deuteron production in heavy-ion,                   
              simulations of ultra relativistic collisions, large basis shell                
              model calculations, and the structure of exotic neutron rich                   
              nuclei.
