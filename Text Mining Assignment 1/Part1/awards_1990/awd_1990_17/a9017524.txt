Abstract    :
              This grant will allow the School of Engineering and Technology at              
              Tennessee State University to develop and implement a five year                
              strategic plan.  The plan will guide the School of Engineering and             
              Technology towards a paradigm shift in the quality of its programs,            
              resulting in an increase in the quanitity and quaility of engineering          
              graduates from both the undergraduate and graduate programs.  The              
              strategic plan will receive direct input from private industry and             
              government on the local, state and national level.  Representatives            
              will come together at a Commitment Conference where various funding            
              strategies will be coordinated.  The result will be an active,                 
              comprehensive action plan supported by the private and public sector           
              that will enhance the efforts of the School of Engineering and                 
              Technology towards academic excellence.
