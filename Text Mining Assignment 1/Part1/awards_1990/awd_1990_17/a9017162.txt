Abstract    :
              This award supports an international workshop on progress in                   
              catalyst preparation to be held in Mar del Plata, Argentina,                   
              during the 7th through the 10th of October, 1991, with the                     
              participation of eight scientists from the U. S. and nine                      
              from Argentina.  The workshop will cover the following three                   
              topics:  1) catalyst precursors and their method of addition,                  
              such as impregnation, precipitation, and ion exchange, 2)                      
              activation treatments, such as calcination, oxidation, and                     
              reduction, 3) modification of catalytic properties, such as                    
              surface modification by ion exchange, and bulk modification                    
              by metal substitution or complex inclusion.  The workshop                      
              will be restricted to the types of catalysts extensively                       
              investigated in both countries, to favor discussion and                        
              further cooperation.  Thus, the workshop will be mainly                        
              dedicated to supported metal and metal oxide catalysts, and                    
              modified molecular sieves and layered structures.  Emphasis                    
              will be placed on the characterization of the preparation                      
              and  modification steps and their influence upon catalytic                     
              properties.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              Recently a rapidly widening number of American researchers is                  
              becoming involved in this area.  In Argentina the situation                    
              is  similar where the school of catalysis is of American and                   
              European origin, and the Argentine work in catalyst preparation                
              is significant.  This workshop by bringing together scientists                 
              from Argentina and the U.S. will lead to further collaboration                 
              in catalysis which will increase productive output and                         
              benefit research in both countries.
