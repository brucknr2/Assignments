Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A new experimental micromechanics measurement technique is                     
              explored to permit accurate measurements of deformations and                   
              strains to a region of 0.1 microns.  A scanning electron                       
              microscope is used to burn an array of dots on a metallic                      
              coating deposited on the specimen.  Grid distortions after                     
              mechanical loading give a topographic map of the strain field.                 
              Eventually it is desired to extend the technique to domain sizes               
              of about 0.01 microns.  The properties of interfaces are                       
              considered in this project with the aim of applying this refined               
              technique to understanding the stress state of interfaces.
