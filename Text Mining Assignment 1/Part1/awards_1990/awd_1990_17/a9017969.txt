Abstract    :
              This award is an accomplishment-based renewal of an ongoing study              
              of the katabatic winds in East Antarctica, in cooperation with                 
              French and Australian scientists.  It depends on surface                       
              meteorological data derived from two lines of automatic weather                
              stations; one from Dome C to the antarctic coast, the other along              
              the coast from Commonwealth Bay to Dumont d'Urville.  Three new                
              stations will be installed, which will connect this network with               
              that maintained by the Australian Antarctic program.  These new                
              stations will have the capability of providing heat flux data in               
              addition to the standard observations.  The expanded coverage will             
              allow an examination of the influence of synoptic weather systems              
              on the katabatic winds, as well provide information on the spatial             
              variability of individual wind speed maxima.  Additionally,                    
              improvements in the calibration of the instrument to measure                   
              blowing snow will be introduced, and the formation and heat budget             
              of offshore polynyas resulting from katabatic winds will be                    
              studied.
