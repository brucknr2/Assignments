Abstract    :
                   The objective of this research is to investigate the                      
              statistical properties of various process capability indices.                  
              These indices are used in many industrial settings to determine the            
              quality of product received from suppliers as well as the                      
              effectiveness of competing vendors.  The development of new                    
              methodologies for assessing process capability without making any              
              distributional assumptions is also part of this research effort.               
                   Research will address both significant scientific and                     
              practical issues in the area of statistical quality control.                   
              Results should produce an impact on academia and industrial                    
              communities.
