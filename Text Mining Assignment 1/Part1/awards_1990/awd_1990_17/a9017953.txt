Abstract    :
                   The PIs propose to develop a 2 course sequence on high                    
              performance scientific computing for undergraduate students, together          
              with a laboratory to support these courses.  They will develop text            
              books, manuals, and software for both courses and laboratory exercises         
              and will attempt to disseminate these materials to other institutions          
              via summer workshops.  Five institutions have agreed to collaborate            
              with Colorado and to offer similar courses to their own students.              
              Laboratory facilities will include high speed workstations, graphics           
              workstations, and an INTEL iPSC.  Remote ascess to a Cray Y-MP will            
              also be provided.                                                              
                                                                                             
                   This proposal has the potential to produce badly needed                   
              computational scientists to address the national needs in high                 
              performance computing.
