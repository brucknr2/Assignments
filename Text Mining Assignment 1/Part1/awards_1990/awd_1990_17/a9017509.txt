Abstract    :
              Measurements of acoustic wave propagation beneath the seafloor                 
              provide critical data for understanding the physical properties                
              of marine sediments and crustal rock. Such information can be                  
              used to examine the composition and alteration of such material.               
              Historically, most studies investigating the acoustic properties               
              have used either seismic or laboratory techniques. Although                    
              useful, such data is often inaccurate for extrapolating to                     
              significant depth in the sea-floor. With the advent of sonic                   
              logging in the Ocean Drilling Program, some high-resolution                    
              acoustic data has become available. Because of the complexity of               
              lithology, structure, geometry and available equipment, most                   
              measurements have only been able to determine compressional wave               
              variations.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              The present project would adapt and modify for use on the JOIDES               
              Resolution available industry equipment for measuring shear wave               
              velocities and waveforms. This in situ data can be combined with               
              routinely measured compressional velocities to completely                      
              characterize the acoustic properties of drilled sediments. The                 
              principal investigator is a promising young scientist who is                   
              fully qualified to undertake the proposed project. This award                  
              represents his first NSF research support.
