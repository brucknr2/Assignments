Abstract    :
              This proposal focuses on two aspects of probabilistic methods in the           
              design and analysis of algorithms:  the construction of randomized             
              algorithms, which toss coins in the course of their execution; and the         
              probabilistic analysis of algorithms, on the assumption that their             
              input data is drawn from a specified probability distribution.                 
              In the area of randomized algorithms, this study will concentrate on           
              four topics:  competitive analysis of randomized on-line algorithms,           
              randomized algorithms for enumeration problems, randomized scheduling          
              of parallel computations and randomness as a computational resource.           
              In the area of probabilistic analysis, this study will emphasize the           
              analysis of fast and simple algorithms for the approximate solution of         
              combinatorial optimization problems.
