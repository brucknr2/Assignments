Abstract    :
              This award will support the distribution, use, and extension of a              
              new neural network simulation tool, referred to as GENESIS                     
              (General NEural SImulation System).  GENESIS has been developed                
              by the principal investigator to build realistic models of                     
              biological neural systems.  The large interest in using                        
              simulations to studying the nervous system also makes it more                  
              important that the system be supported, enhanced and extended.                 
              One approach to this support is the design of GENESIS based                    
              tutorials that both demonstrate the use of the simulation system               
              and, at the same time, provide educational tools for                           
              understanding how neural simulations are structured and                        
              constructed.  This is an important aspect of the current award.                
              From a technical point of view, because GENESIS makes use of                   
              state of the art approaches to computer simulation platforms and               
              graphics interfaces, further software development will provide                 
              exciting opportunities for expansion of the systems capabilities.              
              This award will support the porting of the software system to                  
              parallel computers which have the potential to provide                         
              significant increases in the computing power for simulations.                  
              This award will also support the development of broadly based                  
              GENESIS users group communicating over computer networks.  With                
              this capability, researchers will be able to interact even in                  
              real-time while developing simulations and associated tools.                   
              Taken together, this award will provide the support necessary for              
              the distribution and extension of a valuable tool for                          
              computational neurobiology.  It will support general education in              
              the use of simulation techniques as well as the development of                 
              communication between different research groups interested in                  
              computational approaches to understanding the nervous system.
