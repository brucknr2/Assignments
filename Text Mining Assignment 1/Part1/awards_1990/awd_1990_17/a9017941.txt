Abstract    :
                   This proposal seeks to establish a Digital Design Center at North         
              Carolina State University to support the teaching of digital design to         
              undergraduate students.  The cooperation of industry will be sought            
              both to provide real design projects and to help fund the Center.  The         
              proposal requests funds to purchase workstations, software and XILINX          
              logic boards as well as faculty support to develop laboratory and              
              course materials.  Workshops and other means of dissemination will be          
              used to allow other institutions to replicate the Center elsewhere.
