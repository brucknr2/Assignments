Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will analyze the hyperbolic                    
              behavior of finite systems of interacting problems. Specifically,              
              he will investigate the ergodic theory or long term behavior of a              
              system of n particles in a line subject to an appropriate                      
              external force. The project will also investigate diffusion                    
              around a particular stable solution of the dynamical system. The               
              research considers a special case of a problem, the n-body                     
              problem, which has resisted complete solution since Newton.
