Abstract    :
                   There are three variations of the maple sugaring process, all             
              of which return to the use of the basic open pan system. This                  
              system has been returned to repeatedly throughout history. However,            
              this system has not proved to be energy efficient and/or sanitary              
              and it is extremely time consuming.                                            
              %%%                                                                            
                   The objective of the proposed research is to modernize the                
              present Maple Syrup process. The goal of the proposed system is to             
              become energy efficient. The impact of this system will overtake               
              the sugaring industry; the cost of producing Maple Syrup would                 
              drastically be reduced. Through preliminary calculations the cost              
              per gallon of Maple Syrup would be 55 percent less than the present            
              day costs.
