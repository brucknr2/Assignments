Abstract    :
              The research, in the general area of Analytical and Surface                    
              Chemistry, focuses on developing an understanding of the                       
              fundamental aspects and capabilities of the scanning tunneling                 
              microscope.  The work promises to exploit important new                        
              applications for this powerful instrument capable of obtaining                 
              striking images of individual atoms and molecules.                             
                                                                                             
              An extremely stable ultra-high vacuum scanning tunneling                       
              microscope operating at 4K, equipped with a wide range of                      
              surface science facilities, will be used to try to study the                   
              vibrational spectra of single molecules adsorbed on solid                      
              surfaces using inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy.  A                   
              second instrument, designed to operate over a temperature range                
              of 4K to 150K, will be used to study site-to-site hopping rates                
              of thermally activated diffusion of adsorbates.   These studies                
              promise to provide some of the best atomic and molecular                       
              pictures available, provide a unique combination with existing                 
              surface science methods, lead to an understanding of the                       
              bonding of molecules at specific surface sites, and enhance our                
              understanding of surface diffusion.
