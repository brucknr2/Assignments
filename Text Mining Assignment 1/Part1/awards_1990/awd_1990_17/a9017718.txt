Abstract    :
              Available data show that the anorthositic rocks of the Nain                    
              Plutonic Suite carry Sr and Nd isotopic enrichments, which are                 
              due either to crustal assimilation or to derivation of parent                  
              magmas from enriched mantle sources.  These conflicting                        
              hypotheses can be tested by rare-earth element (REE) and Sr, Nd                
              and Pb isotopic studies of available samples from country rocks                
              and contact zones of the plutonic suite, as well as better                     
              characterization of the interiors of plutons.  Combined with new               
              Pb isotopic data from the Kiglapait Intrusion, the studies will                
              furnish a definitive test of contamination versus source                       
              enrichment.  Tectonic and thermal history of the region before,                
              during, and after the anorthosite episode will also be                         
              illuminated by comprehensive study of mineral closure ages by the              
              argon-argon method.
