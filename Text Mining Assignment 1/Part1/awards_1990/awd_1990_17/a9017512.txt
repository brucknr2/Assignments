Abstract    :
              This project will involve a detailed mineralogical and chemical                
              analysis of the clay minerals in numerous long sediment-cores (up              
              to 12m in length) which have been collected recently from Lake                 
              Malawi and Lake Turkana in East Africa.  By analyzing carefully                
              the vertical changes in the clay assemblages and correlating                   
              these with changes in diatom contents, physical stratigraphy and               
              interstitial-water chemistry, we will a) document the timing and               
              degree of paleosalinity fluctuations of these lakes during the                 
              last several thousand years and b) examine the detailed processes              
              of clay-mineral diagenesis in alkaline lakes, especially the                   
              uptake of Mg in smectite phases and the transformation of                      
              smectite into illite under variable chemical conditions.  The                  
              data will be correlated with other proxy climatic indicators from              
              these lake basins and with previous studies elsewhere in East                  
              Africa to help document patterns of global climate change in the               
              Holocene.  Furthermore, since both rift-valleys and alkaline                   
              lakes are now recognized as important depositional environments                
              in the geological record, an understanding of the behavior of                  
              clay minerals in these modern settings will help evaluate the                  
              role of burial diagenetic reactions for the generation and                     
              migration of petroleum in non-marine settings.
