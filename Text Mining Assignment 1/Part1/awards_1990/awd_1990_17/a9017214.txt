Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research explores the strengthening and toughening of                     
              intermetallic alloys by introduction of dispersed phases.  These               
              materials are technologically important because of their                       
              potential as advanced high temperature materials; the key is to                
              improve their low temperature ductility and toughness.  This                   
              study focusses on transformation toughening in two-phase gamma                 
              titanium aluminide with approximately 10 volume percent beta                   
              phase.  The goal is to determine compositions which provide crack              
              tip toughening due to martensite phase transformation induced by               
              the deformation at the crack front.  Experiments are planned                   
              involving the measurement of compressive flow stress, indentation              
              hardness, and fracture toughness.  Microstructural and                         
              fractographic analysis complete the characterization of the                    
              specimens.
