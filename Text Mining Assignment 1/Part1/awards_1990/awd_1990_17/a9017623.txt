Abstract    :
                 This project has two primary objectives designed to increase our            
              understanding of the replication of a plant rhabdovirus, sonchus               
              yellow net virus (SYNV).  These objectives are:  to continue                   
              ongoing studies of SYNV replication in infected tobacco                        
              protoplasts; and to develop an in vitro system for investigating               
              transcription and replication of the SYNV genome.  The protoplast              
              experiments will contribute to a more detailed understanding of                
              events occurring during the replication cycle of the virus and will            
              permit analysis of the roles the host may play in this process.                
              The in vitro system will yeild information relevant to the                     
              regulation of transcription, replication and encapsidation of the              
              SYNV genome products.                                                          
                                                                                             
              Thus, this project will provide information of broad biological                
              significance for understanding the life cycles of negative strand              
              viruses and applications of their gene products for therapeutic                
              purposes.
