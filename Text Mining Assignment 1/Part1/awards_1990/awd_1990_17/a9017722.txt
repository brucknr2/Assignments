Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Cytoplasmic hemoglobins characteristic of nearly all bivalves and              
              gastropod molluscs in which chemoautotrophic bacteria are present              
              as internal symbionts appear vital to the symbiosis.  Three such               
              hemoglobins, from gills of the clam Lucina,  have been isolated                
              and their interactions with either sulfide or oxygen determined.               
              The role(s) of these hemoglobins in the symbiotic association will             
              now be examined using broken-cell systems containing symbiotic                 
              bacteria, kpurified gill hemoglobins, sulfide, and oxygen.  The                
              molecular mechanisms of cytoplasmic hemoglobin-mediated oxygen                 
              delivery and sulfide delivery to the bacterial symbionts will be               
              studied; the effects of reduction of either heme or the ligand on              
              ligand dissociation will be examined.  Our understanding of the                
              means whereby the bacteria utilize carbon dioxide using energy                 
              gained from sulfide oxidation, thus supporting life of this clam               
              and other similar macrobes should be enhanced by these studies.                
                                                                                             
              The particular roles and mechanisms whereby hemoglobins, present               
              in the cytoplasm of certain marine invertebrates in which an                   
              unusual symbiosis involving internalized chemoautotrophic bacteria             
              exists, will be studied in terms of the ability of the                         
              invertebrate's hemoglobins to transport oxygen and sulfide to the              
              bacteria.  This inter-dependence of micro- and the macro-organism              
              is an increasingly recognized one; an understanding of the means               
              whereby sulfide, toxic to the invertebrate, reaches the symbiont               
              and is protected from oxygen should be enlarged by this study.  //
