Abstract    :
                   An electron calorimeter will be constructed for use in a                  
              new generation measurement of the muon anomalous magnetic                      
              moment.  The detector will be used in conjunction with a large                 
              muon storage ring being built at Brookhaven National                           
              Laboratory, where the experiment will be conducted.  A twenty-                 
              fold increase in sensitivity over previous measurements is                     
              anticipated, providing improved understanding of electroweak                   
              renormalization effects and muon substructure to an equivalent                 
              mass of several teV.
