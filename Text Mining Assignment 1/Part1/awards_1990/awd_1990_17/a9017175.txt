Abstract    :
                   The conferences on Stochastic Processes and their Applications            
              have become the principal annual forum for scientists studying                 
              stochastic processes and their applications.  The twentieth meeting            
              will be held in June, 1991 in Israel, under the auspices of the                
              Bernoulli Society for Mathematical Statistics and Probability.                 
              This grant will partially support about eight US invited speakers              
              and ten young researchers, including graduate students.  The                   
              atmosphere of this conference series has been very conducive to                
              interaction between new researchers and established senior                     
              scientists.  Participation in this conference should have a                    
              significant, positive impact on the development of research                    
              careers.
