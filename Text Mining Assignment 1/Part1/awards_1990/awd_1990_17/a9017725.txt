Abstract    :
                   The way the magnetic field of the earth connects with the                 
              interplanetary magnetic field is an interesting and important                  
              problem for understanding the near-earth space environment.                    
              Field lines from the polar cap do not close at the opposite pole               
              of the earth when they emanate from higher magnetic latitudes                  
              than a boundary called the separatrix, but rather connect with                 
              the interplanetary field.  Flow of mass and energy across this                 
              boundary gives mass and evergy flow between open and closed field              
              lines, and drives the majority of magnetospheric processes.  The               
              energy involved comes almost entirely from the solar wind.  This               
              projects seeks to initiate a large-scale study of an important                 
              related phenomenon called the magetospheric reconnection rate                  
              under a variety of geophysical conditions using ionospheric                    
              observations from the Sonderstrom incoherent scatter radar.  The               
              investigators have developed a technique that shows great promise              
              of allowing the measurement of plasma flow across the separatrix,              
              and from this flow to determine the reconnection rate.
