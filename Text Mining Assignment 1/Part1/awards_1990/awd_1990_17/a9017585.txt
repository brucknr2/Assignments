Abstract    :
                   Theoretical research in elementary particle physics and                   
              quantum field theory will focus on predicting the higher -order                
              effects of the weak interaction, and on the question of why                    
              quarks and gluons are always confined within larger particles.                 
              New experimental facilities at the European Laboratory for                     
              Particle Physics (CERN), the Fermi National Accelerator                        
              Laboratory, and the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, have                   
              made possible incisive tests of our theory of the weak                         
              interaction which center on the higher - order effects                         
              predicted by this theory.  These tests are a major thrust of                   
              current efforts in particle physics.  The question of why                      
              quarks and gluons are confined is a long - standing one which                  
              is difficult to answer because it concerns phenomena in which                  
              the strong nuclear force cannot be treated as a small                          
              perturbation.  Progress on the answer to this question is                      
              important if we are to fully comprehend the strong force.
