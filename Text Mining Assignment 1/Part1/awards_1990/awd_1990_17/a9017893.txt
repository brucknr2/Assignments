Abstract    :
                   This work covers a wide range of problems whose solution is               
              required in order that current paradigms of melt migration                     
              (percolation, crack propagation, diapirism) can be placed on a                 
              firm foundation.  This theoretical effort is complementary to                  
              existing and expected experimental efforts and geophysical data                
              and has components of microphysics (behavior of partial melts at               
              the lengthscale of individual grains), mesophysics (behavior at                
              intermediate lengthscales) and macrophysics (behavior of                       
              geological systems, e.g., mid-ocean ridges, subduction zone                    
              volcanism, seamounts).
