Abstract    :
                   There is much interaction between numerical optimization and              
              the areas of differential equations and control.  Examples include             
              new methods for parameter identification; special purpose, mesh-               
              independent, quasi-Newton methods for discretizations of integral              
              equations, differential equations and control problems; new                    
              iterative methods for the large linear problems that are                       
              discretizations of partial differential equations; and effective               
              projection methods for inequality constrained problems from optimal            
              control.                                                                       
                   This grant will partially support a conference on these                   
              numerical optimization methods in differential equations and                   
              control, to be held at North Carolina State University in July,                
              1991.  This conference is scheduled immediately after the                      
              International Congress on Industrial and Applied Mathematics in                
              order that as many international mathematicians can attend as                  
              possible.  This will provide the US participants an opportunity to             
              keep abreast of recent advances in the area which have occurred in             
              other countries as well as their own.
