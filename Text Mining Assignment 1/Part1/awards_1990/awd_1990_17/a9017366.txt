Abstract    :
              The objective of this research is the development of new methods               
              for the controlled synthesis of macromolecules.  Specifically,                 
              attempts will be made to develop solid-state polymerization                    
              processes to yield polymers that cannot be synthesized by other                
              methods.  The work falls into four main topics.  (1) Unsaturated               
              organic monomer molecules will be clathrated in the molecular level            
              tunnel systems formed by certain crystalline solids.  The monomers             
              will then be polymerized in the tunnels by exposure to high energy             
              irradiation or by chemical initiation.  Stereospecific                         
              polymerizations are expected in some cases.  (2) Attempts will be              
              made to prepare one-dimensional metallo-backbone polymers by the               
              use of the same tunnel clathration technique.  (3) Cyclic                      
              phosphazenes which crystallize in appropriate crystal packing                  
              arrangements will be polymerized by gamma-irradiation methods.  It             
              is expected that this route will generate polymers not accessible              
              by the conventional thermal melt polymerization route.  (4) Other              
              cyclic inorganic systems that crystallize in suitable space groups             
              will also be studied by gamma-irradiation methods.  These systems              
              include heteroelement phosphazenes, boron-nitrogen-, sulfur-                   
              nitrogen-, and other heterocyclic rings.  Most of the systems to be            
              studied have proved to be resistant to conventional thermal ring-              
              opening polymerization methods.                                                
                                                                                             
              The polymers prepared in this work should have new macromolecular              
              structures and new combinations of properties that are potentially             
              useful in electronic, optical, magnetic, and other applications.
