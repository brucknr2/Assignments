Abstract    :
                   The recent discovery of fossils in the Wilhite Formation,                 
              Walden Creek Group, Ocoee Supergroup in the Blue Ridge province of             
              southern Appalachians provided evidence of Silurian or younger age             
              for the Walden Creek Group.  This result indicates that post-                  
              Tatonic successor basins extended in the Blue Ridge province from              
              Alabama to east-central Tennessee, and makes necessary revision of             
              current models of geodynamic evolution of the southern                         
              Appalachians.  At present only the older age limit for the Walden              
              CReek Group is established, and the younger age limit remains                  
              undetermined.  The objective of the proposed research is to obtain             
              more fossil material that would allow a precise determination of               
              the age of the Walden Creek Group rocks.  To this end field                    
              sampling and mapping, fossil and microfossil extraction in the                 
              laboratory, taxonomic determinations and establishment of                      
              stratigraphic biozones will be undertaken.  The significance of the            
              proposed research lies in providing time constraints on formation              
              of post-Taconic successor basins for new models of geodynamic                  
              evolution of the southern Appalachians.
