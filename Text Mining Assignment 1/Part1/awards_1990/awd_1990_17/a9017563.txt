Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The long term goal of this research is to understand the                       
              mechanisms by which ordered assemblies of biological                           
              macromolecules are formed.  These symmetrical structures are                   
              made up of molecules having specific, repeated interactions                    
              with each other.  They include both extended structures, such                  
              as cytoskeletal filaments and membrane photoreceptor arrays,                   
              and compact ones, such as nuclear pore complexes and viruses.                  
              They play crucial roles in cell morphology, motility, and other                
              areas of cell function.  The question to be investigated is:                   
              how do such ordered structures assemble themselves, i.e. how                   
              do the component molecules find their way to, recognize, and                   
              attach to specific sites?                                                      
                                                                                             
              The more immediate aim is to apply the emerging technique of                   
              atomic force microscopy to a model self-assembling system, a                   
              three-dimensional protein crystal.  Besides constituting a                     
              simple case of ordered assembly crystallization is generally                   
              the rate-limiting step in determining protein structure by                     
              X-ray diffraction.  To develop rational guidelines for                         
              optimizing crystal growth, Dr. Durbin proposes to study the                    
              fundamental process of crystallization.  Protein crystals have                 
              unique advantages for developing and applying methods of atomic                
              force microscopy to imaging biological molecules and                           
              structures.
