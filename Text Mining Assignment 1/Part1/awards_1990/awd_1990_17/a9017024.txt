Abstract    :
              Using a recently discovered effect (Laser Amplified Motion                     
              Detection and Analysis, LAMDA), this project is to develop a far-              
              field optical microscope with a resolution of 10nm.  This                      
              resolution, one-fiftieth of the wavelength of visible light and                
              about one-twentieth of the resolution obtained by previous optical             
              microscopes, would permit the imaging of detail never before                   
              realized with an optical microscope.  The LAMDA microscope would               
              be capable of making directly observable, in real time, such                   
              biological entities as DNA-protein complexes, the emergence of                 
              cell-growth factors in development, the structural details                     
              underlying mitosis, and of channel-forming proteins in biological              
              membranes.  Further applications would encompass all of the                    
              sciences, engineering, process control in the semiconductor and                
              magnetic data storage industries, in fact wherever light microscopy            
              of unprecedented high resolution can be of value.
