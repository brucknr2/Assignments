Abstract    :
                   The tectonic history of the Canada Basin is poorly understood             
              and the Mesozoic history of the Arctic margin of Alaska & NW Canada            
              is critical to this problem.  Magnetic data from the oceanic crust             
              of Canada Basin are ambiguous and cannot distinguish between (1)               
              anticlockwise oroclinal rotation of the northern margin of Alaska              
              away from the Canadian Arctic Islands about a pole of rotation new             
              the MacKenzie delta, and (2) a major left-lateral transform fault              
              to permit the southerly migration of northern Alaska.  The two                 
              models predict different structural regimes for the eastern Brooks             
              Range, MacKenzie delta, and Black River-Oglivie Mountains regions              
              during the Mesozoic this project will address the problem by                   
              structural and kinematic studies along the Porcupine River fault               
              system and adjacent areas.  Spatial variations in the geometry of              
              superposed structures will be documented from Precambrian through              
              Cenozoic rocks, and ages of deformation all be established from                
              stratigraphic and igneous intrusion relationships.  The results of             
              this study will improve our understanding of the tectonic evolution            
              of the Canada Basin and the adjacent Arctic region, and will also              
              have relevance to oil exploration in the area.
