Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              The value of time-series measurements for the understanding of                 
              natural processes, the assessment of anthropogenic effects on                  
              the environment, and the entire complex of issues referred to                  
              as "Global Change" is increasingly appreciated.  This proposal                 
              requests funds to continue time-series sediment trapping at                    
              depths of 500, 1500, and 3200 m in the sargasso Sea for three                  
              years.  At this time, the 3200 m series extends over twelve and                
              a half years.  It is by far the longest such series in                         
              existence, and its sampling site has been designated the JGOFS                 
              time-series site in the North Atlantic.  Together with the                     
              hydrographic time series at nearby Station "S" and with the                    
              growing number of JGOFS measurements, it provides an unequaled                 
              data base on physical, chemical and biological variables in the                
              open ocean.  The series has demonstrated the existence of                      
              temporal variability in the deep ocean, revealed the efficiency                
              of processes removing materials from the surface ocean, and the                
              effects of those processes on the chemistry and biology of the                 
              deep ocean.  Continuation of the Bermuda series will be an                     
              efficient route                                                                
              towards identifying the forcing functions of carbon flux to the                
              deep ocean, assessing decade-scale trends in the efficacy of the               
              "biological pump," and monitoring transport of antropogenic                    
              components to the deep ocean.//
