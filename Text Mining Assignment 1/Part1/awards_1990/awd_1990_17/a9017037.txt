Abstract    :
              Palusinski         This research applies spectral techniques to the time domain 
              simulation of integrated circuits.  The methods have been used to  compute
              transient effects in multiple transmission lines.  They  are based on the
              expansion of unknown variables in the Chebyshev  series.  This assures very
              compact representation of waveforms,  thus reducing computational penalties
              imposed by data interchange  in relaxation methods.  Tasks include:  1.    
              Modeling of MOS circuits based on modified nodal analysis;  2.     Application
              of spectral algorithms to bipolar circuits with  various model switching
              strategies;  3.     Construction of an efficient spectral algorithm for 
              computation of transients in lossy transmission lines with  frequency dependent
              parameters and nonlinear termination  networks;  4.     Using spectral
              techniques in a relaxation framework.
