Abstract    :
              This award is for support of a numerical modeling study to                     
              investigate processes and mechanisms that lead to the onset                    
              and demise of ice streams.   The stability of the West                         
              Antarctic ice streams to changes in climate and                                
              perturbations at the ice shelf boundary will also be                           
              assessed.  The project involves development of a two-                          
              dimensional map-view model of an ice stream.  Processes to                     
              be incorporated into the model include calculation of basal                    
              temperatures, basal sliding, deformation of sub-glacial                        
              till, and the ice shelf/ice stream interaction.  By imposing                   
              perturbations and/or special basal conditions, and computing                   
              the time evolution of the model ice sheet, the importance of                   
              each mechanism, as well as their mutual interactions, can be                   
              assessed.
