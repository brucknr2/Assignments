Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Proposal centers on the role of fluctuations in electronic and                 
              structural order.  Initiatives include a) energetics, interactions             
              and dynamics of the quasi-crystalline state, structure and                     
              transport in metallic fluids, and electronic fluctuation and                   
              effective interactions, b) dense classical one-component plasmas,              
              the classical inverse problem, and the quantum statistical                     
              mechanics of two component charged systems, c) condensed matter and            
              collective quantum fields, and d) geometric phase and thermal gauge            
              fields.  The notion of fluctuation based on-retarded electron                  
              attraction will also be explored with respect to superconducting               
              order.
