Abstract    :
                   The proposed research plans to improve the performance of                 
              trellis coded modulation. Trellis coded modulation (TCM) improves              
              the noise performance of digital transmission without increasing               
              the required bandwidth or reducing the effective data rate. The                
              performance improvement reduces the power requirements for                     
              transmission at a specific data rate.                                          
              %%%                                                                            
                   The primary goal is to investigate methods of analytically                
              evaluate the distance of TCM codes. In developing a simple,                    
              effective method to evaluate TCM codes distances, comparison of                
              codes will be facilitated. In addition, it is hoped that the                   
              analytical evaluation method will lead to a code design method                 
              which increases TCM code performance. The evaluation technique will            
              be confirmed by computer simulations.
