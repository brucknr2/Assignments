Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will investigate the use of optical fibers                        
              placed in concrete during the fabrication process or on the                    
              surface of existing structures in order to measure the                         
              strain movement.  With this data it will be possible to                        
              determine the condition of the material and the overall                        
              safety of the structure.
