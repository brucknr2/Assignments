Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The field of neuropeptides has exploded with activity in the past              
              few years because of advances in isolation techniques and                      
              instrumentatation for structural characterization.  Although many              
              insect neuropeptides have recently been characterized there is a               
              real paucity of information on their receptors and mode of action.             
              In researching a brain neuropeptide that regulates pheromone                   
              production in redbanded leafroller moths, Dr. Roelofs discovered               
              that the corpus bursae was essential for activity of this                      
              neuropeptide.  He now has isolated a factor from the bursa that is             
              released when the brain neuropeptide is present and this factor,               
              in turn, is involved in turning on pheromone production.  A unique             
              opportunity is presented to define the role of these peptides in               
              pheromone production.  This not only provides a basis for                      
              comparison of hormonal controls in other insect species, with                  
              implications on how this endocrine system evolved, but also will               
              allow the identification of specific genes encoding these hormones             
              for possible use in transgenic manipulations for novel insect                  
              control programs.//
