Abstract    :
                   Recent models of ocean dynamics have attempted to couple the              
              processes at the surface or near the side boundaries.  It has                  
              been difficult to integrate the physics of both into analytical                
              models.  This investigation seeks to use anlaytical models of the              
              ocean thermocline to consider the near surface and western                     
              boundary layer processes.  The models to be used will be either                
              layered or continuously stratified in the vertical direction.
