Abstract    :
                   Global scale measurements are required to obtain sufficient               
              understanding of the ocean circulation to enable models to be                  
              constructed for climate related issues.  This effort will provide              
              for the construction, deployment, and subsequent tracking of                   
              Autonomous LAgrangian Circulation Explorer (ALACE) floats which                
              drift with the ocean circulation at mid-ocean depths and bob to                
              the surface periodically to report their location and ocean data               
              via satellite.  These data, coupled with hydrographic and tracer               
              information will be used for ocean circulation models.
