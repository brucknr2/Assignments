Abstract    :
              Load tests of short columns (L/h = 5) will be monitored to                     
              determine whether yielded steel will cause premature splitting of              
              high strength concrete and if so, whether a closer spacing of ties             
              can compensate for such splitting.                                             
                                                                                             
              concrete columns (f' 8 ksi) with reinforcement Grade 150 should                
              experience crushing-spalling failure of concrete before steel                  
              yields.  Load tests of short specimens (L/h = 5) will be monitored             
              to observe the relationships that f' and spacing of transverse ties            
              have on the useful range of steel stress that can be developed                 
              before concrete fails.  Concrete columns with f' = 15000 psi and               
              Grade 150 steel will be tested to observe performance when both                
              materials are extraordinarily strong.
