Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will analyze interrelated                      
              problems concerning hyperbolic dynamical systems and compact                   
              Riemannian manifolds of negative curvature. Specifically, he will              
              investigate the classification, differentiability, and regularity              
              of stable and unstable foliations. Other directions of research                
              include investigations of rigidity and regularity of global                    
              invariants with respect to external parameters.                                
                   This project involves three areas of mathematical research.               
              Dynamical systems is study of the path of points under repeated                
              iterations of a continuous mapping. Ergodic theory studies the                 
              long term behavior of most of the points under many iterations.                
              Riemannian geometry describes the nature of the space in which                 
              the points reside; quantities such as curvature are used in the                
              description. The principal investigator will analyze several                   
              problems which stem from attempts to apply theories from all                   
              three of these areas.
