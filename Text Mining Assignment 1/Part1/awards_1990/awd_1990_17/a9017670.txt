Abstract    :
                   Sheeted dikes are common components of ophiolites, however the            
              direction of magma flow in the fissures that become dikes is                   
              essentially unknown but has considerable significance in                       
              understanding the dynamics of active mid-Ocean Ridges.  This                   
              project will utilize a well-studied ophiolite-the Troodos ophiolite            
              in Cyprus- to address this question.  The approach will be through             
              analysis of Anisotropy of Magnetic Susceptibility (AMS) in the                 
              context of petrofabrics and contact relationships of dikes.                    
              Results will provide structural data that will aid interpretations             
              of the Troodos ophiolite and provide a unique data set to assess               
              the importance of lateral intrusive propagation in sheeted dikes               
              generally.
