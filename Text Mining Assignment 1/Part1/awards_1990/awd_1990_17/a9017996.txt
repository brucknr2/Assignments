Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal is concerned with the construction of a new soft                 
              x-ray (SX) emission spectrometer and SX spectroscopy end station               
              associated with an undulator beamline at the Advanced Light Source             
              (ALS) at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory.  The undulator and high                 
              performance spherical grating monochromator will provide 40 times              
              greater photon fluxed and 200 times higher brightness that will be             
              used to enhance the intensity and/or resolution of the exciting                
              radiation.  The spectrometer and end station will greatly extend               
              the present spectral range measured in emission, allow measurement             
              of emission both perpendicular and parallel to the polarization                
              direction of the exciting beam, allow measurement of both                      
              absorption and emission spectra, greatly enhance in-situ sample                
              preparation and characterization facilities, and permit joint SX               
              spectroscopy and electron spectroscopy studies with other users of             
              the beamline.  The construction project involves scientists at the             
              University of Tennessee, Oak Ridge National Laboratory and NIST.               
              This group will jointly operate this undulator beamline at the ALS             
              with an IBM group from both Almaden and Yorktown.
