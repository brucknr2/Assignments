Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Professor Cukier is supported by a grant from the Theoretical                  
              and Computational Chemistry Program to perform research in                     
              statistical mechanics directed toward theoretical understanding                
              of electron transfer and vibrational energy transfer.  This                    
              research will provide fundamental theoretical insight into                     
              important chemical and biological processes which involve                      
              electron and vibrational energy transfer.                                      
                                                                                             
              Long distance electron transfer implies a crucial role for the                 
              intervening material between donor and acceptor in that there                  
              is a strong component of electron transport through the                        
              material.  By a combination of analytic and simulation methods,                
              Professor Cukier will explore the equilibrium and transport                    
              properties of an electron in various materials.  The aims of                   
              the vibrational energy transfer studies are to predict these                   
              rates as a function of solvent density, from gas to liquid.  In                
              dissociation-recombination reactions, the role of solvent in                   
              driving electronic-curve crossing will be explored.
