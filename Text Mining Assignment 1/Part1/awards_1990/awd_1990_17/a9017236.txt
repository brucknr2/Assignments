Abstract    :
                Studies are proposed in two main areas:  the physics of flowing              
              sand and the dynamics of heat flow and convection in liquid 3He /              
              superfluid 4He mixtures.  Specific studies:                                    
                Sand:- 1.  Using X-ray and other techniques, the propagating                 
              waves that we have discovered in simple flow experiments.  2.                  
              Continue modeling these flows using cellular automata.  3.  The                
              filamentary (and possibly fractal) stress chains which are known to            
              form in two-dimensional arrays of disks and probably occur in 3-d              
              grain arrays as well.                                                          
                Helium:- 1.  Continue an experimental and theoretical                        
              characterization of the convective states in superfluid mixtures.              
              2.  Use techniques recently developed by the P.I. to probe the                 
              transport coefficients and Kapitsa (boundary) resistance for very              
              dilute mixtures of 3He in superfluid 4He.                                      
                An understanding of granular dynamics would lead to iportant                 
              technological improvements and possibly the avoidance of                       
              catastrophes.  The proposed work on He will enhance our knowledge              
              of quantum-mechanical systems.  In addition, it is of some                     
              technical importance in that it may help to explain limitations on             
              the transport of matter, including ozone between temperate and                 
              polar latitudes.
