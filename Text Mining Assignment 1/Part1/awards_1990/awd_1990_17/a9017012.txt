Abstract    :
                   Applicants to the NSF fiscal year 1989-90 Minority Graduate               
              Fellowship competition who were given "Honorable Mention", and                 
              who enrolled as graduate students in Computer Science/Engineering              
              at a university, were eligible to apply to the CISE Directorate                
              for a Special Graduate Student Education and Research Award.                   
              Eleven universities attended by these students are being provided              
              awards of $6,000 each to assist the students with their education              
              and research.  The students will receive $5,000 of each award.                 
              These awards are designed to provide special encouragement to                  
              students who were judged worthy of a Minority Graduate                         
              Fellowship, but who, for lack of funds could not be awarded one.
