Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This program will continue the analysis of two aspects of                 
              the 1985 MCS data set from the East Pacific Rise. 1) Selective                 
              reprocessing and modeling of the CDP data will be done to the                  
              data from the 9 N survey area, which is the location of a                      
              forthcoming ODP drilling leg. 2) The nature of the velocity                    
              structure and thinckness of the uppermost crust along the EPR                  
              using Wide Aperature Profile data, will enhance the value of the               
              ODP data . Improved seismic imaging and the development of a                   
              structural context will be of value in the planning and                        
              interpretation of future detailed surveys in this area.
