Abstract    :
              This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the research              
                                                                                            
              of Professor Baumstark at Georgia State University. The results of             
                                                                                             
              this research will give new understanding to the mechanism of                  
              oxygen atom transfer from dioxiranes and from activated                        
              hydroperoxides. This type of oxidation reaction is important in                
              the synthesis of organic compounds and it is a common type of                  
              reaction in biological systems. The possibility of light-producing             
                                                                                             
              chemical reactions will also be explored.                                      
                                                                                             
              Oxygen transfer reactions will be explored with dioxiranes (three-             
                                                                                             
              membered ring peroxides) and activated hydroperoxides. The use of              
                                                                                             
              oxygen-17 labeling will play a key role in mechanistic and                     
              structural studies. Substrates for oxidation studies with                      
              dioxirane are: saturated hydrocarbons, alkenes, and polycyclic                 
              aromatic compounds. The synthesis and reactions of a series of                 
              activated hydroperoxides will be investigated. These compounds                 
              have the common structural feature of an alpha-azohydroperoxy                  
              group. In addition, these hydroperoxides may provide insight to                
                                                                                             
              biological oxidations which involve the flavin 4a-hydroperoxide.
