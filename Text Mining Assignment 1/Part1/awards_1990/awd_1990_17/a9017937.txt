Abstract    :
                   When a unidirectional current passes over a bed of coarse                 
              mixed-size sediment, a variety of bed forms are generated and                  
              there is a segregation of particle sizes among the load, the bed               
              surface layer and the substrate.  There is a strong and complex                
              interdependence between the bed forms, the transported sediment                
              and the substrate.  Many studies in well sorted sands, both in                 
              the laboratory and in the field, have led to fairly good                       
              understanding of the behavior of the familiar dune bed forms and               
              the interaction between bed forms and transport.  More recently,               
              features variously described as bed-load sheets, gravel waves,                 
              and clast jams have been reported in flows over poorly sorted                  
              sand-gravel mixtures.  The relationships among these seemingly                 
              diverse bed features, and their dependence on size segretation in              
              the bed, is unclear.                                                           
                   This is an experimental study of the nature of bed features               
              in unidirectional flows as a function of flow strength and                     
              sediment sorting involving several sediment mixtures with the                  
              same mean size of about 4mm but with widely varying sorting and                
              making series of runs at several mean flow velocities over each                
              sediment mixture.  The objective is a unified picture of the                   
              fundamental characteristics and interrelationships of the various              
              kinds of bed features produced in these flows.                                 
                   The work will be done in cooperation with Prof. Hiroshi                   
              Ikeda, Prof. Shigemi Takayama, and Dr. Fujiko Iseya of the                     
              Environmental Research center at the University of Tsukuba.  This              
              proposal covers salary and travel for the PI.  A companion                     
              proposal with identical scientific text is being submitted by                  
              Prof. John B. Southard (MIT).  The Japanese group already has                  
              funds for building the experimental apparatus and conducting the               
              experiments.
