Abstract    :
                   This study will address the tectonic evolution of St. Croix               
              during Cretaceous and Cenozoic times in order to obtain constraints            
              on the tectonic evolution of the northeastern Caribbean region and             
              the Caribbean - American plate boundary zone.  Cretaceous sedi-                
              mentary rocks on St. Croix will be analyzed to determine their age             
              range, environments of deposition, determine their age range,                  
              provenance, ages of metamorphism, and the geometry and kinematic               
              development of the tectonic complex they occupy.  Syntectonic                  
              igneous dikes, sills, and plutons will also be studied to determine            
              their age range and relationship to the developing tectonic                    
              complex.  The geometry and kinematics of the Cenozoic graben on St.            
              Croix will be examined and its relation to regional extension in               
              the NE Caribbean ascertained.  St. Croix differs from nearby                   
              islands in that it is the only subaerial exposure of bedrock                   
              between the Puerto Rico - Virgin Islands platform and the                      
              Venezuelan Basin.  Resolution of the tectonic history of St. Croix             
              as a result of this study will form an essential component in our              
              understanding of the tectonic evolution of the NE Caribbean.  The              
              results will also have important implications for understanding the            
              tectonics of major plate/micro plate interactions.
