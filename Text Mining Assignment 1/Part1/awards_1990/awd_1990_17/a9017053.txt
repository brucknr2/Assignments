Abstract    :
              This project involves the study of ultrafast processes                         
              in high temperature superconductors.  Femtosecond                              
              duration laser pulses will be used to study the                                
              response times of simple high Tc superconducting                               
              electronic devices.  The goal is to investigate the                            
              possibility of using these high Tc materials in active                         
              ultrafast electronic devices such as switches and                              
              transistors at 77K.  Preliminary results have shown                            
              that the response times of Y-Ba-Cu-O                                           
              superconductors can be as fast as 1 ps.  In this                               
              research program, high quality in-situ                                         
              superconducting thin films will be deposited by pulsed                         
              excimer lasers onto various substrates and patterned                           
              into various calculated geometries.  Microstriplines                           
              will be used predominantly, although other structures                          
              will also be examined.  Additionally, the use of hibrid                        
              devices involving both superconducting and                                     
              semiconducting films will be investigated.  The                                
              relaxation times after laser excitation will be                                
              measured by optical as well as electrical techniques as                        
              a function of material parameters such as doping and                           
              crystallinity of the films.  The use of granular films                         
              and weak link junctions to increase the speed of these                         
              devices will also be studied.  Besides applications to                         
              ultrafast electronics, this project will also contribute                       
              to the fundamental understanding of nonequilibrium                             
              phenomena in high Tc superconductors.
