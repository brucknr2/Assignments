Abstract    :
                   The concept of underplating of continental crust by magma is              
              fundamental to tectonics but is difficult to evaluate because there            
              is as yet little documented geological evidence.  This project is              
              a field-based study of an exposed zone of probable crustal under-              
              plating in the Ivrea-Verbano zone of the northern Italian Alps.                
              This zone provides an exceptional cross-section of lower                       
              continental crustal rocks extensively intruded by mafic igneous                
              rocks.  A new 1:25,000 geologic map will be prepared across the                
              Ivrea-Verbano zone, and structural and kinematic studies will be               
              undertaken at the same time.  Close collaboration with Italian                 
              geologists working in the area will be maintained throughout.  The             
              field mapping will form a basis for future detailed petrological,              
              geochemical, and geochronological studies aimed at understanding               
              the physical and chemical evolution of the underplated region.  The            
              results of this study will allow development of a general model,               
              for and will considerably improve our understanding of, the origin             
              and evolution of underplated continental crust in tectonically                 
              active regions.
