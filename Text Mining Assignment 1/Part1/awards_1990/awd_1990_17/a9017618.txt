Abstract    :
              The problem of model building is of fundamental                                
              importance to science and engineering.  Although                               
              modeling, especially linear modeling, has been                                 
              extensively investigated and applied, most of the                              
              existing frameworks are based on stochastic                                    
              approximation of the modeling error, an assumption                             
              that cannot be justified on physical ground in many                            
              applications.  A general, deterministic, modeling                              
              framework for linear systems has recently been put                             
              forward by Willems.  Parallel to this, Antoulas                                
              developed a detailed and explicit recursive realization                        
              theory, i.e. a theory of recursiveness of exact modeling                       
              based on impulse response time series.  Preliminary                            
              results have shown that the above two research projects                        
              overlap and complement each other in significant ways.                         
              This motivates investigations into the recursiveness                           
              structure of exact and approximate modeling.  These                            
              investigations, and in particular the recursiveness                            
              results, complemented with the necessary software in                           
              the form of a hard disc, will be used at a later stage to                      
              develop a new framework for deterministic adaptive                             
              control.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              We propose to develop a whole class of alternative                             
              (deterministic) ways of approaching linear recursive                           
              modeling.  It has the potential of significant impact in                       
              areas where model building is needed for predictive                            
              purposes, as well as in areas where modeling is needed                         
              for control applications, especially so, for the control of                    
              plants in dynamically changing environments.
