Abstract    :
              This project will:  1) Determine repose periods and frequency of               
              eruptions at large silicic centers by dating key stratigraphic                 
              units by 40Ar/39Ar method.  2) Provide insight into the nature                 
              and timing of overlapping volcanic activity at Quaternary-                     
              Holocene stratovolcanoes using 14C and paleomagnetic secular                   
              variation.  3) Establish the nature and geometry of a                          
              paleomagnetic excursion previously reported at Santa Maria.                    
              4) Evaluate the long-term statistical behavior of geomagnetic                  
              secular variation at low latitudes.                                            
              In addition, the PIs plan to develop long-term volcanic hazard                 
              assessment and hazard zonation maps.
