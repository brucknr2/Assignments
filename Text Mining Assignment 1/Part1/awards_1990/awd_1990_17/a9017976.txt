Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a continued study of the experimental determination of                 
              the dissolution and precipitation kinetics of silicates and                    
              aluminosilicates as functions of pH, temperature and the Gibbs                 
              Free Energy of reaction (  G); to examine the surfaces of the                  
              reacted minerals using surface analytical techniques (e.g. XPS,                
              AES, STM, AFM) which when combined with rates determined from                  
              solution chemistry using flow-through reactors will provide                    
              information on surface reaction mechanisms; and to apply the rate              
              data obtained to model low temperature, predominantly meteoric                 
              water diagenesis of a Jurassic feldspathic sandstone in the North              
              Sea.  Our experimental work is the first to describe both                      
              dissolution and precipitation rates of major rock-forming                      
              silicates and aluminosilicates as a function of   G, as well as                
              the first to measure precipitation rates in phases more complex                
              than quartz.  Incorporation of the full rate laws in an accurate               
              two-dimensional hydrodynamic model of fluid flow in porous media               
              should result in the first completely quantitative physical and                
              chemical explanation of diagenesis in a dynamic sedimentary                    
              basin.
