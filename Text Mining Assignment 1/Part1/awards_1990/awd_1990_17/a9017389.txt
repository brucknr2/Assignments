Abstract    :
                   The PI will measure the thermal dependence of magnetostriction            
              and magnetocrystalline anistrophy constants above room-temperature             
              in synthetic single crystals of titanomagnetites.  Single crystals             
              will be grown from the melt by the floating zone technique in an               
              arc image furnace at the crystal growth facility at Lawrence                   
              Livermore National Laboratory.  The single crystal work will                   
              complement work on the thermal dependence of magnetostriction in               
              polycrystalline Samples.  There are no such measurements for the               
              thermal dependence of magnetocrystalline anisotropy above room-                
              temperature for titanium-rich titanomagnetites.  The thermal                   
              dependence of these fundamental constants is important for theories            
              of thermoremanent magnetization, coercivity, and thermal dependence            
              of domain states.
