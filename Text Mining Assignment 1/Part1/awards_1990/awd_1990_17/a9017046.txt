Abstract    :
                   A liquid hydrogen target capable of operating with a heat                 
              load of 500 Watts and a Cherenkov radiation detector based                     
              electron spectrometer will be constructed for use in a new                     
              generation electron scattering parity violation experiment                     
              which will measure the flavor singlet anomalous magnetic moment                
              of the proton.  This measurement will be sensitive to the                      
              presence of strange quarks in the proton.  The experiment will                 
              be conducted at the MIT/Bates electron linear accelerator                      
              facility.
