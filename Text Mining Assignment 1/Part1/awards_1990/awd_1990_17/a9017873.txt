Abstract    :
                   The importance and tectonic significance of interarc basins               
              in the development of convergent zones are recognized in modern                
              settings where the plate tectonic environment is well defined.                 
              However their identification and characterization in ancient                   
              mountain systems require careful stratigraphic, structural,                    
              petrologic and geochemical work in order to reconstruct their                  
              original setting and subsequent history.  This collaborative                   
              project between workers at the University  of Vermont and                      
              Middlebury College will examine the Missisquoi Formation in western            
              New England that has been suggested to represent a fore-arc basin              
              deposit.  Results of extensive field mapping and geochemical                   
              studies are expected to help place the Missisquoi Formation of the             
              Taconic orogeny in Plate Tectonic terms this allowing further                  
              refinements on understanding the Ordovician Taconic orogeny.
