Abstract    :
                   An important aspect of control system design is system                    
              identification. Once the parameters of the systems are identified,             
              a controller can be designed to meet a set of design                           
              specifications. However, when there is a large range of                        
              uncertainties in an existing system model, a controller added to               
              a plant would not perform as expected. In this case, an adaptive               
              control scheme may be used, but using a learning parameter                     
              identification scheme might yield a better solution. Neural network            
              techniques seems to offer a powerful solution to this problem.                 
              Therefore, by using a neural network to learn what the parameters              
              of a complicated system are, a controller can be designed to keep              
              a good performance level.                                                      
              %%%                                                                            
                   The proposed research project would involve using a neural                
              network to identify the parameters of a system so that a better                
              controller can be designed. The objective of this research is to               
              obtain a better estimate of the parameters of any given system.                
              After a mathematical model is identified, a controller can be                  
              designed. The neural network would continually learn about the                 
              system so that the model obtained will be correct.
