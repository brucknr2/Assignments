Abstract    :
              This is a proposal to develop improvements in confocal microscopy              
              in three areas:  1) Solid-state photon detectors to increase                   
              system quantum efficiency (compared to the photomultiplier tube),              
              especially in the red and near-infrared.  2) The incorporation of              
              an additional,  full-time, operationally-transparent, detector                 
              chain for light backscattered by the specimen.  3) The                         
              development of a practical system of automatic optimal beam                    
              shaping so that the size of the focussed spot is always                        
              appropriate for the size of the voxels sampled (referred to the                
              specimen).                                                                     
                                                                                             
              To insure that these developments are made available to general                
              user groups as soon as possible, it is proposed that this                      
              prototype research take the form of a cooperative effort between               
              the PI and Bio-Rad Inc., a major American manufacturer of                      
              confocal equipment which has distinguished itself by its                       
              responsiveness to input from interested and competent users.                   
              Specifically, the support is sought to pay for partial salary,                 
              travel and laboratory expenses for research to be carried out at               
              the University of Cambridge and the Bio-Rad development                        
              laboratory in England by the PI while on sabbatical from the                   
              Integrated Microscopical Resource.  Some funds will also be used               
              during the six months preceding the sabbatical for acquiring                   
              necessary equipment in the US.
