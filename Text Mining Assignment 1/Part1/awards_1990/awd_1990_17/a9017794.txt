Abstract    :
                   This research involves a field experiment that will                       
              determine the impact of helminth parasitism on a cyclic snowshoe               
              hare population during its first 2 years of decline from peak                  
              abundance.  The overwinter food shortage and intense predation                 
              that typically occur at this stage of the hare cycle, together                 
              with major demographic changes, provide a unique opportunity to                
              test hypotheses about parasitism's interaction with malnutrition               
              and predation.                                                                 
                   The field experiment entails a 2 x 2 factoral design with                 
              three replicates.  Each replicate consists of food-added and                   
              food-normal treatments within which the demographic attributes                 
              (survival, reproduction, movements, etc.) of parasite-free and                 
              parasite-normal cohorts will be monitored through radio                        
              telemetry.  Pilot studies have demonstrated our ability to purge               
              gastrointestinal helminths and lungworms from snowshoe hares in                
              the wild and to assess proximate cause of death of radio-collard               
              hares.  The project will test long-standing theory or factors                  
              controlling population aples in vertebrate species.
