Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Benthic fluxes of inorganic nutrients are known to play                        
              important roles in carbon and nitrogen cycling in the marine                   
              environment.  At the same time fluxes of dissolved organic                     
              matter (DOM) from marine sediments represent a poorly                          
              quantified component of sedimentary organic matter                             
              remineralization that may be significant when compared to these                
              inorganic benthic fluxes.  The long-term goals of studies in                   
              this area are to examine benthic fluxes of DOM in terms of                     
              their quantitative relationship to processes associated with                   
              the early diagenesis of sedimentary organic matter.  This                      
              research initially will address these goals using the following                
              approach:  1. development of the high temperature catalytic                    
              oxidation techniques for DOC and DON analyses at Old Dominion                  
              University;  2. development of procedures for the determination                
              of benthic fluxes of DOM in studies of Chesapeake Bay                          
              sediments; and 3. preliminary studies characterizing DOM in                    
              marine sediments.
