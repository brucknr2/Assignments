              Abstract                                                                       
              Using visible light reflectance spectra, ocean sediment cores can              
              be analyzed rapidly for semi-quantitative determination of sediment            
              composition.  At present, four minerals (goethite, hematite,                   
              chlorite and smectite) and organic carbon contents have been                   
              derived from the spectra, and the present study will seek to expand            
              the data processing techniques.  Using these refined techniques,               
              cores from the tropical Atlantic will be analyzed to see the                   
              relative influence of glacial climate on the Amazon Basin and on               
              the extent and velocity of winds off the Sahara.
