Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This award provides partial funding for a technical position              
              in the College of Oceanography at the Oregon State University.  The            
              funds will be used to support a technician who will assist in the              
              operation of the College's electron microprobe instrument.                     
                   The electron microprobe at Oregon State University is used                
              intensively by a large group of researchers in oceanography, earth             
              sciences, materials science and engineering whose research requires            
              chemical microanalysis capabilities for solid materials on the                 
              micron scale.
