Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Adhesion of cells within tissues is a basic cellular process that              
              is common to all multicellular organisms. Dr. Loomis is focusing               
              his attention on the mechanisms of cell-cell adhesion in                       
              Dictyostelium that function during aggregation and subsequent                  
              morphogenesis. He has shown that a surface glycoprotein, gp24, is              
              synthesized during the first few hours of development. Antibodies              
              specific to gp24 block adhesion during this period and this                    
              activity can be neutralized by highly purified gp24. A cloned                  
              protein of the gene coding for gp24 was ligated downstream to an               
              actin promoter such that antisense RNA would be generated. Both                
              synthesis of gp24 and the acquisition of cell-cell adhesion is                 
              delayed about four hours in cell transformed with this vector.                 
              Dr. Loomis proposes to delete the pair of genes coding for gp24                
              by gene replacement in both wild type strains and in strains                   
              specifically lacking the second adhesion mechanism (contact sites              
              A). The consequences of a complete lack of gp24 throughout                     
              development will be fully determined with respect to                           
              morphogenesis and subsequent developmental gene expression.                    
              Following aggregation another adhesion mechanism appears in                    
              prespore cells that can be distinguished from the first two                    
              mechanisms by the adhesion blocking activity of specific                       
              antisera. Dr. Loomis proposes to fully characterize the essential              
              component(s) of the third adhesion mechanism.
