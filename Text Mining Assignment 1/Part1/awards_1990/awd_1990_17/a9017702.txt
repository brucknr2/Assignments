Abstract    :
                   This research will support the post doctoral investigator                 
              John Kao, who will work with the principal investigator, Volker                
              Wihstutz.  They will study necessary and sufficient and easy to                
              check Hoermander type conditions for the simplicity of the                     
              Lyapunov spectrum of a linear or linearized stochastic dynamical               
              system.  These conditions will be related to the known                         
              conditions in terms of irreducibility and contractibility of the               
              system group.
