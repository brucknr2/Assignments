Abstract    :
                   The proposal is a request for renewal of work documenting the             
              paleoenvironmental history of the glaciomarine Yakataga Formation              
              in the Gulf of Alaska.  This 5 km thick unit is a potential high-              
              resolution record of late Cenozoic glacial, climatic and                       
              depositional history.  This record is being reconstructed on the               
              basis of detailed physical sedimentologic studies and benthic                  
              foraminiferal biofacies analysis.  The prior research grant has                
              funded detailed studies of extensive Yakataga sections at Yakataga             
              Reef, Icy Bay and Middleton Island.  These have provided                       
              preliminary models of glaciomarine depositional processes which                
              involve the periodic advance and retreat of tidewater ice margins              
              across the continental margin.  The present proposal seeks to                  
              initiate an offshore subsurface study utilizing petroleum                      
              exploration wells and publically-available seismic lines.  This                
              will provide insights into the youngest Yakataga Formation which               
              does not crop out, and better control on depositional geometries               
              in the formation.  Once these studies are complete we will be                  
              better able to "read" the depositional and paleoenvironmental                  
              record of the Yakatage Formation and establish it as a high-                   
              resolution climatic and glacial record for the late Cenozoic of the            
              North Pacific.  It will also serve as the basis for increasingly               
              detailed glaciomarine facies models.
