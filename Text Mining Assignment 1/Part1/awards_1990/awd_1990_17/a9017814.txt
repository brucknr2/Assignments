Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The aims of the proposed study are to determine if peripheral and              
              central osmoreceptors regulate the release of arginine vasotocin               
              (AVT) and mesotocin (MT) from the fowl neurohypophysis and to                  
              begin a characterization of the afferent and efferent circuitries              
              of the paraventricular nucleus (PVN).  The effects of stimulating              
              putative intracranial and cardiac osmoreceptors on the release of              
              the hormones will be observed.  Release of catecholamines at the               
              PVN in response to peripheral stimuli will be related to the                   
              character and loci of adrenergic receptors in the anterior                     
              hypothalamus.  Evoked changes in neurohypophysial and autonomic                
              functions will be compared with release of AVT and MT at nerve                 
              terminals in the brainstem and the properties and loci of                      
              peptidergic receptors.  Adrenergic and peptide receptors will be               
              studied using radioligand assays on membranes and tissue                       
              sections.  AVT and MT are measured by radioimmunoassays.  The                  
              neural circuitry is studied using stereotaxic and intracranial                 
              microperfusion techniques.  The results of the proposed study                  
              will increase our understanding of the physiology of AVT and MT                
              in the fowl and the role the peptides play in regulating the                   
              endocrine and autonomic mechanisms that maintain homeostasis.
