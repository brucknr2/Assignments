Abstract    :
              With this award the Office of Special Projects of the Chemistry                
              Division and the Undergraduate Science, Engineering and                        
              Mathematics Education Division are supporting a symposium                      
              designed to focus attention on the critical need for curricular                
              revision of the general chemistry programs at U.S. colleges and                
              universities.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              The symposium will be held in conjunction with the 200th                       
              National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in                           
              Washington, D.C. on August 26, 1990.  The symposium, sponsored                 
              jointly by the Committee on Professional Training of the                       
              American Chemical Society, the National Science Foundation, and                
              the American Chemical Society Education Division, will examine                 
              the feasibility and vitality of non-traditional approaches to                  
              teaching introductory chemistry.  The outcome of the event is                  
              anticipated to be a heightened awareness of the advantages of                  
              new approaches and stimulation for curriculum development.                     
              Publication of the proceedings of the meeting will reach those                 
              colleges and universities that graduate more than 90% of the                   
              nation's chemistry bachelors degrees.
