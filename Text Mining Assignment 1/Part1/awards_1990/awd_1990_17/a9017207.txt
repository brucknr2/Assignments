Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary objective of this U.S.-Poland research                             
              project between Dr. Mitchell Begelman of the University                        
              of Colorado, Boulder, and Dr. Marek Sikora of the                              
              Copernicus Astronomical Center, Warsaw, is to improve                          
              our understanding of the workings of active galactic                           
              nuclei.  The researchers will do this by studying the                          
              astrophysical consequences of their hypothesis that                            
              relativistic protons are produced in quasars and other                         
              active galactic nuclei (AGNs).  Their work should yield                        
              quantitative predictions about the fluxes of very high                         
              energy gamma rays and neutrinos.  Detections of these                          
              particles would demonstrate the significance of                                
              relativistic hadrons in AGNs and potentially support the                       
              theory that they play a key role in formation of strong                        
              quasar winds.  Results may solve several theoretical                           
              problems related to the observed galactic phenomena of                         
              BEL (broad emission line) and BAL (broad absorption                            
              line) regions.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              This project in extragalactic astronomy fulfills the                           
              program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by                         
              enabling leading experts in the United States and                              
              Eastern Europe to combine complimentary talents and                            
              pool research resources in areas at strong mutual                              
              interest and competence.
