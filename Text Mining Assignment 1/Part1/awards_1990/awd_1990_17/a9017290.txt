Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to establish a series of one-day workshops         
              for researchers in theoretically  oriented fields of computer science          
              in the Midwest United States.  The plan is to hold the meeting twice a         
              year in the Midwest to discuss latest results in theoretical aspects           
              of computer science and methodologies to transfer them to applied              
              fields.
