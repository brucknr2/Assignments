Abstract    :
              This renewal research is aimed at the synthesis and                            
              characterization of a unique class of alkalide and electride                   
              materials.  Optical, electrical and magnetic properties will be                
              determined, and structural studies by X-ray single crystal and                 
              powder methods will be used to provide structure-function                      
              correlations.  The use of alkalides and electrides as aprotic                  
              reducing agents in both organic and inorganic chemistry will be                
              explored.
