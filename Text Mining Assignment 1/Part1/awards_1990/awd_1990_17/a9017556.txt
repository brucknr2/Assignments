Abstract    :
                   Drying processes are used in almost all major industries from             
              agriculture to plastics, yet are only 40-45% efficient. An advanced            
              model for a drying system, presented in a user-friendly software               
              format, could aid in both overall system efficiency and in the                 
              design and maintenance of the drier drums in the case of the pulp              
              and paper industry. Although much work is available discussing heat            
              and mass transfer through porous media, very few models have been              
              developed for fibrous media and water removal systems. In general,             
              existing models either incorporate too many assumptions or else                
              fail to correlate with experimental data.                                      
              %%%                                                                            
                   The intent of this research is to develop a suitable model                
              which, once reduced by acceptable assumptions and approximations,              
              can be solved numerically. A software package will then be                     
              developed to simulate entire drying systems.
