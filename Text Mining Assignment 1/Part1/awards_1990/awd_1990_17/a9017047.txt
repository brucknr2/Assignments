Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Qualitative simulation is a method for representing incomplete,                
              qualitative knowledge about the structure of a mechanism, in the               
              form of a qualitative differential equation (QDE), and deriving                
              qualitative predictions about the possible behaviors of the                    
              mechanism.  Reliable inference about continuous mechanisms in                  
              spite of incomplete knowledge is critical to the fundamental AI                
              tasks of diagnosis and design, where one's knowledge is                        
              necessarily incomplete                                                         
                                                                                             
              The QSIM program provides a simple, clear representation for                   
              qualitative structure (QDEs) and qualitative behavior, and a                   
              clean, efficient algorithm for qualitative simulation.  This                   
              award supports its documentation and distribution through the                  
              Software Capitalization Program.
