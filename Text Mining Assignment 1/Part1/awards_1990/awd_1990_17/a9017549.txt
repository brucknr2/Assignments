Abstract    :
              This award will support research utilizing the particle-                       
              size distribution technique to examine the Oligocene to                        
              Pleistocene paleocirculation of Circumpolar Deep Water and                     
              Antarctic Bottom Water.  Cores returned by (Ocean Drilling                     
              Program) ODP Legs 114 and 119 scientists.  Therefore, this                     
              will be a major improvement over the methods used previously                   
              that required correlation of paleocirculation and                              
              paleoclimatic events found at separate locations.  This                        
              investigation will correlate paleocurrent events with                          
              paleoclimatic events revealed in micropaleontologic and                        
              geochemical parameters.
