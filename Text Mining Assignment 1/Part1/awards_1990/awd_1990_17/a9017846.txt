Abstract    :
                   The Marclaren Glacier metamorphic belt represents a deep-                 
              seated megashear between Alaska and the Wrangellia superterrane.               
              Prior work has shown that melt was intruded into the megashear                 
              while in a compressive regime.  This renewal will incorporate                  
              cooling dates into a comprehensive cooling and exhumation model                
              of the area, and refine metamorphic reactions.  Results will                   
              provide insight into the factors which control strain in the                   
              lower crust during continental convergence and accretion.
