Abstract    :
                   This award provides support to the National Materials                     
              Advisory Board (NMAB) to convene a committee to identify                       
              fundamental research in materials in order to provide the basis                
              for new materials in the 21st Century.  The committee will                     
              organize a workshop of some 25  to 30 individuals to access the                
              many disciplines incorporated in materials science and                         
              engineering.  The emphasis will be on postulating innovative                   
              approaches to new materials based on fundamental parameters                    
              governing the behavior of materials and on changes in processing               
              parameters now taking place.  The workshop will be structured to               
              allow for maximum exchange of ideas and discussion in a free form              
              mode, and the committee will draw their conclusions and base                   
              their recommendations on the discussions.  The study will be                   
              coordinated with the Solid State Sciences Committee of the Board               
              on Physics and Astronomy.
