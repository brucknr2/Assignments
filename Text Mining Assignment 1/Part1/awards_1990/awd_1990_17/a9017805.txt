Abstract    :
              It is the purpose of this project to continue to make balloon borne            
              measurements of ozone, polar stratospheric cloud (PSC) particles               
              and condensation nuclei in the stratosphere above McMurdo,                     
              Antarctica during the austral springtime.  This work is required               
              to further understanding of the annual Antarctic ozone hole.  It               
              is known that the principal cause of the ozone depletion is                    
              chlorine, and that the PSCs play a major role in the chemistry,                
              freeing the elemental chlorine from the reservoir gases,                       
              hydrochloric acid and chlorine nitrate, so that it is available for            
              the photocatalytic destruction of the ozone at the time of sunrise.            
              Very little is presently known about the details of the formation              
              and physical state of the particles in the PSCs, and it is expected            
              that this project will continue to improve the state of knowledge              
              of this important subject.
