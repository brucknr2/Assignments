Abstract    :
                   In recent decades increased competition has occurred among                
              industries at the international level.  An increase in national                
              and regional industrial productivity appears essential in this                 
              highly competitive climate.  There is a need for new graduates in              
              engineering and engineering technology to be capable of quickly                
              making contributions in industry upon graduation.  This project                
              is aimed at providing engineering and engineering technology                   
              students with educational experiences in computer-based                        
              industrial measurements and control that will allow them to more               
              quickly and more intelligently make their contributions.                       
                                                                                             
                   This project utilizes industrial-quality computers,                       
              interfacing equipment, and transducers that are assembled in                   
              order that ten experiments are performed in computer control of                
              industrial processes.  At least five third and fourth year                     
              courses are affected.  The award is being matched by an equal                  
              amount from the principal investigator's institution.
