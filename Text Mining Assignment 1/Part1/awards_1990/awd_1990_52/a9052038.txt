Abstract    :
              Loras College is revising its curriculum for the calculus based                
              introductory physics course.  The model for the calculus-based                 
              course has the following highlighted features:  (1)  incorporation             
              of MBL components from the Dickinson College Workshop Physics                  
              Project, (2) IEEE-488 based interface experiments in electricity,              
              magnetism and electronics, (3) ten spreadsheet study modules                   
              emphasizing contemporary and ocmputational topics, and (4)                     
              integrated tutorial, communications and data analysis exercises.               
              The addition of five MAC IIcx systems with Microsoft Works, six                
              IEEE based Keithley stations, a networked Laser writer, and five               
              copies of SuperCalc3 spreadsheet complement the Apple IIe systems              
              on hand and allow implementation of courseware already developed.              
              Using locally generated funding and personal time, a complete                  
              Laboratory Manual, interface experiments, and ten spreadsheet                  
              modules have been developed by the Loras College Physics                       
              Department.  The present project permits immediate implementation,             
              further classs testing, and publication of new materials as called             
              for in Phase III of the Introductory University Physics Project.               
              One IBM Ps/2 system will permit the development of transportable               
              versions  of the spreadsheet modules and one copy of Mathematica               
              will permit the development of the next aspect of the curriculum               
              revision, incorporation of math solvers in the syllabus of the                 
              calculus based course.  The college is matching the award with an              
              equal amount of funds.//
