Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A new curriculum will be developed whose goals are: (1) to lead                
              students to inquire into the world around them through hands-on                
              astronomical experiences and (2) to present science as a cautious              
              process devised by and for human exploration and interpretation.               
              Small telescopes will be purchased.  Equipment to connect to a                 
              remote new 3.5-m research telescope will be purchased.  Personal               
              computers will be used to allow students to simulate the changes               
              of the sky.
