Abstract    :
              The focus of this project is the development of an                             
              undergraduate honors program in parallel processing.  The                      
              principles of parallel processing and the engineering of                       
              parallel programming cannot be taught in a single course.                      
              Nor can they be mastered in a small number of laboratory                       
              exercises.  The proposed honors program will address                           
              these needs by requiring a carefully planned introduction to                   
              the underlying principles, techniques and mechanisms,                          
              including architecture, operating systems, algorithms,                         
              compilers, and concurrent programming languages.  A Sequent                    
              Symmetry system is to be acquired for the development and                      
              implementation of the honors program.                                          
                   Parallel computing will play a major role in scientific                   
              computing in the future.  It is imperative that                                
              undergraduates begin to be trained in this important                           
              discipline now.
