Abstract    :
              This project establishes an undergraduate laboratory for large-                
              scale programming that permits the instruction of students in the              
              necessary disciplines for team development of today's larger                   
              software systems.  The laboratory is based on state-of-the-art                 
              Solbourne and Sun Workstations using the CADRE "Teamwork" CASE                 
              environment.  Computer Science majors use the laboratory for the               
              courses Software Engineering I, Software Engineering II, Systems               
              Project, and Unix and C Programming.                                           
                                                                                             
              The award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal               
              investigator's institution.
