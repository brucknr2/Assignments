Abstract    :
              Laboratories and classrooms equipped with Macintosh computers running          
              Mathematica are being used by students to learn calculus in a radically        
              different mode.  Materials developed by Duke University's Project CALC         
              (funded by NSF) are being modified for a liberal arts college setting.         
                                                                                             
              The institution will contribute an amount equal to the award.
