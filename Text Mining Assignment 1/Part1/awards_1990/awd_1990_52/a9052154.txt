Abstract    :
              This project introduces Laser Electro-Optics/Fiber Optics and                  
              Engineering Technology students to the properties of an Excimer Laser          
              system.  This system (with wavelengths from 350nm to 175nm) can also be        
              linked to a Dye Laser to produce wavelengths below 175nm.  This overall        
              range is important because of the current interest in applications in          
              fusion, medicine, and thin films.  Students gain experience in                 
              determining the attenuation of ultraviolet wavelengths through a               
              variety of waveguides, testing different materials for absorption and          
              reflection properties, and the finding the effects on various animal           
              tissue samples and crystals.  The award is being matched by an equal           
              amount from the principal investigator's institution.
