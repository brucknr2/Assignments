Abstract    :
              Through this project, the Department of Chemistry acquired a FTIR,             
              HPLC, and Atomic Absorption and UV-Visible spectrometers.  These               
              systems are computer accessed and controlled.  The use and                     
              application of the instrumentation affects all students within the             
              science division.  The project is designed specifically to improve             
              the science instruction capabilities of the institution, and                   
              strengthen and upgrade the instrumental analysis and physical                  
              chemistry laboratories. Students' experiences in instrumental                  
              methods, their knowledge of modern analytical techniques, and their            
              laboratory skills have been greatly enhanced by this project.  The             
              project has aided in increasing the instrumental emphasis in                   
              certain coursed, the depth and scope of experimentation in others,             
              and the students' knowledge of computer interface.  The project has            
              also provided students with hands-on experience in basic                       
              spectroscopy.  The institution has contributed to this project in              
              an amount equal to the NSF funds.
