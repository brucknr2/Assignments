Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Through this project, the institution acquired a FT-IR                         
              spectrometer and ATR and diffuse reflectance accessories.  The                 
              instrument replaced a dispersive IR that was purchased in 1965                 
              for which repair costs had frequently exceeded the value of the                
              instrument and replacement parts were no longer available.  The                
              FT-IR is being used in courses such as organic, physical,                      
              spectrometric identification of organic compounds, and                         
              introduction to research.  In addition to being used for the                   
              experiments previously done with the dispersive IR, the new                    
              instrument and accessories enable the students to carry out new                
              experiments such as spectra of aqueous and dilute solutions,                   
              opaque solids such as polymers and minerals, cut outs from TLC                 
              separations, and high resolution spectra of gases.  The computer               
              controlled instrument allows the manipulation of data in                       
              analyzing mixtures and the creation of one's own spectral                      
              library.  Also of prime importance is the fact that industrial                 
              employees and graduate schools expect that a bachelor's degree                 
              chemist can operate a FT-IR instrument and is familiar with the                
              mathematical manipulations and capabilities of the Fourier                     
              transform technique.  The FT-IR also played an important role in               
              the phasing in of microscale in the organic chemistry labs.                    
                                                                                             
              The institution is contributing to the project in an amount equal              
              the NSF funds.
