Abstract    :
              The Chemistry, Biology and Core curricula have been integrated around          
              the central theme of organic structure characterization.  Experiments          
              in Analytical, Organic and Physical Chemistry, in Environmental Biology        
              and in the Core course, Chemist and Color, benefit from common lectures        
              on the theme and the development of related experiments.  Central to           
              this integration is a Fouier Transform Infrared Spectrophotometer, used        
              as a a student research and pedagogical tool in pigment analysis of            
              medieval manuscripts, environmental pollution monitoring and                   
              characterization, and molecular spectroscopic techniques as part of the        
              courses Physical, Analytic and Organic Chemistry.  The grantee provides        
              funds for this project that are an equal match for the NSF award.
