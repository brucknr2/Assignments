Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to the Political Science Department at               
              the University of Iowa to help purchase equipment to support a                 
              computer classroom which takes advantage of the confluence of                  
              advances in high speed microcomputers, advances in graphical                   
              capabilities for data analysis, and advances in interactive                    
              educational software to provide individualized, interactive                    
              instruction in quantitative analysis.  This approach to teaching               
              undergraduates political science is grounded in the understanding              
              that student interest in technical tools does not emerge in a                  
              substantive vacuum; rather, it emerges as an offshoot from a desire            
              to answer a real-world problems posed by the discipline.  Both the             
              initial interest in technical knowledge and the subsequent                     
              enthusiasm for its utility are intimately tied to the substance of             
              political problems "discovered" by students.  Hence, the Department            
              is intent on keeping this technical education in the courses where             
              those problems are in point.  The computer classroom should launch             
              many students on an intellectual voyage of discovery, a voyage                 
              where their new technical knowledge could permit them to study                 
              politics and public policy in ways previously beyond their reach.              
              The grantee is matching this award with non-Federal sources.
