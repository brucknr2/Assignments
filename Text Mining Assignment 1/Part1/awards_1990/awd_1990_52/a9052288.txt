Abstract    :
              To improve the introductory laboratories, the Physics Department is            
              introducing microcomputer-based laboratory (MBL) instruments into the          
              laboratory curriculum.  The equipment consists of eight                        
              microcomputers along with sensors and software that can be utilized            
              in all of the physics department's undergraduate laboratories.  The            
              sensors are interfaced to the microcomputers to measure physical               
              quantities such as position, velocity, acceleration, force,                    
              temperature, sound and light.  As measurements are taken, data                 
              obtained by the sensors are displayed in digital and graphical form            
              that can be later manipulated and analyzed giving students                     
              unprecedented power to explore, measure, and learn from the physical           
              world.  MBL instruments have been shown to make the understanding of           
              physical phenomena more accessible to the naive science learner, and           
              they expand the investigations that more advanced students can                 
              undertake.  The purchase and implementation of MBL instruments will            
              significantly benefit students because recent research in educational          
              and cognitive science verify the importance for students to have               
              solid empirical and heavily phenomenological experiences in                    
              developing their science skills and learning concepts.  The                    
              University is matching the award with an equal amount of funds.
