Abstract    :
              Susquehanna University requested ;matching funds to acquire a                  
              Hewlett Packard Gas Chromatograph/Mass Spectral detector (GC/MS)               
              with an accompanying computer-based data station.  The Chemistry               
              Department introduces its students to "hands on" use of modern                 
              instruments throughout their four year program.  Mass spectrometry             
              is the only form of spectroscopy that is taught in depth at                    
              Susquehanna for which there is no "hands on" experience in the                 
              laboratory.  The Chemistry Department used this instrument to                  
              introduce the principles and techniques of mass spectrometry and               
              capillary column gas chromatography into the laboratory curriculum             
              at a number of levels.  Starting in the freshman year, the                     
              chemistry and biochemistry majors in doing specials projects                   
              outside of the classroom and lab, used the instrument to analyze               
              for triazines in ground and surface waters in the surrounding                  
              agriculture community.  the GC/MS was used in five courses as well             
              as in the senior research program and the triazine study.                      
              The students acquired much broader knowledge of the use of computer            
              based instrumentation especially in the area of mass spectrometry              
              and entered industry and graduate school better prepared to use                
              modern computer controlled instruments.
