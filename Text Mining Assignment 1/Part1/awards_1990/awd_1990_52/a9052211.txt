Abstract    :
                   Four to six experiments in Computational Physics will be                  
              added to a senior physics laboratory.  Students will be spared                 
              the task of writing computer programs.  Instead, commercial                    
              software will be used as primary tools.  The inclusion of the                  
              studies of chaos in non-linear dynamics, orbit simulation of                   
              spacecraft under the influence of both the earth and the moon,                 
              etc will enrich the experience of the students and acquaint                    
              them with a practical approach to "real world" problems.
