Abstract    :
              SUNY Brockport is acquiring an AIR Inc. ADAS multisonde/tethersonde            
              system along with an optical theodolite. This equipment bolsters the           
              meteorology program's emphasis on atmospheric observations and field           
              research methods. The system provides vertical profiles of temperature,        
              pressure, humidity and wind by means of expendable radiosondes or              
              tethered balloon sounding packages. This sounding equipment allows             
              students in introductory synptics, weather forecasting, air pollution,         
              and micrometeorology classes to obtain a more complete three-                  
              dimensional understanding of atmospheric processes. The equipment is           
              used in a new course in field methods as well, which is the                    
              cornerstone of the program emphasis on observational research.                 
              Students gain valuable experience working with state-of-the-art field          
              research equipment, gaining knowledge in observational methods which           
              will serve them well in future graduate studies or career pursuits. The        
              college will contribute 112% of the award.
