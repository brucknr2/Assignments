Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project has enabled the institution to acquire a General                  
              Electric OMEGA 300NB MNR instrument with various accessories.                  
              The acquisition was seen as necessary for proper introduction of               
              the underclass students to FT-NMR techniques, and to allow                     
              upperclass students to perform various advanced experiments.                   
              Most importantly, it was a necessary addition to the department's              
              arsenal of equipment to permit first-rate undergraduate research               
              to proceed at a reasonable pace.  Research projects that will                  
              involve the new instrument include photodimerization of tropone,               
              synthesis of propellances and other strained molecules,                        
              characterization of metalloenzyme models, investigation of shale-              
              gas interactions, and orientation studies in polymers.                         
                                                                                             
              The institution has contributed to the project an amount in                    
              excess of twice the NSF funds
