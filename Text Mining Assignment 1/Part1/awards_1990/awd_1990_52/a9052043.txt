Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to integrate computer applications into            
              the laboratory through the use of cost-effective workstations.  The            
              equipment purchased includes eight, 80386 based computer workstations          
              with General Purpose Interface Bus (GPIB) controllers that share four          
              sets of computer controlled laboratory equipment.  The test equipment          
              includes a digital multimeter, a synthesized waveform generator, a             
              multiple output power supply, and a digital storage oscilloscope.              
              Hardcopy output is provided by four shared laser printers with                 
              plotter capability. This equipment supports and enhances the                   
              laboratory by providing fast, automatic data acquisition and analysis          
              capabilities, and graphical display and hardcopy functions.                    
              Laborious repetitive measurements are eliminated, allowing valuable            
              laboratory time to be spent investigating various designs, options,            
              and results.  Student acquired data is compared to computer                    
              simulations with the immediate feedback used to improve experimental           
              techniques.  Previously unavailable transient response and waveform            
              analysis methods enhance the overall learning experience. The award            
              is being matched by an equal amount from the principal investigator's          
              institution.
