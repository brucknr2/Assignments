Abstract    :
                   This project will support the establishment of a statistical              
              teaching laboratory.  It is being funded under the                             
              Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement (ILI) Program, which                
              has the goal of supporting projects to develop new or improved                 
              instrument-based undergraduate laboratory courses in science,                  
              mathematics, or engineering.  The Instrumentation and Laboratory               
              Improvement Program provides matching support for the                          
              instrumentation necessary to implement undergraduate                           
              instructional improvements at U.S. colleges and universities.                  
                   In particular, the main objective of this project is to                   
              enhance the teaching of statistics to undergraduate engineering                
              students.  The statistical teaching laboratory will be configured              
              so that demonstrations of simulations and statistical engineering              
              principles can be brought to students and so that students can                 
              use the laboratory to perform exercises, simulations, and                      
              otherwise interact with computer programs designed to demonstrate              
              statistical concepts.  The primary courses to be affected are                  
              introductory engineering statistics, introductory probability and              
              statistics, and statistics for quality and productivity                        
              improvement.
