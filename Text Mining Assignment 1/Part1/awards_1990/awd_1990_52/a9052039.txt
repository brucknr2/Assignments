Abstract    :
              Undergraduate education in cellular biology is being improved with the         
              introduction of a Zeiss Transmission Electron Microscope with video            
              accessories and a Polaroid CRT photosystem. The equipment is to be used        
              in laboratories in introductory botany,  introductory zoology, and cell        
              biology courses. Its use in the introductory courses will stimulate            
              students to take the more advanced course. In the introductory level           
              courses, its use is  mostly through demonstrations, but in the cell            
              biology course, students  get "hands on" experiences with the E.M.,            
              including experimentation and analysis of results. The instrument is           
              also available for student independent research projects. The                  
              university will overmatch the award by $9,147.
