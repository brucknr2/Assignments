Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                  Ground penetrating radar (GPR) is widely used as a practical              
              tool in engineering and applied science, even though it is                     
              generally absent from university curricula and textbooks.                      
              Vigorous development by manufacturers has produced systems which               
              are no more expensive than other types of engineering geophysical              
              equipment.  The graphical cross sections produced by GPR will                  
              make it suitable for use by non.engineers or at a very early                   
              stage of instruction.  The equipment is also used in a highly                  
              quantitative mode by transferring the data to graphic                          
              workstations.  Our curricula lack hands.on experience with this                
              modern tool, and we propose to correct deficiency by acquiring                 
              GPR instrumentation and incorporating it into four departmental                
              curricula:

              GPR will impact twenty.nine courses in four departments and the                
              Women in Engineering and Minorities in Engineering Programs.
