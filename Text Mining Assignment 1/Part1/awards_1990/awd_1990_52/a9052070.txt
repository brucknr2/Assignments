Abstract    :
              The geology and biology departments at Middlebury jointly run a                
              Marine Sciences program, and teach basic oceanographic and                     
              limnological courses that use Lake Champlain to demonstrate                    
              physical and biological phenomena. They are acquiring new                      
              instrumentation for installation on their research vessel, which               
              allows for upgrading instruction in introductory and upper division            
              courses, as well as student research projects. The equipment                   
              includes an integrated navigation system, a CTD profiling system,              
              fish and plankton nets, an underwater remotely operated vehicle                
              (ROV), sediment sampling devices, and an atmospheric monitoring                
              system. With this new equuipment, they are able to instruct                    
              students in modern research techniques using computer assisted data            
              acquisition and analysis. Additionally, students will be able to               
              contribute to the data base on Lake Champlain. The college will                
              contribute an amount equal to the award.
