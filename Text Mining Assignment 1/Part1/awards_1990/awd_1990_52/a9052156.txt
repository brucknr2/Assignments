Abstract    :
                   This project focuses on the development of a set of                       
              undergraduate laboratory courses in microelectronics                           
              processing.  These courses complement the extensive                            
              collection of lecture classes in microelectronics by                           
              providing hands-on experience for the students.  The first                     
              quarter course concentrates on experiments to teach the                        
              steps of device fabrication such as photoresist, etching and                   
              oxidation.  The second quarter course allows deeper                            
              investigation of the scientific details of fabrication.                        
              Given that progress in  microelectronics has historically                      
              been a result of strong interdisciplinary activity, the                        
              course will be offered to students in physics, chemistry,                      
              chemical engineering, electrical engineering, and                              
              materials engineering.                                                         
                   This project is significant because it will introduce                     
              the microelectronic device fabrication process to                              
              undergraduates early in their academic life through hands-on                   
              laboratory experimentation.
