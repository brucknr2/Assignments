Abstract    :
              This project further improves undergraduate laboratory instruction for         
              students in food science programs through the purchase of a                    
              microcomputer-controlled, high speed, refrigerated centrifuge and              
              accessories which allow the program to take full advantage of their            
              analytical instrumentation. In the Biochemistry course, new experiments        
              focus on molecular biology; these include DNA isolation and                    
              characterization, plasmid isolation and restriction endonuclease               
              mapping, and enzyme purification and kinetics. In food chemistry,              
              experiments done with the high speed centrifuge involve the isolation          
              of proteins from treated food samples for amino acid analysis, and             
              purification and characterization of the enzymes responsible for the           
              browning of fruits and vegetables. In addition, the instrument is              
              available for student research in all areas of chemistry. The                  
              university is contributing an amount equal to the award.
