Abstract    :
              This project improves the sophistication of cellular and molecular             
              components of the curriculum. The department is redesigning a course           
              for majors to introduce them to the major building blocks of living            
              organisms, and to teach them the modern techniques of molecular                
              biology. The purchase of centrifuges, liquid chromatography, paper             
              chromatography, and electrophoresis equipment, photographic                    
              equipment, and of a UV/visible spectrophotometer allows the                    
              department to introduce new laboratory experiences involving cell              
              fractionation; protein, DNA and RNA separations; quantitative                  
              measurement of proteins and nucleic acids; restriction digestion of            
              nucleic acids, and the cloning of restriction fragments. The                   
              instruments are also being used in Immunology and Genetics courses             
              and laboratories in Plant Physiology. The college will contribute an           
              amount equal to the award.
