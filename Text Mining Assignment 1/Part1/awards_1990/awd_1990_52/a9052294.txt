Abstract    :
              A new laboratory course in Techniques for Cell Biology is being                
              developed, using cultured cells to teach techniques and prepare                
              students for conducting research. Students employ predesigned                  
              protocols to study the inner medullary collecting duct cells of                
              the rat kidney and selected immortal cell lines. They then                     
              conduct independent research on the featured cell line type.                   
              Techniques taught include basic cell culture, cell fractionation,              
              molecular separation, and use of immunological, radioactive, and               
              fluorescent labeling. A CO2 incubator, laminar flow bench,                     
              cryopreservation unit, and inverted microscope are used for cell               
              culture. A high speed centrifuge, fraction collector, and                      
              spectrophotometer are used for cell fractionation and analysis of              
              cell components. Equipment for fluorescent microscopy and a                    
              scintillation counter allow identification of specific cell                    
              components. The course extends the department's emphasis on                    
              first-hand experience and independent research into the field of               
              cell biology. The college will contribute an amount equal to the               
              award.
