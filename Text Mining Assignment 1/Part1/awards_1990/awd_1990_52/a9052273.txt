Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The department of chemistry was without an adequately functioning              
              U. V.-visible spectrophotometer and so basic but fundamentally                 
              important laboratory experiments could not be performed.  The                  
              acquisition of a spectrophotometer with a computer work station                
              increased the teaching effectiveness of the department's                       
              inorganic and biochemistry laboratory courses and at the same                  
              time, modernized the labs.  The instrument is used to teach the                
              relationship between U. V.-visible spectra and chemical                        
              processes.  The computer is used in the acquisition and storage                
              of data, and in fitting the data to various models.  The                       
              instrument is extensively used in the biochemistry course where                
              it is a powerful tool in the study of macromolecule.  In fact,                 
              the instrument allowed development of a two semester biochemistry              
              laboratory that emphasizes isolation and characterization of                   
              proteins and nucleic acids.  The spectrophotometer also is used                
              in undergraduate research projects.  Student research is an                    
              important part of the chemistry curriculum at the institution and              
              several research problems are being undertaken which could not be              
              carried out previously.                                                        
                                                                                             
              The institution is contributing to the project in an amount equal              
              to the NSF funds.
