Abstract    :
                   The goal of this project is to provide a modular flexible                 
              manufacturing system for teaching instrumentation fundamentals at              
              the undergraduate technology level.  The project provides                      
              students with access to modern automated instrumentation and                   
              control schemes and "hands-on" experience with controllers,                    
              sensors, adaptive control concepts, integrated computer controls,              
              real-time control, and demonstrates the advantages of                          
              multitasking.  The experience gained through this laboratory                   
              allows Mechanical Engineering Technology graduates to make an                  
              immediate contribution to the manufacturing industry.                          
                                                                                             
                   The award is being matched by an equal amount from the                    
              principal investigator's institution.
