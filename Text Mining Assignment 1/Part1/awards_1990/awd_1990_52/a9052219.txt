Abstract    :
              This project supports the improvement of the modern optics                     
              laboratory component of several courses by introducing current                 
              instrumentation related to setting up and testing a fiber optics               
              telecommunications network.  The pedagogical format is that of a               
              traditional laboratory with a carefully constructed write-up and               
              prototyping to ensure that students can maximize their learning                
              during the available time.  Students construct a "mini-network"                
              with components capable of handling an FDDI rate of 100 Megabits               
              per second.  Using commercial bit error rate test sets, students               
              learn how to measure the bit-error rate for the system.  With a                
              wideband oscilloscope they produce an "eye" diagram and learn to               
              interpret its representation of transmission quality.  They also               
              learn to use optical time domain reflectometers to acquire a                   
              detailed characterization of the fiber cable, including splice                 
              losses, connector losses, fiber attenuation, and end reflection                
              with high resolution.  They also measure material and modal                    
              dispersion on commercial optical fiber.  All instruments are                   
              representative of those that a technician working with fiber optics            
              would be likely to use.  Much of this is, nevertheless, appropriate            
              for pre-engineering students.                                                  
                                                                                             
              The award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal               
              investigator's institution.
