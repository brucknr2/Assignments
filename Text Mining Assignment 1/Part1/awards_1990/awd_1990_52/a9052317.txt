Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The goal of this project is the improvement of facilities for                  
              analyzing compounds and mixtures in the chemistry department.                  
              The improvement is occurring in conjunction with changes in the                
              chemistry curriculum that expose chemistry students to modern                  
              instrumental techniques and real-world problems much earlier in                
              their college experience.  A mass-selective detector for the                   
              department's capillary gas chromatograph is being used for                     
              demonstrations at the freshman level to generate student interest              
              in chemistry.  In later organic and analytical chemistry courses,              
              students are using the GC-MS to solve increasingly challenging                 
              problems.  Seniors in these fields of chemistry, as well as the                
              departments of environmental science and biology, are using the                
              GC-MS to perform original research as part of the required, year-              
              long senior research project.  With the availability of the GC-                
              MS, seniors are tackling a wider range of research problems, and               
              their results are more accurate and meaningful.                                
                                                                                             
              The institution has contributed to this project in an amount                   
              equal to the NSF funds.
