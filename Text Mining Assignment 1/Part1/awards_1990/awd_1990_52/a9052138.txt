Abstract    :
              A series of lab exercises are being developed that will enhance                
              the students' understanding of cell function. These complement                 
              previously existing exercises on cell structure. To isolate and                
              purify cell components, an ultracentrifuge and rotors are being                
              purchased. The instrument, the Beckman TL-100, has small sample                
              volumes and high centrifugal forces to effect rapid and exact                  
              separations of cell constituents, making pure samples available                
              for study within the time limit of a laboratory period. This makes             
              it possible for the students to explore the molecular mechanisms               
              of cell function by experimenting with purified components rather              
              than crude fractions obtained by lower-speed centrifugations. The              
              proposed exercises will help students understand how we have come              
              to understand the complex interactions that coordinate cell                    
              processes.  The college will contribute an amount equal to the                 
              award.
