Abstract    :
              The physics department is creating an upper division experimental              
              physics course for physics majors that will give each physics major            
              an opportunity to do experiments with up-to-date instrumentation               
              in the area of basic plasm physics and vacuum science.  The                    
              creation of such a course constitutes a major improvement in the               
              quality of the Physics Bachelor's Degree program.  The                         
              instrumentation includes a vacuum system built around a 325 1/s                
              diffusion pump.  Electronic equipment (Lockin Amplifier, Boxcar                
              Integrator & Computer Interface (GPIB) and electrostatic probes                
              (Langmuir Probes, Gridded Energy Analyzer) permit fundamental                  
              plasma parameter measurements, including plasma density and                    
              electrostatic potential, electron and ion temperature and                      
              distribution functions.  Ion acoustic wave, ion beam, and chaotic              
              dynamics experiments are being performed as well.  The                         
              instrumentation also includes a digital storage oscilliscope which             
              is integrated with an IBM PC/AT compatible computer for data                   
              acquisition and analysis.  Communications Software provides access             
              to the University's VAX computers for off line data analysis.                  
                                                                                             
              The University is matching the award with an equal amount of funds.
