Abstract    :
              A new diode-array ultraviolet/visible spectrophotometer and its                
              computer, computer peripherals, and application software has been              
              purchased. This instrument is substantially upgrading the quality and          
              variety of undergraduate laboratory experiences, and is giving                 
              students, for the first time, practise with a computer-controlled              
              instrument and its application software. The instrument is being used          
              in a number of undergraduate courses, including General Biology,               
              Ecology, Anatomy and Physiology, Cell Biology, Biochemistry, and               
              independent research. A varied spectrum of increasingly more                   
              sophisticated exercises are being incorporated into the students'              
              "hands-on" laboratory experiences. The university will contribute an           
              amount equal to the award.
