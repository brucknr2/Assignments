Abstract    :
                   This project modernizes and improves the program of energy                
              conversion required of all engineering technology majors.  The                 
              equipment acquired includes electrical power supplies and                      
              rotating machines with controls and an engine test cell complete               
              with printer and plotter.  This equipment greatly enhances the                 
              teaching of applied thermodynamics and rotating machines.  The                 
              equipment also provides opportunities for independent study                    
              activities.                                                                    
                                                                                             
                   The award is being matched by an equal amount from the                    
              principal investigator's institution.
