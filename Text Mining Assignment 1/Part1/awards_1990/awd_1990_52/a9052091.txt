Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to the Geography Department at Utah State            
              University to help purchase equipment for the establishment of a               
              Remote Sensing Teaching Lab for undergraduate training in digital              
              image processing and automated mapping.  This award will allow the             
              Principal Investigators to:  1.  Provide training in state-of-the-             
              art remote sensing and GIS software and hardware to USU                        
              undergraduates.  2.  Create laboratory exercise which stimulate the            
              development of new applications of remotely-sensed and GIS data                
              bases for resource management. 3.  Provide laboratory facilities               
              to encourage undergraduate development and interaction between                 
              disciplines.  and 4.  Improve undergraduate understanding of image             
              processing software logic and the students ability to create new               
              algorithms to address specific land management problems.  The                  
              grantee is matching this award with non-Federal sources.
