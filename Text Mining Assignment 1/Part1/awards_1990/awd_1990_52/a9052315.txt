Abstract    :
              Equipment is being purchased to integrate concepts of                          
              environmental sciences throughout the curriculum and develop                   
              students' analytical skills.  Beginning and advanced students                  
              conduct experiments that integrate field and laboratory                        
              experiences.  They measure responses of plants and animals to                  
              their environment and manipulate variables to test hypotheses.                 
              Students use a light sensor, leaf area/image analyzer, balances,               
              portable water quality lab, and portable hygrometer/thermometer                
              to measure important environmental parameters.  Environmental                  
              chambers and a refrigerated incubator allow students to control                
              temperature, light, and humidity to learn how environmental                    
              conditions affect essential physiological and ecological                       
              processes.  Approximately 200 students per year benefit during                 
              lab experiences in the first two biology courses.  Another 50-60               
              majors use the equipment in upper level courses, and will have                 
              the opportunity to use the modern equipment for independent                    
              research in environmental science.  The university will                        
              contribute an amount equal to the award.
