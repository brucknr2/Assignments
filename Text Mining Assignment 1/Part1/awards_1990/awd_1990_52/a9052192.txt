Abstract    :
              The project introduces into the physics laboratories three                     
              versatile laser systems, with electronic instrumentation and                   
              quality optical components.  The equipment (i) familiarizes                    
              intermediate lab students with important aspects of laser light;               
              (ii) permits advanced lab students to perform significant                      
              experiments in modern physics using lasers as research tools; (iii)            
              facilitates the teaching of modern optics principles and                       
              experimental techniques; and (iv) greatly expands the possibilities            
              for senior thesis research in optics.  A tunable dye laser pumped              
              by an argon ion laser permits new lab experiments in nonlinear                 
              optics and Raman scattering, while revitalizing several current                
              labs.  A diode laser system is used in spectroscopy and studies of             
              diode behavior.  Polarization components that comprise a high                  
              quality ellipsometer facilitate a variety of experiments in the                
              optics of thin films and scattering.  Senior research on chaos in              
              diode lasers and scattering from fiber-coupling spheres is expected            
              to yield important results of publishable quality.                             
                                                                                             
              The college is matching the award with an equal amount.
