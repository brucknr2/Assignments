Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to the Psychology Department at the                  
              University of Connecticut to purchase equipment which will help                
              improve the introductory psychology sequence at the University.                
              The school has already funded a pilot program (tested in General               
              Psychology 1) which provided some student computer stations, one               
              network file server and one instructor's station.  The pilot                   
              program extended control over stimulus presentation, data                      
              collection and data analysis.  New programs were written and                   
              existing programs modified to increase the range and complexity of             
              the experiments which formed the core of the labs.  This award will            
              allow the program to be expanded to give all students the                      
              opportunity to participate in the Computer Assisted Laboratory for             
              Introductory Psychology.  It will also enhance the pilot software              
              and develop new software to enrich the understanding of                        
              experimentation and increase the level of computer literacy of                 
              primarily freshman and sophomore students.  The grantee is matching            
              this award with non-Federal sources.
