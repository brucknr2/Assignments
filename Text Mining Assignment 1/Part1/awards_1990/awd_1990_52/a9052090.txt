Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The department of chemistry and physics has augmented the                      
              laboratory equipment for instrumental analysis, physical                       
              chemistry, and undergraduate research through the acquisition of               
              a polarograph and a microwave digestive system.   The                          
              instrumentation has enhanced the skills of students in the area                
              of electrochemical analysis by providing them with a technique to              
              determine trace concentrations of inorganic ions in solution and               
              electroactive organic species.  The microwave digestion system                 
              allows rapid sample preparation and introduces the students to                 
              another method of putting samples into solution.                               
                                                                                             
              The institution contributed to the project in an amount equal to               
              the NSF funds.
