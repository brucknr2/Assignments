Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The aim of this project was twofold:  to enhance spectroscopic                 
              capabilities afforded by the chemistry department for the                      
              education of chemistry and chemical engineering students, and to               
              develop and implement summer workshops for regional high school                
              science teacher to sharpen their knowledge, interest, and                      
              enthusiasm for chemical science so that they would function more               
              effectively in the classroom.                                                  
                                                                                             
              In this context, the institution acquired a nuclear magnetic                   
              resonance spectrometer to implement their aims.  The instrument                
              has been the focus for the development of:  new chemistry                      
              experiments for undergraduate students developed by five faculty               
              members and incorporated into existing laboratories, a new                     
              spectroscopy course which included other recently acquired                     
              instrumentation, increased opportunities for undergraduate                     
              research, and summer workshops for high school science teacher                 
              which included modern spectroscopic methods as an integral                     
              component.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              This project enhanced the quality of science education for the                 
              undergraduates and stimulated the interest of regional high                    
              school science teacher in the chemical science, an interest they               
              have transmitted to their students.                                            
                                                                                             
              The institution contributed to the project in an amount equal to               
              the NSF funds.
