Abstract    :
              This project develops a concurrent processing facility (a                      
              hypercube) for students in the Departments of Computer Science and             
              Mathematics.  This new laboratory supports courses and projects in             
              numerical methods by providing experience with Hypercube Topology,             
              Language Constructs, Utilities, Gaussian Elimination, Commun-                  
              ication Overhead, Perfect Parallelism and Load Balancing.  Key                 
              equipment includes an ensemble of 5 Apple Macintosh IIci computers             
              and AppleTalk.  This Mac-based hypercube is designed according to              
              the prototype developed at Caltech using LocalTalk hardware and                
              AppleTalk software as the medium for the nodal connections.  The               
              award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal                   
              investigator's institution.
