Abstract    :
              New laboratory exercises emphasizing electrophysiological methods              
              are being integrated into an introductory psychobiology course and             
              a senior seminar course in comparative/physiological psychology. The           
              exercises in the introductory course start from a basic understanding          
              of the recording equipment necessary to record data from the CNS. The          
              next series records the development of electrical potential across             
              a simulated biological membrane (dialysis tubing) vs real biological           
              membranes (frog skin and muscle), simulates an axon and voltage clamp          
              experiment, records the compound nerve potential of the frog nerve-            
              muscle preparation, and ends with recording intracellular muscle               
              potentials in the crayfish as a function of presynaptic excitation.            
              The senior seminar builds upon the above experiences. Students map             
              the motor cortex, record field potential from hippocampal tissue               
              slices, and record multi-unit activity of the hippocampus as a                 
              function of classical conditioning. These studies significantly                
              increase the qualitative level of instruction in psychobiology at the          
              university. The university will contribute an amount equal to 115%             
              of the award.
