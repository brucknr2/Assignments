Abstract    :
              This Schenectady County Community College project involved the                 
              enhancement of the chemistry laboratory curriculum by incorporating            
              more student hands-on use of computer-driven instruments for                   
              qualitative and quantitative experiments.  To accomplish this goal             
              the College proposed the acquisition of an FTIR spectrophotometer,             
              an atomic absorption spectrophotometer, and two microcomputer                  
              systems.  These additions, along with existing instruments, allowed            
              for:  (1)  an increase in the number of student applications using             
              state-of-the-art instruments and microcomputers; (2)  an increase              
              in the diversity of the applications performed by students; (3)                
              enhancement of the traditional techniques that students use for                
              qualitative and quantitative analysis; (4) improvement of the                  
              state-of-the-art of the equipment that students encounter; (5)                 
              enhancement of student capabilities with computers; and (6)                    
              introduction of a new instrumental analysis course as an elective              
              for students.  The institution contributed to this project in an               
              amount equal to the NSF funds.
