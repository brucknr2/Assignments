Abstract    :
              This project updates and improves the engineering technology                   
              thermofluids laboratory through the addition of a computerized data            
              acquisition system.  This equipment provides fifth-year mechanical             
              engineering technology and fourth-year energy engineering technology           
              students with "hands-on" experience in testing and analyzing fluid             
              flow, thermodynamic cycles, and heat transfer through new and existing         
              laboratory experiments.  The laboratory experience reinforces course           
              work in two fundamental courses, thermodynamics and fluid mechanics.           
              With this data acquisition equipment, the student has more time                
              evaluating and analyzing results such as is done in industry.  The             
              award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal                   
              investigator's institution.
