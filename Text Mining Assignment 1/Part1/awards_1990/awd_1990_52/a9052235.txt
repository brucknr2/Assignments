Abstract    :
                   The objective of this project is to improve a Simulation,                 
              Instrumentation, and Control Laboratory and the associated                     
              curriculum.  The College of Engineering employs this facility and              
              curriculum for instructing mechanical, chemical, aerospace, and                
              electrical engineers as well as students minoring in biomedical                
              and ocean engineering.  It is used annually by over 900 students               
              for core courses, senior electives, and senior projects                        
              including those which are sponsored by local industries.                       
                                                                                             
                   A modern distributed control system and computers for                     
              simulation have been purchased to add to the existing controllers              
              and sensors in the present laboratory.  The instruments will be                
              used by students to simulate, configure, and study multiple loop               
              and cascaded systems that have been beyond the capabilities of                 
              this facility in the past.  Computers and recorders are used to                
              analyze experimental results and display them graphically.  This               
              new laboratory equipment improves students comprehension and                   
              reduces learning time.  It also reduces the time students spend                
              on repetitive tasks such as manual data acquisition so that more               
              advanced topics and supplemental material can be covered in the                
              same course.                                                                   
                                                                                             
                   The award is being matched by an equal amount from the                    
              principal investigator's institution.
