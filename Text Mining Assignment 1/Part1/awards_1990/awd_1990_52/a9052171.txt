Abstract    :
              The psychology department is establishing a computer-based laboratory          
              to allow all students of psychology, beginning with the introductory           
              course, to design and conduct laboratory experiments and research. The         
              department emphasizes the scientific study of behavior throughout the          
              curriculum and offers well developed opportunities for research and            
              laboratory work in advanced courses. The aim of the project is to              
              increase students' understanding of and knowledge about the research           
              process. The new laboratory consists of computer-based work stations           
              with color monitors, networked together and programmed using Micro             
              Experimental Laboratory developmental software. The laboratory allows a        
              class to develop a hypothesis, design an experiment, collect and               
              analyze data, and discuss results, sometimes within a single laboratory        
              period. This gives students a tool which will enable them to actually          
              ask questions and answer them using the methods of scientists, rather          
              than just studying about or replicating research of others. The college        
              will contribute an amount equal to the award.
