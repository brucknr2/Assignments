Abstract    :
              Limited laboratory time in the Anatomy and Physiology course is                
              being maximized by using computer-interfaced equipment and                     
              instituting experiments that can be performed on the students                  
              themselves.  Three physiology packages, the physiogrip, the                    
              cardiocomp, and the spirocomp, which interface with personal                   
              computers are used to perform exercises on muscle, cardiac, and                
              respiratory physiology.  Using the computer to store and analyze               
              data may help students with mathematical deficiencies, sustain                 
              interest in physiology, and give the students more time for                    
              discussion and comprehension of the data.  The experiences gained              
              with this new equipment will become the basis for seminars for                 
              high school and junior college teachers and for the development                
              of a laboratory test bank.  The university will contribute an                  
              amount equal to the award.
