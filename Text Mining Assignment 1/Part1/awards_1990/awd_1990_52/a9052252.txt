Abstract    :
              This is a proposal to upgrade the equipment of a small religious               
              liberal arts college by the purchase of several significant pieces             
              of physics equipment.  It is also proposed to share this equipment             
              with other laboratories at the institution and with another small              
              state university in the same city.//
