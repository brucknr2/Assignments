Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to increase the number of female and               
              minority inner-city high school students entering higher                       
              educational engineering programs.  This undertaking is the result              
              of concern about the low entry rate of women and minority members              
              into the study of college science and engineering.  Through                    
              previous outreach work 223 high school freshman and sophomores have            
              gained awareness of engineering career options and strengthened                
              their science and mathematics skills.  This experience has                     
              indicated that while participants are more knowledgeable and                   
              enthusiastic about entering engineering, their academic achievement            
              in the prerequisite science and mathematics falls short in most                
              cases.                                                                         
                                                                                             
              This project seeks to improve upon this past experience by matching            
              the teaching methodology more closely to the program population.               
              Its solution appears to be in providing the inner city teenagers               
              with an instructional approach that is interactive, visually                   
              oriented and individualized.  Having succeeded in capturing the                
              interest of these students and in making them aware of their                   
              personal potential, this engineering exploratory computer                      
              laboratory enables them to attain the academic levels in science               
              and mathematics necessary to realize their ambitions.                          
                                                                                             
              The award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal               
              investigator's institution.
