Abstract    :
              The quality of undergraduate education in Computer Integrated                  
              Manufacturing (CIM) is enhanced by the acquisition of state-of-                
              the-art laboratory equipment that demonstrates and stimulates                  
              experimentation with every relevant computer integrated                        
              manufacturing concept.  The equipment will be used to support                  
              engineering education improvements in design, experimentation,                 
              manufacturing and computer integration of the enterprise.                      
                                                                                             
              This project is significant and of vital importance because it                 
              will enable undergraduate students to perform laboratory                       
              experiments within the context of a computer integrated                        
              manufacturing environment while acquiring training in robotics,                
              vision systems, computer numerically controlled machines,                      
              automated material handling, instrumentation, microprocessor                   
              applications, computer networking, and office automation.                      
              Twenty-one courses involving eight full-time faculty in                        
              mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and industrial                 
              engineering will utilize the laboratory to improve the quality                 
              and quantity of Computer Integrated Manufacturing instruction in               
              undergraduate engineering education.
