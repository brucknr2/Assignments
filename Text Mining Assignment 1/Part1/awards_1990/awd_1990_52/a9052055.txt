Abstract    :
              The physics department is significantly modifying and improving its            
              advanced physics laboratory by introducing new experiments which               
              integrate materials science and new technology concepts presented in           
              lecture courses, use modern equipment, and employ computer                     
              interfacing.  The new experiments are grouped in three areas: Thin             
              Film Technology, Ultrasonics, and Modern Optics.  Many of the new              
              experiments are interfaced to computers so that computer control of            
              both equipment and experiments is an essential component.  This                
              laboratory enables students to perform timely experiments using                
              techniques that are similar to those being used at the research and            
              technological forefront.  The university is matching the award with            
              an equal amount of funds.
