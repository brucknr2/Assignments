Abstract    :
              This interdisciplinary project will introduce a variety of laser               
              experiments in upper level chemistry and physics courses.  Laser-              
              based methods are at the heart of modern studies of atomic and                 
              molecular phenomena, and experience in this area is becoming an                
              essential part of the education of undergraduate students in physics           
              and physical chemistry.  This project has been preceded by a three-            
              year program which has included faculty development, construction of           
              a scanning pulsed dye laser system, and introduction of a new course           
              on laser physics.  The project greatly improves Earlham's laboratory           
              capabilities by providing a large number of optical components,                
              several important measuring instruments, and a tunable diode laser             
              subsystem.  The equipment is being used in eleven experiments                  
              covering topics in atomic and molecular physics, spectroscopy and              
              laser optics.  It is also being used by junior and senior students             
              in Independent Study courses.  The college will match the award with           
              an equal amount of funds.//
