Abstract    :
                   This project will support the purchase of workstations and                
              software to improve instruction in upper division mathematics and              
              applied mathematics courses.  It is being funded under the                     
              Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement (ILI) Program, which                
              has the goal of supporting projects to develop new or improved                 
              instrument-based undergraduate laboratory courses in science,                  
              mathematics, or engineering.  The Instrumentation and Laboratory               
              Improvement Program provides matching support for the instrumen-               
              tation necessary to implement undergraduate instructional                      
              improvements at U.S. colleges and universities.                                
                   In particular, the main objective of this project is to                   
              provide upper division students in several courses with powerful,              
              user friendly mathematical software which combines numerical,                  
              symbolic, and graphics capabilities in one package.  The students              
              will be able to experiment with recently learned ideas, and to                 
              visualize solutions to problems they have worked.
