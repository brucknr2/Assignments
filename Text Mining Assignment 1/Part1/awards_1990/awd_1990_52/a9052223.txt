Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry will acquire three gas                             
              chromatographs and a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer.                      
              These instruments will be utilized in a series of undergraduate                
              laboratories in order to demonstrate state-of-the-art                          
              analytical equipment for the separation and analysis of complex                
              chemical mixtures.  The students will obtain hands-on                          
              experience in the use of this equipment in the following                       
              laboratory courses: Freshman Chemistry Laboratory for majors,                  
              Sophomore Organic Chemistry Laboratories for both majors and                   
              nonmajors, Instrumental Analysis, and Advanced Synthesis                       
              Laboratory.  Students taking Undergraduate Research in the                     
              fields of organic and analytical chemistry will make extensive                 
              use of the instrumentation.
