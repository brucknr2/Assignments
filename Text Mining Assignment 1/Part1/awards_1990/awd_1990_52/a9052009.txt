Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry at the institution integrated Gas                  
              Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) into its curriculum.  The             
              department acquired a Finnigan MAT Model 804A GC-MS system which               
              features an ion trap detector and allows both electron impact and              
              chemical ionization of samples.  The instrument is controlled by               
              a menu driven IBM-PC compatible computer and permits library                   
              searching of mass spectra.  The department previously lacked any               
              capability in mass spectrometry.  The instrument is fully                      
              integrated into the organic chemistry courses in the curriculum and            
              has been incorporated into two additional courses.  The project                
              provides students with hands-on experience with an instrument that             
              has become standard technology in many academic, industrial, and               
              commercial laboratories.  The project provides the first entry into            
              instrumentation which combines two analytical methods in one                   
              system.  The education of at least 400 science majors over the next            
              five years will be enhanced by the project.  The institution                   
              contributed to this project in a amount equal to the NSF funds.
