Abstract    :
              Digital signal processing chips (DSPs) have recently appeared in               
              many products.  Also, computer-aided design (CAD) workstations are             
              increasing engineering productivity while, at the same time,                   
              altering the way the engineering designs.  Today's electrical                  
              engineers should be familiar with DSP hardware, software, and                  
              related CAD tools.  A DSP laboratory facility is proposed that will            
              permit students to practice both software and "chip-level" DSP-                
              based hardware design using modern CAD tools.  This facility will              
              serve students in three ways:  (1)  It will support a new DSP                  
              project course, (2) it will permit the assignment of basic DSP                 
              simulation homework in the existing DSP theory course, and (3) it              
              will support DSP-related senior design projects.  This facility                
              will consist of ten DSP workstations.  Each workstation includes:              
              (1) a Zenith 80386-based personal computer, (2) a DSP board that               
              plugs into the PC, (3) associated CAD tools, and (4) a reusable                
              hardware design prototyping kit.  The unique features of our                   
              approach are:  (1) the use of CAD tools (2) the emphaise on "chip-             
              level" hardware design as well as software design, and (3) the                 
              interdisciplinary manner in which we propose to structure the                  
              student project teams.  The institution is contributing an amount              
              equal to the award.***//
