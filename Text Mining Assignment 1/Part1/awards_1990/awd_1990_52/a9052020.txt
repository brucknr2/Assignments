Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project was designed to upgrade the undergraduate chemistry               
              curriculum at the institution.  The objectives were to expand the              
              laboratory program in chemistry in the upper level courses and to              
              provide more equipment with which to carry out student oriented                
              research projects.  The project forms an integral part of the                  
              University plan to emphasize the sciences on the campus.                       
                                                                                             
              The specific activities of the project involved two specific                   
              areas, namely (1) the acquisition of new equipment to expand the               
              range of laboratory experiments available and (2) the expansion                
              of the research program.                                                       
                                                                                             
              The main outcomes of the project are an improvement in the basic               
              undergraduate curriculum in chemistry through an improvement in                
              the resources that are available to the student.  The improvement              
              results in a better prepared graduate of the University who in                 
              turn is be better able to compete at the professional level after              
              graduation.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              The institution contributed to the project in an amount slightly               
              in excess of the NSF funds.
