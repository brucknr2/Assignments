Abstract    :
              Microscopes and optic illuminators are being purchased for use by              
              undergraduate students in an archaeology laboratory studying                   
              microscopic wear patterns on stone artifacts. The objective is to              
              enable students to discriminate different functional uses of stone             
              tools based on microwear polish and striations found on artifact               
              working edges. The acquisition of this equipment upgrades previously           
              available instruments, and provides students with the means to                 
              undertake comparative analyses of microscopic wear patterns on                 
              artifacts used in the same task. The equipment is also used to study           
              under magnification marks made on bone to differentiate those caused by        
              natural agencies, such as trampling or gnawing, from those caused by           
              stone artifacts in the process of butchering. The university will              
              contribute an amount equal to the award.
