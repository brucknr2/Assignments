Abstract    :
              This project improves the Electromechanics Laboratory in the                   
              Electrical Engineering Department.  This is achieved by the                    
              acquisition and construction of equipment for the study of modern              
              prime movers as found in computer peripherals, robotics, and percision         
              motion equipment.  Experiments characertize step, voice-coil, and              
              brushless DC motors.  This provides the students with an opportunity to        
              obtain a solid "feel" for the fundamentals governing these motors while        
              acquainting them with devices highly relevant to their future careers.         
              This award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal              
              investigator's institution.
