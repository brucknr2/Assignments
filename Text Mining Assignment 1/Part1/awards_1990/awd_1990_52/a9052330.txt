Abstract    :
              The curriculum of the Chemistry Department has been strengthened               
              by the acquisition of an atomic absorption spectrometer in the                 
              following ways:  (1) students from several academic disciplines                
              gain first-had knowledge of an important analytical technique; (2)             
              a critical assessment of the data obtained is made part of the                 
              experiment; (3) new experiments have been implemented which not                
              only illustrate scientific principles but also relate to current               
              problems of the environment; and (4) experiments previously in use             
              are done more efficiently.  The instrumentation is used by students            
              in their second semester of freshmen chemistry as well as Physical             
              and Inorganic Chemistry, Instrumental Methods of Analysis, and                 
              Undergraduate Research.                                                        
                                                                                             
              The institution contributed to this project in an amount equal to              
              the NSF funds.
