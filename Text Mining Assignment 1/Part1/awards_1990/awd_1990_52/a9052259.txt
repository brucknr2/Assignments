Abstract    :
                   The equipment purchased herewith will be used in a series                 
              of undergraduate physics laboratories for data acquisition and                 
              analysis.  In the first year, several experiments in classical                 
              mechanics, mechanical waves, and optics, for the introductory                  
              laboratories, will be enhanced.  The project will then be                      
              extended to include a variety of upper level experiments in                    
              optics, electronics, modern physics, and possibly classical                    
              electricity and magnetism, for physics and physics/engineering                 
              majors.  Some of these experiments will also be used in an                     
              introductory computer interfacing course for non-science                       
              majors.
