Abstract    :
              This project is upgrading the laboratory component for introductory            
              physics classes.  Since the faculty of Rosary College revised the              
              curriculum of 1987, a surprising number of non-science majors are              
              selecting the courses of Meteorology, the Physics of Music, Energy-            
              Urban Supply and Demand, and even General Physics to satisfy the one           
              semester science course requirement.  To meet the challenge presented          
              by these students often suffering from mathematics anxiety and with            
              little previous science background, the faculty of the Natural                 
              Science Department is designing new experiments, including                     
              interfacing some equipment with computers.  The students will come             
              to the classes with some previous computer experience and by                   
              improving data gathering, the laboratory results should be more                
              consistent thereby making science methods more comprehensible.  With           
              the addition of a satellite dish and a digitized observational                 
              weather station, the meteorology and energy classes are using state-           
              of-the-art methods, and, through study of this information , students          
              obtain a better understanding of their everyday world.  For the                
              students in Physics of Musics and General Physics, the addition of             
              a musical synthesizer and wave analyzer capable of interfacing with            
              a computer improves data gathering in standard experiments and adds            
              new possibilities of synthesizing and analyzing live music.  This              
              computerized instrumentation impact on the lectures with the                   
              capability of better and more pertinent audiovisuals.  The college             
              is matching the award with an equal amount of funds.
