Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The quality of undergraduate education in the scientific process               
              has been enhanced through the acquisition of routine gas                       
              chromatograph/mass spectrometers for use in courses which service              
              chemistry majors, premedical students and non-science majors.                  
              The primary us of the instrumentation is in the two semester                   
              organic chemistry course.  Instead of first learning reaction                  
              details in lecture with subsequent verification in the                         
              laboratory, students are first guided to predict major reaction                
              products (often based on results from molecular mechanics                      
              calculations), conduct the reaction (representative of that                    
              introduced in lecture without mechanistic detail) and observe                  
              trends in product formation.  In most instances, each student                  
              executes experiments under slightly  different conditions; the                 
              class results are pooled and displayed with a computer projection              
              system by the instructor.  Students participate as a group in the              
              analysis and discussion of their results to formulate and test                 
              plausible mechanisms.  Utilization of instrumentation in this                  
              "discovery" approach promotes true student involvement in the                  
              study of organic chemistry, increases interest in the discipline               
              and thus betters chances of attracting and retaining chemistry                 
              majors.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              The school contributed to this project in an amount equal to the               
              NSF funds.
