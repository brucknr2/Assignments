Abstract    :
              A new ultracentrifuge, a density gradient former, and a gradient               
              fractionator with ultraviolet monitor and strip chart recorder have            
              been purchased and are being used to prepare, fractionate and analyze          
              plasmic, viral, bacterial, and eukaryotic DNA, as well as to isolate           
              chloroplast membrane systems, nuclei, chromatin, and other subcellular         
              components. Ultracentrifugation is being incorporated as lecture-              
              demonstrations in the introductory biology course, where concepts such         
              as semi-conservative replication are discussed. Significant student            
              contact with the instruments progress in stages through selected               
              intermediate level courses, and culminate in senior honors research            
              projects for some students. The university is contributing an amount           
              equal to the award.
