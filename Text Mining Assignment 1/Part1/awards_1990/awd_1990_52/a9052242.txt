Abstract    :
                   This project will support the establishment of a computer                 
              laboratory that will be used in conjunction with a two-semester                
              introductory calculus sequence. It is being funded under the                   
              Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement (ILI) Program, which                
              has the goal of supporting projects to develop new or improved                 
              instrument-based undergraduate laboratory courses in science,                  
              mathematics, or engineering.  The Instrumentation and Laboratory               
              Improvement Program provides matching support for the instrumen-               
              tation necessary to implement undergraduate instructional                      
              improvements at U.S. colleges and universities.                                
                  In particular, the main objective of this project is to                    
              provide the laboratory environment which will facilitate the use               
              of the system called the Calculus Companion, written by the                    
              Principal Investigators under a previous NSF grant.  The                       
              computer, with the Calculus Companion, will enable students to                 
              concentrate on learning the important concepts of calculus, free               
              them from tedious calculations, and encourage creativity through               
              rapid feedback and experimentation.
