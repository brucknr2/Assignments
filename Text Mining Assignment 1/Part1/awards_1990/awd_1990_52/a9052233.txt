Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The acquisition of a multi-nuclei, variable temperature Fourier                
              transform nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer has been                     
              essential for the joined Departments of Chemistry at the                       
              institution and the College of Mount St. Vincent.  The instrument              
              bridges the gap between undergraduate training and graduate                    
              research and inaugurated a new era in the teaching of chemistry                
              to the students.  Emphasis on (13)C-NMR, using COSY, HETCOR and                
              2D pulse techniques is an integral part of modern NMR                          
              spectroscopy.  FT-NMR enables students to use smaller amounts of               
              chemicals, complementing semimicroscale procedures previously                  
              adopted in the organic laboratory.  Skills such as recording and               
              interpreting spectral data are complemented by the concepts                    
              learned in advanced physical, analytical and instrumental                      
              chemistry.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              Research is an integral part of the undergraduate curriculum; a                
              high field FT-NMR is essential for modern research in chemistry.               
              The acquisition of such an instrument is supporting the recently               
              instituted program in nuclear medicine technology.                             
                                                                                             
              The institution is contributing to the project in an amount in                 
              excess of $7,000 over the NSF funds.
