Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This program addresses a need in chemical engineering curicula to              
              address polymer materials, and is designed to complement the                   
              existing fundamental polymer science course.  Practical                        
              laboratory experiments including thermal analysis and surface                  
              science form the nucleus of state-of-the-art physical                          
              characterization techniques for undergraduate experimentation on               
              classic homopolymers, elastomers, and fiber-reinforced                         
              composites.  Underlying fundamental concepts developed in lecture              
              are linked with practical laboratory measurements.  The curricula              
              is intended for students in chemistry, chemical engineering,                   
              mechanical engineering, and materials science.
