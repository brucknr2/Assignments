Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry will acquire a Scanning Tunneling                  
              Microscope (STM) for undergraduate education.  The project                     
              intends the incorporation of STM into the junior and senior                    
              years of the undergraduate chemistry curriculum at the                         
              University of Miami.  STM is a conceptually and instrumentally                 
              simple technique which has developed from an esoteric research                 
              topic at the beginning of this decade to a highly useful tool                  
              in the field of surface science at present.  STM is capable of                 
              generating surface images with atomic resolution and thus                      
              affords the direct observation of individual atoms.  STM can                   
              also be utilized for microscopic purposes competing                            
              advantageously with Transmission Electron Microscopy and                       
              Scanning Electron Microscopy.  STM instruments are completely                  
              computerized and easy to use.  This technique will be used to                  
              introduce undergraduate students to the growing field of                       
              surface chemistry.  This project will pioneer the incorporation                
              of STM into upper level chemistry laboratories in undergraduate                
              courses of Instrumental Analysis and Physical Chemistry.
