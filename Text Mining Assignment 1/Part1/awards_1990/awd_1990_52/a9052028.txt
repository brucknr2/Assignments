Abstract    :
              Psychology majors at Fort Lewis College have previously shown little           
              interest in independent research or pursuing careers in psychological          
              research. This is believed to be due, in part, to poorly equipped              
              laboratories in two Core courses required of majors, Foundations of            
              Experimental Psychology and Topics in Research. There have not been            
              enough pieces of equipment to conduct well-supervised laboratories, and        
              there have not been computers available for data collection and                
              analysis. These deficiencies are being corrected by equipping the              
              laboratory associated with these two courses with Macintosh computers          
              and appropriate software for running a variety of experiments.                 
              Modernizing the laboratory in this manner enables students to                  
              concentrate on acquiring research concepts, experimental design                
              techniques, statistical and graphical analysis skills with little of           
              the frustration and time associated with the use of the previous               
              outdated system. The college will contribute an amount equal to the            
              award.
