Abstract    :
              Modern methods of data acquisition and analysis are being provided             
              to undergraduate physiology laboratories. This equipment is not only           
              enhancing existing laboratory experiments, but is also increasing the          
              number of experiments performed while providing quantifiable data and          
              access to software commonly used in scientific analysis.                       
              Physiological transducers are attached to a commercially available             
              data acquisition system that is connected to a personal computer.              
              Each system enables two student groups to utilize one computer                 
              system. Software simulations and mathematical models are also used             
              to enhance comprehension. The integration of computer-based                    
              acquisition equipment should reduce the frustration level that many            
              students experienced with the previous equipment. The university will          
              contribute an amount equal to the award.
