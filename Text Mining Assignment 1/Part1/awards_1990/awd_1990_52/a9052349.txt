Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer and related                   
              sampling accessories were acquired through this project in order               
              to implement an instructional project which has yielded "across                
              the board" improvements in undergraduate chemistry instruction at              
              the institution.  This project involved the design and                         
              implementation of experiments utilizing the FTIR and its data                  
              station for both upper and lower level courses.  The work                      
              enhanced the quality of undergraduate instruction in three way,                
              namely by (1) serving as a vehicle for teaching advanced                       
              instrumental concepts such as analog-digital relations and                     
              software data manipulation, (2) providing students hands-on                    
              experience with a modern, computerized instrument commonly                     
              encountered in academic and industrial postgraduate settings, and              
              (3) motivating underclassmen to purse chemistry as their major                 
              field of study by exposing them to the "state of the art" in                   
              infrared analysis.                                                             
                                                                                             
              The institution contributed to this project in an amount equal to              
              the NSF funds.
