Abstract    :
              This project improves the Electronics Engineering Technology                   
              Department's ability to provide course work consistent with                    
              industry demands placed upon program graduates.  The ever                      
              increasing amount of automated test equipment in the production                
              environment requires an appropriate education of those charged with            
              the test responsibilities.  This requires the integration of basic             
              principles with laboratory reinforcement.                                      
                                                                                             
              The area of focus is a three term sequence of courses with both                
              classroom and laboratory experience.  This sequence is an                      
              alternative to an independent study senior project where the                   
              student the student develops his own project and implements the                
              design.  This option is directed at areas recommended by industry              
              and involves equipment utilizing both GPIB and VIX automated test              
              equipment having all the functions necessary to teach the                      
              principles and practice of Test Engineering.                                   
                                                                                             
              The award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal               
              investigator's institution.
