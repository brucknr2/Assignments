Abstract    :
              This project modernizes the content of several courses in                      
              Engineering Technology.  Specifically affected are the AC and DC               
              Machines sequence and the Process Controls Course.  The objective              
              is to expose students to modern state of the art methods and                   
              equipment for performing data acquisition and control functions.               
              The project equipment includes two complete data acquisition and               
              control systems that interface with previously owned equipment and             
              consists of two personal computers with data acquisition and                   
              control software, variable frequency drives, and other                         
              miscellaneous interfacing hardware.  These make possible new                   
              laboratory experiences that significantly enhance the education of             
              both associate degree and bachelors degree graduates in electrical             
              engineering technology.                                                        
                                                                                             
              The award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal               
              investigator's institution.
