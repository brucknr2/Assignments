Abstract    :
              The purchase of computers and related equipment (drives, monitors and          
              printer) and several physiology packages (the Body Electric and                
              Intellitool) involving hardware and software, are improving the                
              laboratory exercises in introductory courses at this community college.        
              The packages interface with the computers and allow the students the           
              use of modern physiological measuring and recording instruments. The           
              new equipment allows the laboratory portions of the courses to be              
              taught in a manner that  provides students with a creative, interactive        
              experience while stressing scientific method and fundamental concepts          
              in the field. The project significantly enhances the Anatomy and               
              Physiology course as well as other introductory courses. The college           
              will contribute an amount equal to the award.
