Abstract    :
              This project enables mechanical engineering students to conduct                
              ultra-high temperature experiments.  The equipment purchased includes          
              an electric furnace capable of reaching 1950 K, and a data                     
              acquisition system for recording and processing experimental data.             
              The laboratory improves the offering in materials science by                   
              permitting the study of the mechanical properties of ceramics.  It             
              also allows students in Heat Power Design and Senior Independent               
              Courses to consider potential processes that use high temperature              
              solar energy as a substitute for those that currently consume                  
              conventional fossil fuels.  Students experimentally investigate                
              chemical reactions adaptable to such processes. The experience with            
              ceramics heightens undergraduate students' awareness of materials              
              other than just conventional steel and nonferrous alloys.  It further          
              serves to illustrate chemical reactions that may become a part of              
              pioneering processes while increasing interest in energy and                   
              environmental research. The award is being matched by an equal amount          
              from the principal investigator's institution.
