Abstract    :
              A new laboratory course in Molecular and Cellular Biology is being             
              developed, in which students use some of the major techniques employed         
              in modern biology. The laboratory exercises present the techniques in          
              the context of biological investigation, rather than as isolated               
              demonstrations. The equipment purchased includes UV-Vis                        
              spectrophotometers, chromatographic equipment, horizontal and vertical         
              gel apparatus, ultracentrifuge rotors, and DNA sequencing apparatus.           
              Use of these items gives students useful skills and teaches them the           
              importance of the associated techniques in biological research. This           
              project should have a significant impact on the quality of the                 
              graduates, making them better prepared for graduate school, medical            
              school, or employment in research laboratories or biotechnology                
              companies. The university will contribute an amount equal to the award.
