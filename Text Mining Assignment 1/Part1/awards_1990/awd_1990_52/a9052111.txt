Abstract    :
              Inductively coupled plasma emission spectroscopy (ICP-ES) has become           
              the method of choice for elemental analysis of a wide range of                 
              chemical, environmental, and geological samples.  The wide dynamic             
              range, speed of analysis, and ease of operation of the technique               
              makes ICP-ES an excellent choice for general elemental analysis by             
              undergraduates.  This project establishes a multidisciplinary ICP-             
              ES facility to strengthen already strong programs in Chemistry,                
              Ecology, Environmental Science, and Geology.  The ICP-ES equipment             
              provides students with an opportunity to learn the operating                   
              principles of this important analytical technique and to apply the             
              instrument's analysis capability to environmental and laboratory               
              problems.  The grantee provides funds for this project that are an             
              equal match for the NSF award.
