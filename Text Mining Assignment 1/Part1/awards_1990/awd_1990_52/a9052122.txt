Abstract    :
              Beaver College is integrating molecular biology and biotechnology              
              across the curriculum so that every student will have adequate                 
              background to understand developments in modern biology, medicine, and         
              biotechnology. Electrophoresis and high speed centrifugation equipment         
              enable students to gain experience in molecular biology in the                 
              introductory biology and in the  interdisciplinary science courses             
              taken by every student. The equipment is also being incorporated into          
              teaching methods courses taken by elementary and secondary school              
              teachers. Students use electrophoresis to explore the relationship             
              between genes and gene products, and to understand how it can be used          
              to demonstrate relationships among organisms. Students in upper level          
              biology courses also use the equipment, along with more sophisticated          
              electrophoretic and blotting techniques, protein purification and              
              characterization, gene cloning, amplification, and screening, to extend        
              their knowledge of molecular biology and biotechnology. The college            
              will contribute an amount equal to the award.
