Abstract    :
              This project address the need for effective computer integrated                
              manufacturing (CIM) and flexible manufacturing systems (FMS)                   
              education within the Industrial and Mechanical Engineering                     
              Departments.  The goal of the undertaking is to provide laboratory             
              experiences that will educate graduates in ways of making                      
              industrial manufacturing more competitive for the global                       
              marketplace.  The project impacts eight Industrial Engineering and             
              Mechanical Engineering courses.  The award is being matched by an              
              equal amount from the principal investigator's institution.
