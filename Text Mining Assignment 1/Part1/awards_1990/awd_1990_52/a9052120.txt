Abstract    :
              The physiologically-oriented courses in the Departments of Psychology          
              and Biology are being significantly improved through the purchase of           
              instruments. Stereotaxic equipment (stereotaxic instrument, drill,             
              lesion making device, and automated microsyringe) is used to manipulate        
              precise locations in the brains of rats to determine relationships             
              between neuroanatomy, physiology, and behavior. The operant-                   
              conditioning apparatus is used to demonstrate principles of learning,          
              drug effects on learned behaviors, and rewarding brain stimulation.            
              Computerized physiological work stations are used to teach                     
              physiological recording techniques as well as principles of neural and         
              muscular physiology. This equipment allows for needed support in the           
              basic sciences and will prepare students for a wider range of career           
              options. The college will contribute an amount equal to the award.
