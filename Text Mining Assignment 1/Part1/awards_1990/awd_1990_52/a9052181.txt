Abstract    :
              Western Nevada Community College, a rural school, is providing its             
              students with state-of-the-art instruments in laboratory instruction.          
              These instruments use computer interfaces and software that allows for         
              detailed visualization of tissue, cell, and molecular samples from             
              biological sources. Physiological equipment gives the students the             
              opportunity to experiment with physiological variables such as                 
              respiration and cardiac activity. The UV-Visible spectrophotometer             
              allows for the analysis of biological materials such as plant pigment          
              extracts, and is interfaced with a computer for graphic portrayal. The         
              project has a great impact on students who will enter the work force in        
              fields such as nursing, agriculture, medicine, and nutrition in which          
              this expertise will be important. The college is contributing 104% of          
              the award.
