Abstract    :
              This project is increasing student participation in experimental               
              psychology by having students experience many important                        
              experiments as subjects, as experimenters, and as data analysts.               
              The addition of six computers to the lab enhances participation                
              as subjects at the introductory levels. At the upper division                  
              level, students are involved in designing and implementing                     
              experiments, and in statistical analysis of data from experiments              
              addressing contemporary issues in psychology. Many experimental                
              psychologists now use computers to display stimuli and record                  
              responses, and statistical analysis of data is also largely                    
              computer-based. Improvements in software now permit more students              
              to learn to set up their own experiments for course projects and               
              honors research. The aim is for students to see experimentation                
              as a part of their experience in psychology, thus enhancing the                
              teaching and learning of content areas, methodology, and                       
              statistics. The university will contribute an amount equal to the              
              award.
