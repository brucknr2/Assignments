Abstract    :
              A prototype "ANEX" facility is now available which permits                     
              students to compare Analytical and Experimental results of small-              
              scale structural model tests in a personal computer-controlled                 
              environment.  Also, a computerized "RED" facility is being                     
              developed to improve student skills related to the Reading and                 
              Interpretation of Engineering Drawings.  Resources are provided                
              to acquire the necessary equipment to produce four replicates of               
              the ANEX/RED facility so that they can be deployed successfully                
              for undergraduate laboratory instruction in structural                         
              engineering.
