Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The aim of this project is a significant increase in the quality               
              and timeliness of science education offered at California                      
              Polytechnic State University.  The project is providing a bridge               
              between the discipline gaps in biochemistry, organic chemistry                 
              physical chemistry and polymer chemistry by incorporating a High               
              Resolution Fourier Transform Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (FT-NMR)               
              Spectrometer into the Chemistry Department.  FT-NMR is an                      
              important instrumental technique which is widely used in all                   
              areas of chemistry, materials science, biology and medicine.                   
              This instrument is being used routinely for teaching purposes in               
              sophomore, junior and senior courses, where modern NMR                         
              experiments can be incorporated into the curricula to educate                  
              students, develop their powers of critical thinking, and                       
              encourage them to pursue careers in science.  The instrument is                
              also enabling undergraduate student to carry out meaningful                    
              individual research projects with faculty advisors in each of the              
              above mentioned areas.  The project is having a major impact on                
              the vitality and productivity of the Chemistry Department.                     
                                                                                             
              The University is contributing in excess of 300% of the NSF                    
              funds.
