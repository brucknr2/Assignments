Abstract    :
              Colgate University is providing students with an opportunity to                
              examine the nervous system at the biochemical level.  The project              
              is having an impact on the Neuroscience curriculum on two levels.              
              First, the project is providing equipment for a laboratory section             
              that enables juniors and seniors to learn basic biochemical                    
              methodology.  The students isolate and characterize subcellular                
              fractions from central nervous system tissue.  The fractions are               
              analyzed for biochemical markers (enzymatic activity), by SDS-                 
              polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblots, and for lipids.            
              At the second level, the students are designing senior thesis                  
              projects that address problems at the biochemical level utilizing              
              the equipment in the project.  Two specialized pieces of equipment             
              are being used.  The first is a system that runs, stains, and                  
              destains SDS-polyacrylamide gels in 1 hr.  In addition, transfer               
              of polypetides to nitrocellulose in preparation for immunoblot                 
              analysis is accomplished in 15 min.  The second is a                           
              spectrophotometer equipped with 6 wells to allow for the                       
              simulataneous acquisition of kinetic data from 6 samples.  The                 
              project brings to the Neuroscience curriculum fundamental methods              
              and techniques for the examination of the biochemical properties               
              of the nervous system.                                                         
                                                                                             
              The university is matching the award with an equal amount of funds.
