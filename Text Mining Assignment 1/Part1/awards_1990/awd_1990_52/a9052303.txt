Abstract    :
              Laser disks are being used as a basis for computerized interactive             
              multimedia exercises that will supplement traditional lecture and              
              laboratory experiences, and will encourage students to develop creative        
              and critical thinking skills and to become actively involved in                
              scientific reasoning. A statistical program is also being purchased in         
              order for the students to analyze quantitative data. This allows an            
              extension of their scientific reasoning skills. The university will            
              contribute an amount equal to the award.
