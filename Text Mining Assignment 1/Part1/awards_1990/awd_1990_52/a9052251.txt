Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Electronic imaging sensors called charge-coupled-devices (CCDs)                
              will be used to replace the photographic techniques and the single-            
              channel electronic devices currently used in an                                
              undergraduate course of Observational Techniques in Astronomy.                 
              This change will accomplish three important educational goals: 1)              
              it will afford the students a more realistic data collection                   
              experience, using the kinds of detectors commonly employed in                  
              modern optical astronomy, 2) it will extend the useful life of our             
              on-campus telescope by combating the effects of the increased                  
              brightness of the night sky, and 3) it will allow students to                  
              explore the analytical techniques of image analysis which find                 
              widespread use not only in all parts of astronomy but in most other            
              sciences as well.                                                              
                                                                                             
              Two scientific-grade CCD imaging camera systems and the                        
              accompanying data acquisition and reduction computers will be                  
              purchased.  The cameras will be used on two teaching telescopes on             
              campus; a solar telescope and a 12-inch refracting night-time                  
              telescope.  On the solar telescope, students will acquire time-                
              lapse images of prominences and of active regions on the sun                   
              through a narrow-band hydrogen filter.  On the night-time                      
              telescope, students will acquire images of star clusters and of                
              variable stars to gain experience in the techniques of broad-band              
              stellar photometry.
