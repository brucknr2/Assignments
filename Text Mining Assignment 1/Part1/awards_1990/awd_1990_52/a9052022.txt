Abstract    :
              Students are discovering the principles and concepts of calculus by            
              using a computer laboratory equipped with networked MacIntosh                  
              computers running Mathematica. The graphics, symbolic manipulation,            
              and computational capability of the software is also used for                  
              experimentation and discovery in differential equations and linear             
              algebra. The institution will contribute an amount equal to the                
              award.
