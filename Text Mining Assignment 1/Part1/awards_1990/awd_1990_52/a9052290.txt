Abstract    :
              Mankato State University is using a CCD camera system and                      
              associated computer equipment to support photometric and                       
              astrometric applications.  The camera is being used with a new                 
              high-quality 20-inch astronomical telescope in a new observatory               
              building.  This instrumentation is being used to teach students teh            
              applications of equipment and techiques used in astronomical                   
              research.  Class projects include subjects as fundamental and                  
              diverse as trigonometric parallax, cluster color-magnitude                     
              diagrams, cluster luminosity functions, asteroid orbits and                    
              galactic star counts.  The University is matching the award with               
              an equal amount of funds.
