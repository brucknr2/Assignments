Abstract    :
              Students are engaged in concept formulation, non-routine problem               
              solving, and applications in the Enhanced Calculus being offered as an         
              alternative to the standard calculus course.  This new approach to             
              calculus is made possible because of a classroom/  laboratory equipped         
              with Macintosh II computers running Mathematica.                               
                                                                                             
              The institution will contribute an amount equal to the award.
