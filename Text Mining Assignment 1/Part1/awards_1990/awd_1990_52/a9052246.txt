Abstract    :
              An immunology course is being developed to teach students modern               
              immunology  and some of its experimental approaches. In the                    
              laboratory, students learn state-of-the-art techniques that are used in        
              many different aspects of immunological research. They generate and            
              characterize novel monoclonal antibodies, learn tissue culture                 
              techniques and the theory and practise of immunoassays. The equipment          
              purchased for tissue culture includes laminar flow hoods, a CO2                
              incubator, a centrifuge, and inverted microscopes. For immunoassays,           
              the equipment includes a plate puch kit for immunodiffusion assays, a          
              plate reader for enzyme-linked immunoassays, and the apparatuses for           
              Western blot analysis. The college will contribute an amount equal to          
              the award.
