Abstract    :
              A three week laboratory course on gene manipulation for 16                     
              undergraduate faculty is being offered during the summer of 1991               
              and the summer of 1992.   The workshop is designed to impart up-               
              to-date techniques currently used by molecular biologists. The                 
              experiments involve the cloning of two bacterial genes in order to             
              show the mechanics of gene analysis, manipulation and sequencing.              
              The content is based on an advanced undergraduate laboratory course            
              that has been taught for nine years at the University of Minnesota.            
              Modifications are incorporated to provide instructors with the                 
              background to teach these techniques in their undergraduate                    
              laboratory classes at their home institutions. Major sites for                 
              recruitment of participants in this course are  colleges and                   
              universities where a majority of the student body consists of women            
              or members of racial and ethnic groups under-represented in                    
              science.  //
