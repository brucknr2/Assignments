Abstract    :
              The workshop familiarizes engineering undergraduate faculty with               
              recent developments in the design of new products for manufacture              
              (DFM).  Several tools and methods, including customer-driven                   
              engineering, product rating for assembly based on part geometry or             
              assembly motions, and the use of the manufacturing process                     
              capability for setting the tolerance limits for new parts are                  
              presented and discussed with classroom and laboratory exercises.
