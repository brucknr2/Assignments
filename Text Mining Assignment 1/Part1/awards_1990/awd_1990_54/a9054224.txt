Abstract    :
              The project is enabling introductory physics teachers to develop               
              the instructional, computing and laboratory interfacing skills they            
              need to help their students learn physics by using the computer in             
              the exploration of real world phenomena.  A two-week seminar is                
              being offered in the summer of 1991 for thirty college and                     
              university teachers and will be repeated in the summer of 1992 for             
              thirty more undergraduate teachers.  Participants will remain in               
              contact with one another and with the seminar instructors via a                
              BITNET teleconference during the academic year after each seminar              
              is conducted.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              Topics covered in the summer seminars include:  interactive                    
              instructional strategies based on outcomes of educational research;            
              computer interfacing; use of spreadsheets and graphing packages;               
              data and error analysis techniques; the application of laboratory              
              interfacing and real time data analysis to lecture demonstrations;             
              and numerical problem solving and modeling.
