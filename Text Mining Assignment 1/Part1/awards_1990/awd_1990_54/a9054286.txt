Abstract    :
              The Massachusetts Microelectronics Center will conduct a two week              
              (ten day) project-oriented workshop on the fundamentals of VLSI                
              design and CAD tool usage.  This workshop will be directed towards             
              EE faculty with little experience in VLSI design, EE faculty with              
              expertise in VLSI but little familiarity with the design tools                 
              available in an academic environment, and CS faculty with minimal              
              acquaintance with electronic engineering.  The goal of the course              
              is to equip the faculty with the resources necessary to conduct an             
              undergraduate course in VLSI design that would culminate in the                
              fabrication and subsequent test of student-designed chips.  Topics             
              will include an introduction to UNIX, device behavior, design                  
              methodology, design styles, and process fundamentals.  Lectures                
              will be supplemented by design and simulation laboratory exercises             
              on CAD workstations.  Emphasis will be on public-domain CAD tools              
              in a UNIX environment.  The course will culminate in the                       
              fabrication of individual projects.  Fabricated chips will be                  
              mailed to participants shortly after the end of the workshop.
