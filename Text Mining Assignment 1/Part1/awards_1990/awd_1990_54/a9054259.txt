Abstract    :
              A three week workshop is being conducted in the area of polymer                
              chemistry. The course is designed for faculty who will be teaching             
              undergraduate courses in this area.  The pedagogical approach aims             
              to overcome much of the reluctance to consider polymer chemistry               
              as an important aspect of undergraduate training in chemistry.  The            
              course is composed of lectures, lecture demonstrations, and                    
              laboratory experiments. Ramifications of the course beyond                     
              preparing faculty to comfortably and enthusiastically teach polymer            
              chemistry include activities to inspire faculty to consider                    
              supervising undergraduate research in polymer chemistry and more               
              frequent discussions of polymers in core courses such as organic               
              chemistry and physical chemistry.
