Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              PLANTS IN EVOLUTION:  The Fossil Record                                        
                                                                                             
              Plants in Evolution:  The Fossil Record involves the development of a          
              wall chart and ancillary materials which depicts plant development over        
              geological time.  This material fills a void in the available material         
              designed to tell the story of organic evolution.  Prior attention among        
              paleontologists has been largely devoted to the evolutionary development       
              of animals.  With the synthesis and use of the project materials, a more       
              complete view of the changing array of life will be available.                 
                                                                                             
              A teachers guide will be developed to aid secondary school teachers in         
              the proper use of the chart, provide background material, and coordinate       
              the chart content with textbooks which are usually available for high          
              school biology.
