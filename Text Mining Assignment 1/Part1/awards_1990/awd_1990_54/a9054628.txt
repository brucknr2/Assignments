Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              In every drop of water, down at the scale of atoms and molecules, there        
              is a world that can fascinate even young, non-verbal science students          
              and ardent science-phobes.  The objective will be to learn science             
              through guided discovery.  Students will study liquid water and                
              molecular networks using advanced technology to provide windows into           
              submicroscopic worlds, first of water and later of macromolecules such         
              as proteins and DNA.  The study of water is interdisciplinary, spanning        
              the disciplines of biology, chemistry, and physics.  Students will study       
              questions that cut across these disciplines as well as those internal to       
              each field.  A new generation of desktop computers now permits us to           
              leapfrog directly from the large-scale properties of water that we             
              experience every day to "real time" dynamic motions in the                     
              submicroscopic world.  This permits students to learn according to a new       
              paradigm:  doing science while exploring and manipulating structures           
              using student-controlled, animated graphic, simulations on the molecular       
              scale, rather than being told about science and given tests on                 
              structures.  The project will actively develop this new paradigm and           
              probe student understanding and seek to determine if students can apply        
              their insights and developed intuition to predict the properties               
              of a wealth of alternative materials easily and rapidly modeled by the         
              computer.
