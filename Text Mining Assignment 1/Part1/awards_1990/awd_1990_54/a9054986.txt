Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Herff College of Engineering at Memphis State University will              
              initiate a four-week, commuter Young Scholars project in Engineering,          
              Mathematics and Physics for 16 students entering grade 9.                      
                                                                                             
              A ten-week pre-summer session will introduce concepts in algebra,              
              geometry and trigonometry which will be reinforced with laboratory             
              exercises involving surveying methods, electrical circuits, and queuing        
              problems.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              During the four-week summer session students will examine simple               
              hydraulic and modelling problems and develop a scale model of a proposed       
              construction project.                                                          
                                                                                             
              During the nine-week post-summer session career opportunities will be          
              explored.
