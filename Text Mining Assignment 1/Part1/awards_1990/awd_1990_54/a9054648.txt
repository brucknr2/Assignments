Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Leading proponents of change to school mathematics, NCTM                  
              and MSEB among them, emphasize that data analysis can and must                 
              be a key component of a revitalized curriculum if mathematics                  
              is to relate to the practical world of the student and if it is                
              to provide the necessary skills for living in the information                  
              age.  In that spirit, this project addresses two complementary                 
              needs:  how to use data analysis to motive the essential topics                
              of a restructured mathematics curriculum and how to identify                   
              and teach those data analysis skills that are required for                     
              effective participation in society.  Following a detailed scope                
              and sequence for a data analysis strand, modules will be                       
              written that integrate data analysis into the teaching of many                 
              traditional topics in mathematics so that the topics will be                   
              motivated from real applications of interest to students and                   
              the statistical concepts will form a unified presentation of                   
              the subject.  Instructional practices suggested in the modules                 
              will emphasize problem solving, cooperative learning, student                  
              projects, uses of technology, oral and written communication of                
              mathematical ideas, and the interrelatedness of mathematical                   
              topics.
