Abstract    :
              The Ohio State University is offering a two-week intensive workshop            
              for undergraduate mathematics faculty, concentrating on the use of             
              new technology in mathematics instruction.  The workshop addresses             
              the use of graphing calculators and software in precalculus                    
              instruction, the use of symbolic computer algebra systems in                   
              calculus instruction, and the use of numerical linear algebra                  
              software in basic matrix theory courses.  The workshop introduces              
              the tools to participants, provides opportunities for extensive                
              hands-on experience in a laboratory setting, and encourages each               
              participant to develop an extensive project which blends                       
              technological tools with relevant mathematics and curriculum                   
              development issues.  The workshop is being offered twice during the            
              summer of 1991 and twice during the summer of 1992 to 25                       
              participants each session (50 each summer).  Follow-up meetings                
              will be held at the O.S.U. Technology Conferences scheduled for                
              November 1991 and November 1992, as well as brief weekend meetings             
              in spring 1991 and 1992.  An extensive effort is being made to                 
              recruit participants from underrepresented groups and participants             
              from colleges whose student population includes a large proportion             
              of members of underrepresented groups.//
