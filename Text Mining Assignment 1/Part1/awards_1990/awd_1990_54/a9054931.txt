Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Allegheny College will begin the creation of an exemplary Teacher              
              Education Program for the College that will be specifically for                
              the education of teachers of mathematics and science. Mathematics              
              and Science are areas of strength for Allegheny College.  The                  
              teacher preparation program will be a part of the responsibility               
              of all departments, not just the College of Education.  Science                
              and Mathematics Educators will hold appointments in the                        
              disciplinary departments so that the pedagogical preparation can               
              be integrated into the content education of the preservice                     
              teachers.  The project, also, will develop recruitment strategies              
              to attract excellent students into the program.
