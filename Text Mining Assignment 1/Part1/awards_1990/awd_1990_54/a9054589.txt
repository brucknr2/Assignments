Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Simmons College is being supported in a project to improve                     
              elementary school science education through the collaborative                  
              efforts of teachers, administrators and representatives from                   
              local industry.  In a series of summer residential workshops and               
              academic year follow-up activities, they propose to assist 120                 
              teachers, science coordinators, and principals to expand their                 
              own and their students' understanding and appreciation of                      
              science.  Among the activities planned are: (a) a series of one-               
              day, in-service workshops for science coordinators, participant                
              teachers, and participant principals, (b) 10-12 day in-residence               
              intensive seminars for science teachers which will include field               
              trips and tours of local industry, seminars, and work in the                   
              Simmons College computing and laboratory facilities, (c) brief                 
              preparatory and follow-up seminars with participants to assess                 
              the outcomes of the workshops, including the effectiveness of                  
              the instructional modules generated.
