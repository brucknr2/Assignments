Abstract    :
              A three-week workshop is being offered for individuals who  teach              
              introductory astronomy courses but whose professional training is              
              in another field.  The 20 participants are being exposed to (1)                
              observing with astronomical telescopes; (2) devices, including                 
              portable equipment, that can be used to stimulate student interest             
              in the cosmos; (3) a variety of additional activities that                     
              illustrate the methods of astronomy and that can be used to enhance            
              undergraduate teaching programs. Participants reside on Tufts'                 
              residential campus in Medford, Massachusetts, and have access to               
              the facilities of the Witin Observatory of Wellesley College, some             
              20 miles distant, for observing sessions.  A large portion of the              
              remainder of the time is being devoted to involving participants               
              in the types of "laboratory" exercises they might use with their               
              students.  Other activities will include a field trip to a nearby              
              radio observatory; discussion of classroom techniques; and                     
              discussions of current research in relevant fields.
