Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This SGER proposal will make it possible to sustain an effort by               
              precollege classroom teachers to investigate diagnosis of students'            
              knowledge and reasoning in physics and mathematics, especially as the          
              results of the diagnoses are used to guide subsequent instruction.             
              The project is an example of a practical interaction between research          
              on teaching and learning.  Development of instructional materials and          
              teacher development.  The investigators will revise and use an                 
              diagnostic teaching system (begun under an earlier private sector              
              grant) to build a knowledge base of student thinking from which                
              interrelationships between thinking in various topic areas within              
              physics and between thinking in  physics and in mathematics.  The              
              assessment of student thinking will guide revision of instructional            
              materials and activities to make them more relevant to students'               
              initial conceptions and reasoning.  Four teachers, including the two           
              PIs, will interact as peer mentors addressing questions relevant               
              instruction.  Expected products include a publication on diagnosis of          
              student thinking in physics and mathematics and a paper about                  
              collaboration among peer teachers as a framework for developing more           
              reflective practitioners, for developing the teacher as researcher.
