Abstract    :
              Economics faculty are participating in three day workshops  to                 
              learn instructional techniques that utilize laboratory experiments             
              by undergraduate students who are enrolled in principles of                    
              economics and intermediate theory classes.  These techniques                   
              demonstrate to students the basis and applicability of economic                
              theory and provide valuable feedback to instructors on student                 
              perceptions of theory.  Utilizing computer facilities at the                   
              Economic Science Laboratory at the University of Arizona, the                  
              faculty participate in established experiments and learn the                   
              techniques for designing experiments for undergraduate instruction.            
              The objective of the workshops is to add a new dimension to                    
              instruction and to improve the teaching and understanding of                   
              undergraduate economics.  The workshops are being conducted during             
              the Spring and Summer, 1991.//
