Abstract    :
              This two-week workshops is designed for engineering facultywishing             
              to update their mechanics programs and integrate computers into                
              them. Week One recognizes the centrality of mechanics to                       
              engineering by creating opportunities for participants to receive              
              lectures on pedagogy and new developments in engineering science               
              related to mechanics. It also provides attendees with up-to-date               
              instruction on computer programming and emphasizes the integration             
              of computing as a computational support tool to mechanics based                
              courses.  Lectures will be complemented with computer application              
              and problem-solving sessions. During Week Two, perspectives on                 
              graduate level mechanics are introduced along with reports on                  
              current research being conducted in mechanics-related areas.                   
              Contact will be maintained with participants for a period after the            
              workshops to distribute interesting mechanics and mechanics-                   
              related computer applications and problems.//
