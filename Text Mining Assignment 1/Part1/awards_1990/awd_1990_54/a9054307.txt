Abstract    :
              The objective of the two-day workshop, "Creative and Structured                
              Design Methods," is to present various design methodologies to                 
              engineering faculty, to give them the opportunity to share their               
              teaching experiences, and to apply interdisciplinary concepts to               
              discipline-based instruction in design.   The workshop is conducted            
              in conjunction with the 1991 National ASEE conference in New                   
              Orleans, similar to the very successful, NSF-funded workshop                   
              conducted in conjunction with the 1989 National ASEE Meeting in                
              Nebraska (USE-8950029).  In addition, a second workshop will be                
              held, which will complement the first by providing a follow-up                 
              experience for the faculty who attended the 1989 workshop as well              
              as  an alternative experience for those who are not able to attend             
              the two-day workshop.
