Abstract    :
              The  project is  providing fifteen undergraduate faculty in Life               
              Sciences with the biological background and logistical information             
              necessary to organize and offer field trip/courses in ecology,                 
              invertebrate zoology, marine biology, animal behavior or phycology.            
              Participants  are spending one week at a biological field station              
              on the northern Gulf of California in an intensive course in                   
              invertebrate zoology, phycology, ecology and ecological field                  
              techniques.  During their training, they are gaining new knowledge             
              about ecological interactions and developing and testing a set of              
              field ecology projects that they can have students do in the                   
              future.  Natural field study experiences are the most effective                
              way for students and teachers to gain an appreciation for the                  
              complexity and beauty of nature. After organizing and running a                
              field trip of their own, the participants evaluate the                         
              effectiveness and relevance of the training course as an aid to                
              their teaching methods.//
