Abstract    :
              This project is enabling the Departments of Geological Sciences                
              and Astronomy to develop a series of new freshmen/sophomore                    
              seminars for all liberal-arts undergraduates at the University                 
              of Michigan.  The goals of these seminars are to enhance the                   
              science instruction of potential science majors as well as non-                
              science majors.  These seminars are limited in enrollment to                   
              twenty students, are taught by senior faculty,  have teaching                  
              assistants to provide extensive outside-class help to students,                
              and require an oral presentation as well as a written paper on                 
              selected topics.  Seminars are in-depth treatments of                          
              scientific issues (in astronomy, geology, paleontology or                      
              oceanography) which are of importance to students' lives; the                  
              courses are not meant to he comprehensive introductory                         
              offerings.  Ample time for in-class question/answer periods and                
              discussions enhance student participation and critical                         
              thinking; at the same time, the classes with their small size                  
              provide better opportunity for student-faculty contact than our                
              present large lecture offerings.  Some of these seminars have                  
              hands-on laboratory or computing components, others are planned                
              with short field trips.  The teaching assistants associated                    
              with these seminars help lead discussions and give occasional                  
              lectures under close supervision of the faculty; this allows us                
              to train these TA's in classroom methods.  It is hoped that an                 
              increase in the numbers of undergraduate concentrators in                      
              science fields will be an eventual result of these seminars.
