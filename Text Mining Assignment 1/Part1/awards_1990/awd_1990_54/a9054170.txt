Abstract    :
              Thirty college mathematics faculty are exploring differential                  
              equations as they are applied to a variety of different topics,                
              with an emphasis on mathematical modeling in ecology. During the               
              three week workshop selected fundamental topics from differential              
              equations will be discussed and it will be shown how these topics              
              can be useful in contemporary mathematical modeling problems,                  
              particularly problems in population dynamics including those                   
              factors which lead to the extinction or survival of endangered                 
              species. The emphasis will be on basic new theoretical results                 
              and their uses as well as mathematical modeling techniques.                    
              Participants will submit reports indicating how these ideas were               
              incorporated into, or affected, their courses or their research                
              during the following year and reports will be distributed to all               
              participants.
