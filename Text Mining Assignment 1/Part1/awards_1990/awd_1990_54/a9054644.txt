Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Computer-based materials will be created to enable high school students        
              to develop specific concepts in advanced mathematics and trigonometry          
              through guided exploration of sound and hearing.  The novelty of this          
              approach lies in its integration of science and mathematics to promote         
              active, situated learning and in its use of computer-generated                 
              manipulatives to foster the development of physical intuition as a             
              precursor to mathematical abstraction.  Computer generated sound waves         
              are audible and displayed graphically and as an equation.  Changing the        
              either the sound or the graph or the equation will produce appropriate         
              changes in the other representations.  Operations are performed on the         
              waves in various "rooms", so that waves van be manipulated, added,             
              multiplied, etc.  Mathematics of trigonometry, vector addition,                
              logarithmic behavior and Fourier series can be studied.  The materials         
              will be field tested in area high schools and used in preservice and           
              inservice teacher education projects under a subcontract with UC Irvine.
