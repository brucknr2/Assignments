Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This two-year project will be conducted at the University of Puerto            
              Rico, Mayaguez, and will serve a cadre of twenty teachers of                   
              mathematics, fourteen at the secondary level and six at the middle             
              school level. All teachers will come from the Mayaguez area. The               
              project will provide two years of teacher education in the area of             
              statistics, which has recently been added to the secondary                     
              curriculum in Puerto Rico. During a six-week summer institute, the             
              teachers will learn statistical concepts and pedagogical strategies            
              through projects and activities. Current curriculum materials such             
              as the Quantitative Literacy Series will be introduced. Staff                  
              includes university statisticians and school personnel with                    
              expertise in pedagogy. During the academic year, staff will visit              
              the teachers' classrooms to provide support and assistance as the              
              teachers implement the statistics course. In addition, teacher                 
              participants will conduct dissemination workshops with their                   
              colleagues as needed and as appropriate. This project is                       
              significant in its likelihood of building a cadre of teachers with             
              strong statistics expertise in the Mayaguez area.                              
                                                                                             
              Cost sharing is provided by the University as 10% of the NSF                   
              request.
