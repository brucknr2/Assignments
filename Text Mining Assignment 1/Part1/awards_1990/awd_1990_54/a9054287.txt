Abstract    :
              The workshops are designed to introduce participants to the                    
              rapidly changing technologies in molecular biology.                            
              Teleconferencing and computer networking will be used to promote               
              integration of the workshops, as well as pre- and post-workshop                
              activities.  Strong lines of communication will be developed,                  
              between the participants and the instructors, to facilitate the                
              incorporation of the learned techniques and concepts into the                  
              education of undergraduates at the participants' home institutions.
