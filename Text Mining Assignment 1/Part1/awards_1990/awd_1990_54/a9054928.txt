Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This project intends to develop a complete curriculum for                 
              grades 5-8.  The materials to be produced are: instructional                   
              materials, staff development materials, and assessment                         
              materials.                                                                     
                                                                                             
                   The instructional materials will consist of 40 units each                 
              of about 3-4 weeks duration.  They will be developed in the                    
              spirit of the Standards grades 5-8.  There will be a "Teacher's                
              Guide" to provide information on activities, video clips, and                  
              technological tools related to each unit.  The staff                           
              development material will consist of two pieces: an inservice                  
              program and a teacher network model.  The latter component is                  
              to lend support to the teachers.  It will include such things                  
              as electronic bulletin boards and collaborative organizations.                 
              The third part of the project will be the assessment materials                 
              which will consist of instructional assessment materials and a                 
              "core" curriculum readiness examination to assess the students'                
              readiness for the "core" curriculum as described in the 9-12                   
              section of the Standards.
