Abstract    :
              The purpose of the workshops is to demonstrate the utility of                  
              computer algebra, to allow the participants hands-on experience                
              using computer algebra, and to provide a forum for the creation and            
              exchange of materials developed for various mathematics courses.               
              An additional purpose of the workshops is to disseminate the                   
              information and materials gained from two years of experience in               
              using the computer algebra laboratory which was partially funded               
              by the NSF ILI Program. The workshops are designed for instructors             
              of undergraduate mathematics.  Participants learn to use the                   
              computer algebra system, Maple, and have access to a computer at               
              all times during the workshop.  Participants are expected to                   
              produce curricular materials relating to their own areas of                    
              expertise and all material is shared during and at the end of the              
              workshops.  A network is being formed for the purpose of sharing               
              materials produced by the participants subsequent to the workshops,            
              and to ensure continued communication between participants. //
