Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Institute of Ecosystem Studies is requesting two year support to           
              enhance, test, produce and disseminate an ecology curriculum entitled          
              Eco-Inquiry.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              The foundation of this multi-dimensional, 8 to 15 week, 5th and 6th            
              grade curriculum has been built through four years of local development        
              and testing.  Eco-Inquiry has three distinctive features:  1) its              
              emphasis on the conceptual underpinnings of ecological literacy -              
              nutrient cycling and energy flow, 2) its commitment to demystifying the        
              practice of science and scientists, and 3) its approach to developing          
              students' inquiry skills and dispositions through modeling the                 
              scientific community in the classroom.  Eco-Inquiry uses a diversity of        
              teaching methods (e.g., collaborative learning, teaching for conceptual        
              change) to engage students in activities that are imaginative and highly       
              participatory.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              The Institute of Ecosystem Studies (IES) is a division of The New York         
              Botanical Garden, founded in 1983 to promote educational programs in           
              ecology.  IES field, laboratory and education facilities are at the Mary       
              Flagler Cary Arboretum in Millbrook, New York; additional field sites          
              are located throughout the northeastern United States and elsewhere.
