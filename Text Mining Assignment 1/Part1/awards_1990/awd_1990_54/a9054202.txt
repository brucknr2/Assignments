Abstract    :
              A Computer Algebra Workshop is being held to provide undergraduate             
              faculty (chemistry, mathematics, and physics) from the universities            
              in Puerto Rico, with a computational tool to enhance and stimulate             
              traditional teaching in natural sciences.  Fifteen participants are            
              receiving intensive "hands-on" training from experienced instructors           
              in the use of REDUCE, a computer algebra system.  Participants are             
              being encouraged to develop specific applications of computer algebra          
              in their respective fields.  As a follow-up, and also for motivation           
              and support, a user's group linked via a local network (UPRENET) is            
              being established.
