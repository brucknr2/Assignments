Abstract    :
              The constantly developing field of biotechnology is widely regarded            
              as one of the most vital scientific areas of potentially great                 
              importance.  It is essential that students at institutions of                  
              higher education, including community colleges, four-year colleges             
              and universities, be made aware of the principles and techniques               
              of this rapidly developing field. The workshop offers to                       
              participants direct exposure to a distinguished research faculty               
              in biotechnology and provides them with hands-on experiences in the            
              current techniques in both applied molecular biology and cell                  
              culture using state-of-the-art equipment in an effectively designed            
              teaching laboratory.  Participants  prepare reagents and                       
              demonstration materials that can readily be used at their home                 
              institutions and design exercises that will be feasible to perform             
              in laboratory courses at their home institutions. Following the                
              intensive summer program, participants are kept informed of the                
              newest developments in biotechnology through a specially designed              
              biotechnology seminar program held on the Rutgers-Newark campus                
              during the academic year. Invited speakers include prominent                   
              research scientists from academia, from research institutes and                
              from industry.
