Abstract    :
              Two workshops on Integrated Engineering Workstations for Science               
              and Engineering Faculty explore computer-controlled experiments in             
              undergraduate laboratories.  Participants develop experiment and               
              class material that emphasizes creative problem-solving ability                
              appropriate to projects at the home institution.  Workshop faculty             
              provide follow-up consultation through electronic mail.  //
