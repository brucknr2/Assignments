Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal seeks funding to support improvement of                          
              mathematics education in aviation technology programs.  AATC's                 
              partner is Northwest Airlines which has pledged $300,000 or more               
              of in-kind aviation equipment and training aids and $100,000 of                
              in-kind personnel costs.  There are three major goals: (1)                     
              strengthening the mathematics component of the two aviation                    
              technology programs offered by AATC by the design, development,                
              pilot-testing and revision of three new courses in collaboration               
              with avionics engineers; (2) exposing students in their aviation               
              technology programs to "the real-world workplace of a major                    
              employer of aviation technicians"; (3) increasing the                          
              opportunities for women and minorities in aviation technical                   
              education.  Each of these goals has two or more objectives.                    
              Federal support will assist the college in creating a new                      
              faculty position in mathematics to its staff as well as a new                  
              clerical position to manage the logistics of the partnership                   
              after the end of the NSF-sponsored project.
