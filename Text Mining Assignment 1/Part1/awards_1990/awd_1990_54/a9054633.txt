Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Recently we have been developing a new paradigm for learning concepts of       
              probability and fractals which focuses on a form of Guided Discovery in        
              which cues are placed in such a fashion that the student is able to            
              follow in the footsteps of a researcher.  In order to learn more about         
              this alternative route to learning science, we propose to hold a               
              workshop to bring together both phy7sical scientists and cognitive             
              scientists, as ell as high school teachers and students.  In the first         
              phase of the meeting, participants will work with the hands-on                 
              activities and the computer software and cecome familiar with their            
              content and format.  Next, specialists in cognitive science will propose       
              research methodologies that can be used to determine what students who         
              use these materials are learning, and how their learning process differs       
              from that in a more traditional science class.  Does the introduction of       
              multiple representations lead to the development of higher order               
              thinking skills?  Can a visual representation in a computer simulation         
              provide an alternative route to learning science for the student who           
              does not deeply understand mathematics?  What features of the                  
              educational setting can lead to a revolution in high school science            
              teaching?  How could answers to these questions affect the development         
              of further games, activities, and computer programs, both at Boston            
              University and elsewhere?  Finally, what resources must be assembled to        
              carry out this program of study and research?  The outcome of the              
              workshop will be an over-arching vision, a research strategy, and a set        
              of tactics.
