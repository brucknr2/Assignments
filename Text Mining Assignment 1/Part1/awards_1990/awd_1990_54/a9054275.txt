Abstract    :
              The State University of New York College at Brockport, in                      
              cooperation with the U.S. Geological Survey, proposes an                       
              Undergraduate Faculty Enhancement Workshop for Teachers of                     
              Introductory Courses with Hydrology and Water Resources Content.               
              The two-week workshop will be held July 22 - August 2, 1991, at the            
              National Training Center in Denver, Colorado, for 25 selected                  
              undergraduate college instructors of introductory course with                  
              hydrology and water resources content.  The major purposes of the              
              workshop are: (a) to bring participants up-to-date on the science              
              of hydrology and those technologies used to measure, analyze, and              
              calculate hydrologic flows, surface and groundwater resources, and             
              pollutant loadings and consequences, and (b) to equip and encourage            
              these teachers to use the latest in water resources information                
              and instructional materials in their classrooms.                               
                                                                                             
              Educational materials developed by Workshop participants will be               
              presented at the Twenty-Eighth Annual American Water Resources                 
              Association Conference in Fall 1992.
