Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a three year project to help teachers learn about                      
              contemporary applications of mathematics and of modern                         
              technology so that these can be used to engage high school                     
              students in problem solving.  It also hopes that such will                     
              increase the interest of female and minority students in science               
              and mathematics. Two mathematics teachers from each high school                
              will receive intensive training on both the "content" of the                   
              project as well as how to do peer coaching in its                              
              implementation. All high school mathematics teachers will                      
              receive training on the use of technology, mathematical                        
              connections, and problem solving applications.  The business                   
              sector will be involved directly in providing examples of each                 
              of these components through providing mentors for the teachers                 
              as well as summer internships for teachers from each high                      
              school.
