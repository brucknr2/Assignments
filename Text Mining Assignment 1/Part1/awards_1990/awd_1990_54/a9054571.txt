Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Huntsville Alliance for Science Project (HASP) will provide                
              two mobile laboratories, equipped and staffed by industry, to bring            
              laboratory experience to schools with no laboratories and to bring             
              about change in schools in which laboratories are underutilized.               
              One van will be equipped with kits of materials to support                     
              experiments in grades 3-6, and these teachers will be given in-                
              service training and support from industrial scientists.  The other            
              van will be a student laboratory for grades 6-8.
