Abstract    :
              A six-day residential workshop on the "Ecology of the Chesapeake               
              Bay" for 24 community college science faculty from the five-state              
              Chesapeake Bay watershed is being held in Summer 1991 at the                   
              University of Maryland's Chesapeake Biological Laboratory (CBL),               
              Solomons, Maryland.  The workshop includes two days of lecture, two            
              days of field activities on CBL's research vessels, and two days               
              of laboratory work at CBL.  The technical content is being provided            
              by CBL researchers and focuses on the topics "Plant Life"  and                 
              "Waterfowl and Vertebrate Fish".  These topics were selected by                
              community college science faculty in the 17 Maryland community                 
              colleges, in response to a survey administered in spring 1989.                 
              Field activities expose workshop participants to Chesapeake Bay                
              nutrient and toxic budgets and to hydroacoustics technologies.                 
                                                                                             
              A significant follow-up activity is a videoconference scheduled for            
              October 1991 for 400-500 additional persons, including educators               
              in the biological, physical and social sciences, interested                    
              teachers, government officials dealing with the environment, and               
              industrial representatives.  Partial support for this follow-up                
              videoconference is from the Chesapeake Bay Trust. //
