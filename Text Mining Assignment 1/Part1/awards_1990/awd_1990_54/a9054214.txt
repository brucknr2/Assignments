Abstract    :
              Southwestern area mathematics faculty are attending one of two                 
              workshops at the University of New Mexico in the summer of                     
              1991.  Thirty faculty members are participating in each one-week               
              workshop.  The participants are being provided with a TI-81                    
              graphing calculator and a HP-28S symbolic graphing calculator and              
              are given "hands-on" instruction in their use.  The emphasis is on             
              the use of these machines as laboratory instruments to gather data             
              and generate hypotheses.  Discovery via visualization is the                   
              central theme. A newsletter including descriptions of post-                    
              workshop experiences of participants will be distributed two times             
              in the year following the workshops and presentations will be made             
              at regional professional meetings.
