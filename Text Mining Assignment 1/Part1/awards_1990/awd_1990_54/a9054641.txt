Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project matches the "at risk" population of Head Start and its            
              staff with the expertise of the Hands On Science Outreach (HOSO) program       
              in producing playful units of lesson guides, manipulative kits and             
              teacher training.  Working with mathematics consultants, three units           
              (fall, winter and spring) have been designated around NUMERATION, CHANCE       
              AND GEOMETRY.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              The activities in the program will be multi-cultural, multi-sensory and        
              will focus around toys and games which the children will be able to take       
              home and own.  They will take into consideration the development of both       
              large and small motor skills.  There will be clear indications for             
              interdisciplinary classroom use.  Parent information will be available         
              in English, Spanish, and Vietnamese, with a visual videotape component         
              and meetings planned into the project.  These should help apply home           
              continuity for the relevancy of mathematics concepts to everyday               
              activities.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              The MATHSTART units will be piloted, evaluated and refined in five             
              demographically different Head Start programs in Maryland.  After              
              refinement, further dissemination will occur through both the Head Start       
              and HOSO networks.
