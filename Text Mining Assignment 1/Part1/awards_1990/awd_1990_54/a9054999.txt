Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Western Illinois University will initiate a three-week, residential            
              Young Scholars project in multidisciplinary Science/Mathematics for 30         
              students entering grade 8.                                                     
                                                                                             
              The project consists of instructional and experiential activities on           
              campus during the summer, one week of internship with practitioners in         
              the field, a one-day fall colloquium, and once-a-month interactive             
              satellite television (noncommercial) program sessions throughout the           
              academic year.  Instructional components include hands-on laboratory           
              work related to research areas in each discipline as well as ethical           
              questions relevant to career opportunities in science, technology and          
              mathematics.  Project staff includes University faculty with aid from          
              junior high science teachers and business/industry representatives.
