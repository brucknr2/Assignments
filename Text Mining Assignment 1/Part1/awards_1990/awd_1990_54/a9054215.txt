Abstract    :
              The workshop reviews the aircraft design decision making process,              
              including technological, economic, market and manufacturing                    
              considerations, and provides participants with the opportunity to              
              work on a design project of their own.  The workshop will also                 
              include discussion on how to incorporate the design process into               
              the undergraduate aeronautical engineering curriculum, hence                   
              improving the design and the design-teaching skills of engineering             
              faculty.
