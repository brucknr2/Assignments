Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Education Development Center, Inc. (EDC), in collaboration with                
              seven school districts, two subcontractors (EdCo and Inverness                 
              Research Associates), a publisher (Sunburst Communications), and               
              a large group of consultants and advisors, proposes to develop a               
              new mathematics curriculum that will address the unique needs of               
              middle school students.  This curriculum will build upon the                   
              central theme of mathematics in the human experience and will                  
              focus upon students' learning to see and think mathematically.                 
              It will reflect a view of learning as a process of constructing                
              one's own knowledge, and it will emphasize the importance of                   
              the social context of learning for middle school students.  It                 
              will integrate the use of computer simulations, exploratory                    
              environments, and tools.                                                       
                                                                                             
              This project will bring a new vision of mathematics, new types of              
              learning experiences, and a new structure to the middle school                 
              curriculum.  It will also address the critical issues that can                 
              determine whether a new curriculum is widely accepted and used                 
              well, including teacher suport, student assessment, classroom                  
              implementation, curriculum evaluation, and parent involvement.
