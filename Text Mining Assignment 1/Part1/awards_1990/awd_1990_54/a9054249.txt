Abstract    :
              In this project, undergraduate computer science faculty interact               
              with senior industrial software project managers and other                     
              industrial software practitioners.  Activities include discussion              
              of current literature and construction of solution approaches to               
              proposed software development and project management scenarios.                
              Participants observe current software engineering practices and                
              tools in action at industrial sites and discuss with industry                  
              practitioners the standards and procedures used.                               
              The first phase of the project is a six day session during which               
              participants will interact with the individuals from industry.                 
              Then the participants will develop an academic project to                      
              incorporate material into their classroom.  Following this                     
              development there will be a two day session to share the results               
              of this development. Finally the ideas will be actually be used                
              in the classroom.//
