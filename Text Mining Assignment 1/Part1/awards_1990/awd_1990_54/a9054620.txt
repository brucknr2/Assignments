Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The University of Chicago will sponsor a planning conference                   
              to focus on the mathematics preparation for teaching                           
              elementary school.  The conference is being guided by an                       
              organizing committee which includes members from four other                    
              teacher education institutions within Illinois.  The                           
              conference participants will meet twice, once in January and                   
              again in May 1991.  In between the two sessions, the                           
              participants will work on positions and plans coming out of                    
              the conference.  The conference participants will include                      
              mathematicians, mathematics educators, teachers, scientist,                    
              and others from research institutions as well as traditional                   
              teacher education institutions with large teacher education                    
              enrollments.  The conference proceedings will be widely                        
              disseminated through additional funding from the EXXON                         
              Foundation.  The proceedings will consist of carefully                         
              delineated issues and possible approaches to address those                     
              issues.  The intent is to generate a set of possible                           
              alternative responses, supported by sound rational, and to                     
              stimulate the field to work seriously and collectively to                      
              improve the preparation of teachers in mathematics.                            
                                                                                             
              The cost sharing is over 50% of the NSF funding.
