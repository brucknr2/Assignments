Abstract    :
              The proposal received five panel ratings, all Excellent.  We concur            
              this is a highly meritorious proposal that will serve Hispanic                 
              students.  This project will provide accelearted mathematics                   
              instruction to approximately 35 Hispanic students per year through             
              an instructional/counseling/mentoring model.  The program's goal               
              is to select Hispanic students who show promise and strong interest            
              in mathematics, but lack prerequisite skills in mathematics and                
              prepare them for calculus and courses in the physical and                      
              engineering sciences.  Students will also be assigned to a Hispanic            
              mentor who is a professional engineer scientist or mathematician,              
              and whose professional area is related to the career interests of              
              the student.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              There are some minor concerns that should be addressed, e.g. Who               
              will be the consultants?  What will be the rate of compensation for            
              the tutors?  What are the plans for follow up, i.e. post award?
