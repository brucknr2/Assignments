Abstract    :
              This project deals with modern methods of recombinant DNA and                  
              protein analysis, procedures that underlie much of current research            
              and development in biotechnology.  This field has evolved rapidly              
              over the past dozen years, a situation that has left many                      
              bioscience teachers, trained in an earlier period, with little or              
              no immediate relevant experience.  The  project addresses this gulf            
              by providing college faculty with the expertise necessary to                   
              introduce these elements into their undergraduate programs.  An                
              intense six-week practicum is at the core of the project, in which             
              each of the 20 participants masters the fundamental techniques.                
              To provide the teachers with an authoritative base of experience               
              the work is conducted using equipment and procedures consistent                
              with research standards.  Recognizing that college faculty must                
              operate within financial and time constraints in presenting                    
              undergraduate courses, the workshop also investigates low-cost and             
              time-efficient experimental modes that are appropriate to the                  
              teaching setting.  In addition to developing technical skills, the             
              work focuses on principles underlying the methods and their                    
              extension to problems at the forefront of research through group               
              discussions held daily.  To make the connection with current                   
              research in the field more tangible, one day per week will be set              
              aside for seminars and laboratory visits conducted by faculty                  
              associates, who will discuss the research work as it illustrates               
              applications in biotechnology.
