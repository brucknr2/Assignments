Abstract    :
              This workshop is considering methods, problems, and curricula                  
              changes necessary to use and teach the General Purpose                         
              Instrumentation Bus (GPIB) laboratory in the undergraduate EE                  
              curriculum.  The workshop stresses the smoothe integration of GPIB             
              equipment and computer simulation into sophomore and junior                    
              courses.  During the workshop, each participant is developing an               
              experiment of his/her own design;  during the subsequent academic              
              year, each participant writes a report on the GPIB activities at               
              their institution.//
