Abstract    :
              Object-oriented software development has emerged from research labs            
              to have signficant effect on computer science.  Undergraduate                  
              students exposed to object-oriented concepts have a richer set of              
              design models to use than do those acquainted only with functional             
              decomposition techniques.  The program is teaching these concepts              
              to select undergraduate faculty, thus increasing the number of                 
              students who benefit from exposure to object-oriented principles.              
                                                                                             
              The primary teaching method is hands-on experimentation with                   
              Smalltalk/V, an excellent vehicle for exploratory programming.                 
              Projects are being supplemented with discussions on wider issues,              
              such as object-oriented analysis and design, other object-oriented             
              languages, and issues in teaching these concepts to undergraduates.            
                                                                                             
              Participants take Smalltalk/V back to their home institutions both             
              for use in a larger project, and as an aid to spreading knowledge              
              about object-oriented techniques to their colleagues.  A spring                
              follow-up session provides an opportunity for the group to discuss             
              their projects, as well as their experiences with using this                   
              material in their classes.
