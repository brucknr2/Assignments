Abstract    :
              This workshop is focusing on the installation and implementation               
              of PC-based data acquisition systems in science and technology                 
              laboratories and is geared towared science or engineering                      
              technology faculty teaching in associate degree programs in the New            
              York City/New Jersey metropolitan area.  The workshop  includes                
              instruction in transducers, signal conditioning, analog to digital             
              and digital to analog converters and conversions,  programming, and            
              data acquisition systems, as well as intensive hands-on experience             
              with systems and components, installation, and debugging.                      
              Participants plan a project to install a computer-based data                   
              acquisition system in one of their own laboratories.//
