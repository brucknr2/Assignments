Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Western Kentucky University will initiate a 5-week, residential Young          
              Scholars project in Molecular Biology for 20 students entering grades          
              11,12.                                                                         
                                                                                             
              Each of the participants will undertake a research project with one of         
              four research faculty.  Research activities in DNA cloning and                 
              sequencing, enzyme analysis, and gene expression will continue through         
              the year at high schools in a follow-up program involving the research         
              staff and high school teachers.
