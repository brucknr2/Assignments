Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The project "Math, Science and Technology Education for Riverbend              
              in the 90's" aims to enhance math and science education for                    
              non-baccalaureate bound students in community college preparatory              
              programs and career programs in grades 6-12.  The project will                 
              involve directly 35 teachers and 740 students.  It will help to                
              prepare students for technological careers.  Current applications              
              of science and mathematics will be integrated into the curricula.              
              Underrepresented populations will be served.                                   
                                                                                             
              Independent mail reviews of the proposal were followed by a panel              
              discussion.  Each reviewer then provided detailed written                      
              comments identifying the strengths and weaknesses of the proposal              
              and giving his or her individual rating.                                       
                                                                                             
              The panelists viewed this as a comprehensive program with several              
              strengths.  There is a clear need for programs that will educate               
              the non-baccalaureate and that will reach underrepresented                     
              populations.  The project is well planned and well thought out.                
              It is cost effective.                                                          
                                                                                             
              The panel worried that 25% involvement of the project director                 
              may be too low.  elementary teachers should be involved.  The                  
              expectations of computer literacy may be too high.  The hourly                 
              rate of $415 needs clarification.                                              
                                                                                             
              Two of the panelists rated the proposal excellent and four rated               
              it very good.  I concur with this meritorious assessment.  If                  
              negotiations can remove the weaknesses, I recommend funding.
