Abstract    :
              This workshop is addressed to undergraduate college faculty who                
              teach courses in  historical geology, paleontology, petrology, or              
              related fields, and who have had little or no experience in modern             
              carbonates.  The purpose of the workshop is to expand the                      
              participant's understanding of modern carbonate sediments,                     
              precursors of ancient carbonates, and post depositional changes                
              that affect them.  Specific topics to be examined include                      
              carbonate-secreting organisms, sediments, environments of                      
              deposition, carbonate diagenesis, soil formation and interpretation            
              of Pleistocene analogues.  This workshop will also provide the                 
              participant with an opportunity to acquire photographs of specific             
              carbonate environments and to collect samples which may be used to             
              enhance instruction at his/her home institution.  A guidebook,                 
              approximately 100 pages in length, will be prepared and provided               
              for each participant.  Sets of slides of features requiring special            
              equipment will be provided to each participant including such                  
              material as underwater photographs and photomicrographs.  The                  
              program involves daily field work, labs and lectures and will be               
              held at the Bahamian Field Station, San Salvador, Bahamas.  As much            
              of the field work will involve snorkeling, participants must be                
              able to swim.//
