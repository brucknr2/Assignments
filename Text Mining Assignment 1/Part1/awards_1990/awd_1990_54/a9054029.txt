Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              The ability of individuals to successfully undertake curricula in              
              science and technology is acutely impacted by the availability of              
              appropriate assistive technology.  In many cases, neither the                  
              individual, his/her therapist, or the college counselor is aware               
              of all the available technology or the sources of funding for that             
              technology.  This project is designing, developing, and testing a              
              prototype expert system-based tool for accurately matching                     
              assistive technology and funding sources with individuals .  The               
              prototype is based on a unique concept of multidimensional                     
              taxonomies for disability causes and conditions, life purpose and              
              needs, and available products.  The prototype system is being                  
              evaluated in three institutional environments and the results                  
              assessed.  Based on the results of this study, the prototype system            
              may be converted to a fully functional product by Meeting the                  
              Challenge, Inc. and made available to institutions across the                  
              country thus providing a coherent mechanism for enhancing the                  
              success potential of many students with disabilities.
