Abstract    :
              Two workshops for groups of 18 faculty are being conducted in the              
              area of Fourier analysis and its applications. Participants are                
              being drawn from several disciplines: mathematics, physics,                    
              chemistry, electrical engineering; each of the disciplines included            
              makes extensive use of Fourier analysis and an interdisciplinary               
              seminar held as part of each workshop will focus on various modern             
              applications of Fourier analysis that can be understood by                     
              undergraduates. The lecture notes and exercise sets developed by               
              the participants will help the participants introduce corresponding            
              courses in their home institutions or to enrich and modernize                  
              sections of existing courses already in place within the                       
              curriculum.
