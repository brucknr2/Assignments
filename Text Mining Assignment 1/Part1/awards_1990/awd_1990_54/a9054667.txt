Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A standard notational system for scientific and mathematical symbols           
              will be developed to be used in computerized versions of science and           
              mathematics textbooks.  Software will be written to strip publishers'          
              typesetting tapes for science and mathematics textbooks of compositing         
              symbols. The resulting ASCII format can be used to drive refreshable           
              computer braille, large print display or speech output devices.  The           
              print disabled student can then study the texts using a personnel              
              computer with a user-friendly word processor.  This technique                  
              complements services of readers and recordings.
