Abstract    :
              This program is providing professional inservice enrichment to                 
              outstanding two-year college physics faculty members from the State            
              of Texas.  The program focuses on recent developments in physics               
              research, innovative physics teaching methods, and successful                  
              techniques for recruiting local minority students into two-year                
              college science and engineering programs.  The heart of the program            
              is an annual May Institute at Texas A&M University, complemented               
              by biannual academic-year follow-up workshops and university staff             
              visits to participants' campuses.//
