Abstract    :
                   This Research Opportunity Award funds a project "Design for               
              Assembly: A Conceptual Design Phase Approach" at Tennessee State               
              University in support of the University of Southern California's               
              Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Manufacturing              
              and Automation.  This two-year project is reporting to the Center's            
              Industry Advisory Board.                                                       
                   The research is studying the development of a design for                  
              assembly advisor, which is a rule-based expert advisory system that            
              identifies product design improvements and redesign tactics for                
              assembly to product designers.                                                 
                   A minority undergraduate student is also assisting these two-             
               year studies.                                                                 
                   The Program Manager recommends Tennessee State University be              
              awarded $100,000 for two (2) years.  An additional $10,000 is                  
              recommended from the supplemental program on Women, Minorities and             
              Disabled Engineering Research Assistants.
