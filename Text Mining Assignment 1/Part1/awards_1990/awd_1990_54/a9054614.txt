Abstract    :
              This project focusses on the significant role of the liberal arts              
              colleges in maintaining America's scientific and technological                 
              productivity.  Called Project Kaleidoscope (PKAL), the goal is to              
              deduce from the best in undergraduate science and mathematics                  
              education evidence for the most effective models for teaching and              
              learning in science and mathematics.                                           
              The project is led by a 9-person executive committee, and                      
              assisted by a 20-person advisory committee of prominent                        
              scientists and scientific administrators from a variety of kinds               
              of liberal arts institutions.  Project activities consist of                   
              leadership planning meetings, research into the state of and                   
              opportunities for undergraduate science and mathematics                        
              education, identification of exemplary programs, a national                    
              colloquium for discussion of the issues the planning meetings                  
              raise, and the production and wide dissemination of a report for               
              action.
