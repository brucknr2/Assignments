Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The University of Iowa will initiate two identical, three-week,                
              institutes as part of a residential Young Scholars project in                  
              Engineering for 60 students entering grades 11,12.                             
                                                                                             
              These engineering institutes, offered successively during the                  
              summer of 1991, will include a directed creative engineering                   
              design experience involving all the students as a team to find a               
              solution to a real-world, social-technical problem for an                      
              identifiable client.                                                           
                                                                                             
              The project also will include a follow-up program which involves               
              a mentor at each participant's high school and a number of                     
              activities to be completed during the 1991-92 academic year.                   
              This project is based on a pilot program held during the summer                
              of 1990.
