Abstract    :
              A two-week workshop (August 11-23, 1991) in laser/electro-optic                
              technology is being offered for four-year college teachers located             
              primarily in the Appalachian Region.  Participants receive                     
              instruction and training in the theory and principles of lasers,               
              laser safety, electro-optics, and the design and construction of               
              lasers.  Special attention is given to the use of lasers in                    
              advanced undergraduate laboratory experiments.  Applications in                
              basic science, analytical chemistry, medicine, communications, and             
              manufacturing will be illustrated in field trips to the Oak Ridge              
              National Laboratory, the Oak Ridge Methodist Medical Center, the               
              University of Tennessee, the Thompson Cancer Survival Center, the              
              Atom Sciences corporation, and in a local manufacturing plant and              
              local fiber optic communications company.                                      
                                                                                             
              Material for this proposed workshop has originated from a course               
              in laser/electro-optic technology developed by the Project                     
              Directory and taught at Pellissippi State Technical Community                  
              College.  Additional relevant material has arisen from innovative              
              laboratory experiments developed at West Virginia Wesleyan College.            
              Motivation for offering this workshop comes from a survey conducted            
              by the Laser Technology Center which showed that a need exists for             
              training and educating persons in laser/electro-optic technology.//
