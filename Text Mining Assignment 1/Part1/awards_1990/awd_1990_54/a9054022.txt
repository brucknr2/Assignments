Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              The purpose of this project is to study the issues involved in                 
              underrepresentation of undergraduate students with disabilities in             
              science and technology from the perspective of senior high school              
              and college undergraduate students with disabilities, parents of               
              students with disabilities, college science and engineering program            
              administrators and faculty, secondary special education program                
              administrators and teachers, disabled student service program                  
              directors, scientists and engineers with disabilities, and                     
              representatives of business/industry.  The study is identifying                
              barriers to career access opportunities and developing strategies              
              to remove or overcome them.  The project, involving four national              
              organizations, will conduct three regional workshops for                       
              approximately 300 invited participants using the nominal group                 
              technique process to generate, clarify, and prioritize the barriers            
              and strategies information.  The project will prepare and                      
              disseminate conference proceedings and a workshop (3,500 copies)               
              to facilitate replication of the workshop model in all areas of the            
              country.  The project's strengths include its potential impact on              
              on the target population, use of inter-organizational networks,                
              support and involvement of business and industry, and potential for            
              replication and sustained activities.
