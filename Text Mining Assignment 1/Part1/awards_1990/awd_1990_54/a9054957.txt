Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              This exploratory study is designed to determine attributes of                  
              large urban school districts which would maximize the                          
              probability of success for implementing and sustaining major                   
              educational reforms.  The study will include personal                          
              interviews with key change agents in a number of such school                   
              districts where changes have been attempted and will identify                  
              attributes which lead to failure as well as those which lead                   
              to success.  The project will culminate with a draft document                  
              of an "Urban School District Systemic Reform Initiative in                     
              Science and Mathematics" which incorporates findings, in NSF
