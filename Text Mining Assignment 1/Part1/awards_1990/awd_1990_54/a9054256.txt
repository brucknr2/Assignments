Abstract    :
              The one-week workshop introduces participants to the basic                     
              theoretical concepts of solid modeling and finite element analysis             
              and gives them hands-on experience with state-of-the-art modeling              
              systems.  Emphasis is placed on the integration of these concepts              
              into undergraduate design courses in the areas of mechanical,                  
              manufacturing, aerospace, agricultural and industrial engineering.             
              The workshop staff serves as a resource group during the                       
              implementation of workshop concepts at the home institution. //
