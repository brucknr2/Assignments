Abstract    :
              Three different one-week workshops on nuclear magnetic resonance               
              (NMR) spectroscopy will be offered for chemistry faculty from                  
              undergraduate institutions. The first week will cover introductory             
              material intended to help those who attended college and graduate              
              school before NMR spectrometers were commonplace.  The second will             
              emphasize the features of pulsed and multinuclear NMR, and the                 
              third will deal with sophisticated pulse sequences and two-                    
              dimensional techniques.  The workshops will combine lecture,                   
              computer simulation, hands-on instrumentation, and spectral                    
              analysis.
