Abstract    :
              This project will permit the established of a center designed to               
              assist minorities to have successful science and technology                    
              careers.  It will have four major components:  (a) specific science            
              and technology programs that facilitate the transitions of                     
              minorities from high school to college; (b) specific programs that             
              provide science and technology role models for minorities; (c)                 
              programs that improve science, math and pre-engineering courses in             
              elementary and secondary schools; and (d) develop a student                    
              information and tracking system.//
