Abstract    :
              The third conference on Computational Physics in the Undergraduate             
              Curriculum is being held October 2-5, 1991.  Targeting                         
              undergraduate physics faculty, the conference provides an                      
              opportunity for faculty to explore two of the most promising                   
              developments in computational physics: (1) symbolic computational              
              packages, such as Mathematica, and (2) pre-compiled packages, such             
              as MUPPET (Maryland University Project in Physics and Technology).             
                                                                                             
              In order to increase the impact of this conference on the physics              
              community, the project is being advertised nationally and utilizes             
              speakers of proven ability and national recognition in the field               
              of software development.  The project includes post-conference                 
              workshops on the most promising software development tools suitable            
              for distribution to physics faculty and students.  Development                 
              tools, software, and conference proceedings are being distributed              
              to all conference participants.
