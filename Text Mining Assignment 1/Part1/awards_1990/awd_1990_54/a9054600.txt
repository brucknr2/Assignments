Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Denver Earth Science Project, conducted by the Colorado                    
              School of Mines, will develop and implement earth science                      
              curriculum programs for kindergarten through secondary school.                 
              "Critical Issue" modules will be written in partnership with                   
              business, government, and education participants.  Each module                 
              will stress a critical issue related to the earth.  The modules                
              will integrate science, math, geography, and technology.  The                  
              program will strive to increase the interest of students in the                
              earth sciences.
