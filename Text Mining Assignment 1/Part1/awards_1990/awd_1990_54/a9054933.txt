Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This three year project sponsored by Arizona State                             
              University will offer a five week workshop to 32 "master"                      
              teachers in microchemistry techniques and in the learning                      
              cycle method of instruction.  The learning cycle is an                         
              effective inquiry-oriented method which helps students                         
              acquire key scientific concepts and improve their general                      
              thinking skills.  In each of the first two years 16 learning                   
              cycle modules will be prepared and microscale laboratory                       
              techniques will be included in these modules if appropriate.                   
              After each summer the master teachers will conduct an                          
              inservice program of eight 15 hour workshops for peer                          
              teachers in their districts or from nearby schools.  In the                    
              third year these 32 learning cycle modules for chemistry                       
              will be revised and a teachers guide for the use of these                      
              modules will be prepared.  The Master teachers in the                          
              project will become student teacher supervisors, assuring                      
              that the techniques of the program  will continue to be                        
              implemented in the schools.                                                    
                                                                                             
              The matching funds from the University and the school                          
              districts constitute 27% of the NSF grant.
