Abstract    :
              An intensive two-week laboratory workshop that allows 20 university            
              faculty to learn the basic principles, techniques and applications             
              of modern molecular biology is being offered during three summers.             
              The goal of the program is to provide participants with the                    
              experience and materials to implement an effective undergraduate               
              molecular biology laboratory program.  Because of rapid advances,              
              few educational institutions have been able to incorporate modern              
              molecular biology in their laboratory curricula.  This workshop                
              will provide an important contribution to undergraduate education              
              by offering undergraduate teaching faculty hands on experience with            
              these techniques.  The course consists of laboratory exercises in              
              DNA purifications and separations, gene cloning, Southern blotting             
              and hybridization, DNA amplification and sequencing, and DNA                   
              sequence analysis.  Laboratories are be supplemented with lectures             
              on the principles of the methods used, and by seminars on the                  
              applications of molecular biology, presented by recognized experts.            
              Laboratory and lecture emphasis is on applications that are                    
              applicable to undergraduate teaching laboratories, and participants            
              receive the necessary experience and manuals to implement the                  
              exercises.  Sustained interactions among participants and with the             
              staff is encouraged during the workshop by frequent discussion                 
              sessions, and following the course by holding a follow-up session              
              11 months later.  Here participants will their experiences in                  
              developing and implementing exercises into new and existing                    
              curricula.
