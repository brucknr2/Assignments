Abstract    :
              The notion that computer science courses at all levels should have             
              structured laboratory components is rapidly gaining national                   
              impetus. Faculty at Lawrence University are completing a three-                
              year project which has incorporated an algorithm visualization                 
              laboratory into courses spanning the entire computer science                   
              curriculum.  During this project they have developed software to               
              graphically animate algorithms and accompanying laboratory                     
              exercises which employ that software.  They now will offer a pair              
              of intensive, week-long workshops that will help thirty                        
              undergraduate faculty author their own visualization-based                     
              laboratory exercises using software which is available on                      
              VAXStations, Macintoshes, or IBM PC-compatibles.  After the week               
              of the workshop, participants will be able to continue preparing               
              such exercises at their home institutions.  This post-workshop work            
              will be distributed via electronic mail or other magnetic media.               
              The combination of workshop and post-workshop activities will thus             
              result in a nation-wide core group of computer science educators               
              actively developing intriguing laboratory exercises and facilities.
