Abstract    :
                   The survey of mathematics and science opportunity (SMSO) is               
              to:  1) develop a better methodology for measuring science and                 
              mathematics opportunity to learn in elementary and secondary                   
              schools; 2) develop a prototypical curriculum framework for the                
              analysis of mathematics and science materials; 3) develop a measure            
              of teacher knowledge; and 4) conduct an exploratory study of ways              
              to measure instructional practices.  The work will be done in three            
              phases:                                                                        
                   The first phase is the development of a mathematics and                   
              science content framework.  This work will lead to the development             
              of prototyical framework that will be used in the curriculum                   
              analysis for TIMSS.                                                            
                   A second phase is the development of coding manuals which                 
              describe the methodological procedures of how the framework would              
              be applied to the curricular materials.                                        
                   The third phase is to conduct research and development that               
              would produce survey instruments for TIMSS focusing on opportunity             
              to learn (OTL), teacher knowledge, and other schooling variables,              
              especially classroom processes (instructional practices).//
