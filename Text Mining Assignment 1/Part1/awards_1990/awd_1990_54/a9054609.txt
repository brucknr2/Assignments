              conducting a four-year project for Biotechnician Training.                     
              This project will develop a two-year curriculum leading to                     
              an A.A.S. degree in biotechnology, it will prepare students                    
              for employment as biotechnicians, it will increase the                         
              representation of minority and disadvantaged populations in
