Abstract    :
              The workshop will expose participants to state-of-the-art                      
              developments in computer networks, with emphasis on local area                 
              networks. It is designed for faculty at small colleges and                     
              universities and preference will be given to faculty at                        
              historically black colleges and universities and institutions with             
              large Hispanic or other minority enrollments. In addition faculty              
              from other small institutions are encouraged to apply. During a                
              typical day, time is evenly divided between network concepts and               
              theory and laboratory assignments on protocol design and                       
              implementation.//
