Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This model project proposes to increase participation and                      
              retention of women in computer science at Columbia Union                       
              College by two kinds of intervention:  participation and                       
              retention.  Participation intervention involves two workshops,                 
              one for colleges' female students who have not chosen a major                  
              and one for non-enrolled high school graduates.  The workshop                  
              will present career opportunities available in computer science                
              and discussion of career opportunities available in computer                   
              science and discussion of barriers encountered by women and                    
              ways to overcome them.  Retention intervention will involve the                
              use of health promotion activities and stress reduction                        
              techniques to alleviate computer anxiety.  Pre-tests and                       
              post-tests will be used to assess the effectiveness of the                     
              intervention strategies.//
