Abstract    :
              Workshops on microfabrication are being provided for 150                       
              undergraduate faculty over a two year period.  These workshops                 
              teach the technology used for the manufacture of integrated                    
              circuits, disk read-write heads, sensors, and other miniature                  
              devices.  Hands-on laboratory experience, under the direction of               
              experts in the field, are emphasized.  The subject matter is highly            
              interdisciplinary, appropriate for faculty from most science and               
              engineering departments.  The workshops are particularly                       
              appropriate for teachers of introductory courses in materials                  
              science and engineering, electrical engineering, chemistry and                 
              chemical engineering, and physics.  Teachers of general science                
              courses for non-science majors are encouraged to attend. The focus             
              is on experienced teachers without significant prior                           
              microfabrication skills.                                                       
                                                                                             
              Participants leave the workshops with the skills required to                   
              provide microfabrication demonstrations and experiments to their               
              own students. Participants are encouraged to join in the                       
              development of a laboratory manual and  are invited to follow-up               
              workshops for improvement of experiments.
