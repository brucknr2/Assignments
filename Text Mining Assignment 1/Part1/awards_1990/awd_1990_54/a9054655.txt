Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The purpose of this proposal is to develop video materials to                  
              enhance student interest in mathematics.  The means of                         
              accomplishing this purpose is to show the students a world of                  
              opporltunity open to those with good mathematical skills.  In                  
              particular the videos will involve women and minorities, and                   
              thus provide role models for women and minority students.                      
                                                                                             
              Each video will involve Jaime Escalante and people who have                    
              successfully applied mathematical skills in their chosen                       
              profession or job.                                                             
                                                                                             
              The materials produced will include: twelve videos and teacher                 
              material for each video.  This material is to give                             
              supplementary information for the teacher to use in leading a                  
              discussion of some of the mathematics involved.
