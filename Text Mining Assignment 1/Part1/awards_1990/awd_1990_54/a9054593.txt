Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Eagle-UnionCommunity School Corporation proposal seeks                     
              support to build upon and extend the work initiated with NSF                   
              support (                                                                      
              working partnership of many parts which is focusing on the use                 
              of modern technology for teaching science and mathematics.                     
              There are two major objectives of the project. E  Objective I:                 
              Teachers in grades four through ten will integrate essential                   
              problem solving, critical thinking, and communications skills                  
              into the science curriculum using information technologies                     
              (electronic mail, online database searching, and CD-ROM).    E                 
              Objective II:  Each of the teachers will develop and implement                 
              at least one comprehensive student-based project.  The projects                
              will promote problem solving, critical thinking, and                           
              communication skills, and integrate the use of the information                 
              technologies.  Over the three years of project support 120                     
              teachers, 30 student teachers, and 5,600 students at in grades 4               
              - 10 will become involved in the program.  The project                         
              leadership anticipates the involvement of an additional 5,000                  
              students in each of the three years following completion of the                
              NSF project.
