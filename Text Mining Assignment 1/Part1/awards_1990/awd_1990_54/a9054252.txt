Abstract    :
              The three week physical chemistry workshop is being conducted for              
              20 undergraduate physical chemistry instructors.  Its goal is to               
              introduce the participants to modern computational chemistry,                  
              state to state reaction dynamics, atmospheric chemistry, physical              
              chemistry of surfaces, and the principles and applications of                  
              superconductors.  Each participant is  committed to implementing               
              aspects of the summer workshop during the following academic year              
              and to reporting on the implementation to fellow participants and              
              to the project director.
