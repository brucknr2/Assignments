Abstract    :
              This workshop enhances the knowledge and instructional capability              
              of 80 undergraduate faculty members in the area of Computer                    
              Integrated Manufacturing (CIM).  Through experiential teaching                 
              methods, faculty participants drawn from institutions throughout               
              the USA are provided with an intensive overview of the CAM field.              
              Particular emphasis is placed on illustrating how these concepts               
              can be successfully introduced into undergraduate engineering                  
              curricula. Projects and demonstrations on CAM-related areas such               
              as  CAD/CAM, Computer Aided Management, Simulation Modeling, and               
              Expert Systems are included.  A conference in which participants               
              in previous summer projects interact with new faculty participants             
              and report on efforts to introduce CAM undergraduate curriculum                
              at their home institutions is part of the project as well.
