Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A CD-ROM is to be produced with materials which will give                      
              all physics teachers access to a large collection of                           
              information useful to their teaching physics.  The materials                   
              will include tricks-of-the-trade, demonstration examples,                      
              laboratory experiment suggestions, scientific equipment                        
              catalogues, textbook publishers, physics lesson plans,                         
              reprints of articles on teaching, articles about significant                   
              concepts, etc.  The source of the material will be Physics                     
              Teacher Resource Agents, AAPT, earlier commissions on                          
              college physics, out-of-print classics, commercial supply                      
              houses, etc.  The materials will be screened by a panel of                     
              teachers.  The CD-ROM will be evaluated by teachers of                         
              varying abilities.  A software package will be developed so                    
              that the information can be retrieved by both expert and                       
              novice teachers and also by students.  Extensive workshops                     
              to acquaint teachers with the use of the Tool-Kit are                          
              planned.
