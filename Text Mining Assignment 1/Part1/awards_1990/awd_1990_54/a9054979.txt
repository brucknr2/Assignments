Abstract    :
              This workshop brings together representatives of undergraduate                 
              Bioengineering curricula and others who have an interest and concern           
              with the quality of such undergraduate programs.  The workshop is a            
              2.5 day event meeting an important need to discuss common problems,            
              identify future directions and study possible avenues to                       
              significantly improve these programs. Participants in this workshop            
              will attend the first national meeting of this type since the first            
              undergraduate program was accredited in 1972.  The steering                    
              committee, consisting of four experienced Bioengineering Department            
              Heads, are directing sessions aimed at the curricula, the student,             
              curricula resources and networking. As a result of this workshop,              
              all bioengineering departments in this country will receive a copy             
              of the report with recommendations for action and responsible                  
              agencies or individuals.  Participants will contribute about 32% of            
              the award toward the operation of this project.
