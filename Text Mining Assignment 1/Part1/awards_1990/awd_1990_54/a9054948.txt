Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is a three year program that includes 1) the                      
              training of ten new two-member "Mentor Teacher" teams, and                     
              2) a series of twenty three, two-week workshops led by 16                      
              Mentor Teacher teams.  Mentor Teachers are previous                            
              participants in NSF sponsored leadership development                           
              projects in human genetics and bioethical decision-making                      
              held at Ball State University and conducted by the staff of                    
              the Human Genetics and Bioethics Educational Laboratory                        
              (HGABEL).                                                                      
                                                                                             
              Six, two-member, Mentor Teacher teams were trained with                        
              previous NSF funding.  The training of ten new teams will                      
              take place during the summers of 1991 and 1992 at Ball State                   
              University.  The Mentor Teacher led workshops will take                        
              place, nationwide, during the summers of 1991, 1992, and                       
              1993.  These workshops will be based upon an effective model                   
              workshop that was developed, tested, and evaluated by Mentor                   
              Teachers and HGABEL staff during three previous workshops                      
              involving 54 teachers and over 5300 students.                                  
                                                                                             
              The purpose of this program is to prepare over 550 high                        
              school biology teachers to 1) instruct their students about                    
              concepts in human genetics, and 2) develop student skills in                   
              bioethical decision making.  Workshops will emphasize hands-                   
              on experiences, many of which are directly applicable to the                   
              classroom.  Other pedagogical strategies employed will                         
              involve contemporary learning cycles and classroom behavior                    
              modeling by the Mentor Teachers.                                               
                                                                                             
              An amount equal to 62% of the NSF award will be provided as                    
              cost sharing.
