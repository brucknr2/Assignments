Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will develop a series of mathematics software                     
              programs for middle school students.  These programs are to                    
              develop skills in mathematics problem solving.  It has a specific              
              target: at-risk students in the middle school.  The goal is to                 
              develop a discovery based approach to enable students to explore               
              the types of information necessary to discover key procedures.                 
              Two types of software will be developed.  the first type is a                  
              toolkit which enable students to construct experiments on the                  
              relationships among different ways of expressing numbers.  the                 
              second type is word problem processors, which allow students to                
              generate varieties of word problems and speculate about                        
              similarities of the conditions under which the computer used a                 
              particular approach to solving a given problem.                                
                                                                                             
              In addition, lesson plans will be developed and published.  These              
              lessons are to guide the teachers in the use of the software.                  
              The lessons will be geared to existing software as well as the                 
              software being developed on the project.  The result will be a                 
              complete course of lessons.
