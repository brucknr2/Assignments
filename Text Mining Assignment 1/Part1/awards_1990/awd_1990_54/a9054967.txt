Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              This three year project, sponsored by Southern Illinois                        
              University-Carbondale, will teach middle school teachers                       
              science content and science-related social issues.  In the                     
              first year 22 key middle school teachers and eleven                            
              instructional supervisors will be involved.  In the second                     
              year 33 other teachers will be involved.  These participants                   
              will receive instruction in science content, investigate                       
              local STS issues and learn specific methods to teach middle                    
              school students these same skills.  Assisted by project                        
              staff the teachers in the program will provide inservice                       
              training to colleagues in other districts.  In the third                       
              year the prior participants, and administrators from their                     
              schools, will attend a one-week workshop relating to staff                     
              development and program implementation.  As a result of this                   
              project at the end of three years each district served will                    
              have in place a component of its science curriculum focused                    
              on science-related social issues, teachers trained in this                     
              issue-related approach, a cadre of key teachers and                            
              administrators who can provide training to new teachers as                     
              they move into the district and a staff development program                    
              designed for that particular district which will insure                        
              continuation of this program.  The matching funds provided                     
              by the University, Maryville College and the school                            
              districts are equal to 125% of the NSF grant.
