Abstract    :
              The project, jointly conducted by Georgia State University and the             
              Georgia Institute of Technology, is aimed at improving the ability             
              of faculty at two- and four- year institutions in Southeastern                 
              United States to teach a modern program in chemistry. Over a two               
              year period, the project is offering 10 one-week workshops and                 
              three 2-day minicourses. Workshop topics include: molecular                    
              modeling, chemistry of nucleic acids, polymers, chemometrics, and              
              instrument interfacing. Over the three year period 996 participant             
              days are scheduled. A compilation of all innovations in the course-            
              work at undergraduate colleges resulting from the project will be              
              distributed to all participants.
