              Abstract: This project provides support for printing and                       
              distributing 750 additional copies of the Proceedings of the St.               
              Cloud Conference on Women in Mathematics and Science held in                   
              November of 1989. That conference, supported by other than NSF                 
              funds, has become widely known as one of the most productive                   
              conferences held on this topic. The original grant only provided               
              for publishing and distributing the Proceedings to the participants            
              and a few others.
