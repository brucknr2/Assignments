Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project of the State University of New York at Oswego                     
              is entitled, "Kids at Work: School Science and Mathematics                     
              in the Workplace."  The program involves a partnership                         
              involving the Oswego County Schools, SUNY Oswego, and                          
              several local businesses.                                                      
                                                                                             
              This program builds on the base of Oswego's Project SMART                      
              (Science/Mathematics Resources for Teaching), which has                        
              implemented portions of a staff development program and has                    
              established a resource center.  As part of the teacher                         
              enhancement activities, the "Kids at Work" industrial field                    
              excursions were developed.  Local businesses host field                        
              trips for children from neighboring elementary schools.                        
              Teachers, college staff, and private sector partners work                      
              together to develop classroom activities for the children                      
              to do before and after the excursions; these activities are                    
              based upon exemplary materials developed through                               
              NSF-supported curriculum projects.   The project will be                       
              extended into the Syracuse area in its second year.
