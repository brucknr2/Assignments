              instructors from 2- and 4-year institutions in the technologically             
              impacted ocean sciences.  Course objectives are to provide state-              
              of-the-art information in marine research and applications; hands-             
              on experiences in oceanographic sample collecting and data                     
              analysis; and new instructional materials and techniques.                      
                                                                                             
              The forty participants earn three graduate semester units in Marine            
              Studies by participating in a variety of activities at the                     
              University, and at Scripps Institution of Oceanography (UCSD),                 
              Grossmont Community College, the coastal nuclear power station at              
              San Onofre, commercial aquiculture facilities, and Sea World/Hubbs             
              Research Institute.  Field excursions include data and sample                  
              collecting aboard the 125' R/V Gordon Sproul, site visits to                   
              classic exposures of sedimentary marine facies, and a voyage past              
              the Los Coronados Islands to Ensenada, Mexico, to the University               
              Autonomia de Baja California Marine Studies facilities.                        
                                                                                             
              The program presents a broad spectrum of ocean-related information             
              for undergraduate classrooms:  cutting edge scientific information,            
              instructional materials and software, and data on current marine               
              studies programs and employment possibilities.
