Abstract    :
                   Collaboration between NSF and CCSO to develop indicators of               
              science and mathematics education began in 1986.  The project was              
              initiated with two goals:  1) to establish a system of education               
              indicators that provides the capacity for national analyses and                
              state-by-state comparisons of the condition and trends in science              
              mathematics education, and 2) to improve the quality and                       
              usefulness of data on science and mathematics education to assist              
              the state policymakers and program managers in making more                     
              informed decisions.                                                            
                   The present proposal outlines four objectives for the next                
              phase of the state science/math indicators project:                            
              1.   Collect and report biannual national and state-by-state data              
                   on selected indicators of science and math education, based               
                   on data collected by state departments of education;                      
              2.   Produce and report state-by-state analyses of data on                     
                   science and math indicators from the Schools and Staffing                 
                   Survey of the National Center for Education Statistics;                   
              3.   Provide assistance to 5-10 states to develop capacity for                 
                   collecting and reporting data on science/math indicators;                 
              4.   Establish an "interstate consortium on alternative methods                
                   of student assessment" to assist states in reforming their                
                   assessments of student learning in science and mathematics.
