Abstract    :
              A novel approach to the design of experiments for the senior                   
              Chemical Engineering laboratory which--by combining computer                   
              simulations of real industrial processes and videotaped facilities             
              tours--will result in a laboratory experience which is more                    
              challenging, interesting, and educationally effective.                         
                                                                                             
              Five laboratory modules were completed with the financial support              
              of five industrial sponsors and NSF Undergraduate Curriculum                   
              Development Grant.  The materials (computer programs, videotapes,              
              written problem descriptions and instructors' manuals) are being               
              distributed, at cost, to all interested Chemical Engineering                   
              departments.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              Thirty selected faculty are participating in a three day workshop,             
              where all five modules are being presented and the participants are            
              being given hands-on experience with the materials.
