Abstract    :
              The NSF Summer Institute on Microscale Organic Laboratory                      
              Techniques is designed to assist faculty who contemplate                       
              undertaking this type of laboratory approach by introducing them               
              to the experimental methods involved.  The Institute is organized              
              around a framework of lecture-demonstrations, laboratory exercises,            
              and informal group discussions of microscale techniques.  "Hands-              
              on" laboratory experience is emphasized with particular attention              
              paid to manipulative procedures involved in preparation, isolation,            
              purification, and characterization of reaction products at the                 
              milligram level.                                                               
                                                                                             
              The first Summer Institute on Microscale Organic Laboratory                    
              Techniques was conducted in 1986 with funding from the Alfred P.               
              Sloan Foundation.  The NSF Undergraduate Faculty Enhancement                   
              Program funded the 1988 Institute.  Bowdoin has successfully                   
              supported the 1987 Institute and received funding for the 1989 and             
              1990 Institutes from the Pew Charitable Trust.
