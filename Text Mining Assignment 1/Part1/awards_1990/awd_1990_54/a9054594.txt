Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The West Irondequoit Central School District of Rochester, New                 
              York is conducting a Private Sector Partnership project to                     
              Improve Science and Mathematics Education in West Irondequoit                  
              Schools.  The project aims to motivate junior and senior high                  
              school students to choose technical careers in industry and                    
              manufacturing.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              The initial target group is 500 seventh and eighth grade                       
              students; 30% of these students are minority, 50% are female,and               
              12% are handicapped.  They are introduced to technology education              
              through the Manufacturing Technology Awareness Module (TAM).  TAM              
              will allow the students to explore such concepts as CAD/CAM, use               
              of robots in industry, applications of computers, and creative                 
              problem solving.  Students will be impressed with the necessity                
              of integrated study of math, science, and technology for solving               
              technical problems.
