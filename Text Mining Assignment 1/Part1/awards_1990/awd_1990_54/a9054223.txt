Abstract    :
              Despite the growing scientific and societal impact of human                    
              genetics, laboratory instruction on gene manipulation has not                  
              reached very far down the educational ladder and is mainly confined            
              to upper-level courses for biology majors.  The workshops enable               
              participants to introduce basic DNA manipulation laboratories   in             
              freshman survey courses and therefore stimulate broad DNA literacy             
              and influence students to select careers in biological science. The            
              workshops introduce teaching faculty to techniques of genome                   
              analysis and their applications to human genetics. After the 10 day            
              summer workshop, participants will attend a two day follow-up                  
              session the following winter.
