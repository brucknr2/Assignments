Abstract    :
              The one week workshop on lasers and the application to chemical                
              problems is providing exposure to laser technology for 12 chemistry            
              faculty.  The workshop is focussing on intensive exposure to both              
              the theory and practical application of laser technology to areas              
              of interest to all branches of chemistry.  The course includes                 
              lectures on the fundamentals of lasers and related topics;                     
              laboratory experiments to illustrate the principles presented in               
              the lectures; lectures and laboratory experiments dealing with                 
              current applications of lasers to chemically interesting problems;             
              and an opportunity to engage in a special project of interest to               
              the participant.  The technology is being transported to the                   
              participant's home institution.
