Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is to develop and test 20-24 videotape scenarios                  
              based on realistic problem-solving situations.  The tapes are to               
              be used in two ways: (1) as assessment tools to measure students'              
              problem-solving skills and beliefs, and (2) as instructional                   
              devices to promote problem solving.  The focus of the materials                
              will be on students' beliefs about problems and ways to solve                  
              them.                                                                          
                                                                                             
              The videotape scenarios will show children involved in a                       
              cooperative effort to solve real-life problems.  The tapes will                
              be used to develop the abilities of children in grades 4-6 to                  
              recognize problem situations, to develop problems from these                   
              situations, and then solve the problems.  Simultaneously, there                
              will be instruments developed to assess the students'                          
              understanding and dispositions about problem solving.                          
                                                                                             
              All material, including a user's guide, will be indexed to the                 
              NCTM standards.
