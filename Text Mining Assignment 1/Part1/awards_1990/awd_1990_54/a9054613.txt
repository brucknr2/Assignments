Abstract    :
              Three new field-based introductory science courses are being                   
              developed and implemented for students enrolled in American                    
              Samoa Community College: Environmental Science 120, Marine                     
              Biology 120, and Agricultural Science 120.  Each  course will                  
              be based in the islands unique tropical environment (the                       
              tropical rain forest, ocean shore and reefs, and tropical                      
              agriculture) to give students experience with a "living lab."                  
              Selected students will also participate in internships after                   
              completing the courses.  The project is a cooperative effort                   
              among the ASCC Math/Science divi`sion, ASCC Land Grant Program,                
              and American Samoa Government department of Marine and Wildlife
