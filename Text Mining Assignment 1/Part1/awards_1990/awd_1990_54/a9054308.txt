Abstract    :
              The Electronic Design Automation Workshop acquaints electrical                 
              engineering faculty with the overall methodology used in the design            
              of electronic circuits, from the development of a behavioral model             
              to its physical implementation.  The workshop provides an overview             
              of currently available computer workstation hardware and software              
              for electronic circuit schematic capture, simulation, component                
              layout, circuit routing, fabrication and testing, together with                
              guidance for implementing these capabilities in the undergraduate              
              curriculum.
