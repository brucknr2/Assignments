Abstract    :
              Two one week workshops, for twenty social scientists each, are                 
              being conducted. The workshops are covering techniques of                      
              exploratory data analysis using a statistical package particularly             
              suited for graphical forms of data analysis, "Stata."  Participants            
              are developing skills in using and teaching robust statistics,                 
              analytical graphics and data transformations. Exploratory data                 
              analytic techniques, such as data smoothing, median polishing, re-             
              scaling and transforming data using the ladder of powers, five                 
              number summaries, box and whisker plots, and stem and leaf charts,             
              are emphasized. The workshops also illustrate pedagogical methods              
              for teaching EDA techniques at the undergraduate level and                     
              establish a professional network of EDA-oriented faculty. The                  
              significance of the project to undergraduate faculty and students              
              lies in the use of exploratory data analysis techniques as                     
              interesting and useful alternatives to traditional confirmatory                
              statistics.
