Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              "IDEAS" is a three year program targeted at increasing                         
              retention of women engineering students during the Freshman to                 
              Junior years at the Milwaukee School of Engineering.  It is                    
              part of a vigorous effort to significantly increase the                        
              percentage of graduating women engineers by the year 2000.                     
              The five phases - Innovation, Discovery, Experience,                           
              Assimilation and Stretching cover the Prefreshman through                      
              Sophomore years.  Bonding, technological literacy, strong                      
              faculty/staff support, professional/work contacts and positive                 
              role models are being emphasized during this period of study                   
              for the students.  All women engineering students will                         
              participate in IDEAS, not only as students, but also as                        
              mentors.  IDEAS is being developed and managed by women faculty                
              and staff of the institution.
