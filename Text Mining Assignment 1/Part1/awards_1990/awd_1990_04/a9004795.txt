Abstract    :
              An integrated field and laboratory investigation is planned of                 
              garnet peridotites and eclogites in the Czech portion of the                   
              Bohemian Massif, which is the easternmost extent of the Variscan               
              Orogen in Europe.  These high-pressure rocks occur in sequence of              
              continental crustal rocks in the Moldanubian Zone, which is the                
              most internal and highly metamorphosed tectonostratigraphic unit               
              of the Variscan Orogen.  Previous studies have demonstrated:  1)               
              the occurrence of two types of garnet peridotites, which exhibit               
              different modes of origin, T-p histories, and cooling rates, and               
              2) a mantle origin for Group A eclogite lenses in peridotites,                 
              which formed by high-pressure crystal accumulation and were                    
              carried into the crust by enclosing peridotites that were                      
              tectonically emplaced during the Variscan Orogeny.                             
              Further isotopic investigations will be performed on selected                  
              peridotite and ecologite samples that have already been                        
              characterized petrologically, and integrated field, petrologic,                
              geochemical, and isotopic studies will be made of additional                   
              peridotite bodies and Group B eclogite lenses in gneisses.  The                
              results should provide a basis for establishing the timing and                 
              nature of high-pressure metamorphism in this portion of the                    
              Variscan belt, an improve our understanding of the complexities                
              involved in the interaction of mantle and crust during                         
              orogenesis.
