Abstract    :
                   This project involves the use of surgery theory to study                  
              symmetries of manifolds, with emphasis on finite groups of                     
              symmetries of the sphere.  The project includes four parts.  The               
              first part studies the role of the rational numbers in geometric               
              topology and surgery theory, and in particular aims at the                     
              determination of the rational homotopy types of manifolds with                 
              finite fundamental group.  The second part involves a mix of knot              
              theory and high-dimensional techniques, and this mix could lead                
              to an interesting synthesis.  The third part examines connections              
              between group actions and numerical invariants in L-theory, which              
              in turn leads to number theory.  Finally the last part is                      
              algebraic considerations in L-theory and Galois cohomology.  Such              
              interactions between algebra and topology have been quite                      
              fruitful in the past.
