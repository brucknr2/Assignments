Abstract    :
              The objectives of this investigation are to develop inversion                  
              principles, data acquisition strategies, and information processing            
              algorithms for an echo imaging system that utilizes the motion of              
              a single element transducer (SET) to synthesize the effect of a                
              phased array with a size equal to the path length that the SET                 
              traverses.  A mobile SET, with a dimension much smaller than a                 
              phased array's size, brings flexibility in data acquisition and                
              processing for echo imaging systems.  Synthetic aperture echo                  
              imaging also opens ways for imaging an object that cannot be                   
              studies with phased arrays due to constraints imposed by the                   
              object's anatomy.                                                              
                                                                                             
              Unlike the dynamic focusing inversion used in conjunction with                 
              stationary phased arrays, the proposed inversion produces an image             
              scene by integrating the recorded echoed signals at the available              
              coordinates of the mobile SET that possesses a wide-beam radiation             
              pattern.  The investigation includes modifying an inversion                    
              developed for a translational or rotational SET for practical echo             
              imaging problems that arise in diagnostic medicine, remote sensing             
              and non-destructive testing.  The required sampling and processing             
              issues associated with the recorded data as well as the resolution             
              anticipated in a given synthetic aperture echo imaging problem are             
              also studied.  The result will be used to develop efficient data               
              collection strategies for two-dimensional and three-dimensional                
              echo imaging systems.  Sub-band processing of the available spatial            
              frequency data to reduce the computational time for image                      
              reconstruction is also being pursued.
