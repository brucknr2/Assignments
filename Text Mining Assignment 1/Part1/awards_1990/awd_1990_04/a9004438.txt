Abstract    :
              Silicate melts are the essence of igneous petrology and play an                
              important role in the thermal evolution of the terrestrial                     
              planets.  Unfortunately, silicate melts are difficult materials                
              to study experimentally, theoretically and numerically.  At the                
              same time, computer simulations on supercomputers are gaining                  
              prominence in the earth sciences.  The research described below                
              is a collaborative effort between D.A. Yuen and F.J. Spera in the              
              molecular modeling of molten germania (GeO2).  The principal aim               
              is to attempt to explain the properties of GeO2 melt, a classic                
              network structure fluid, on the basis of intermolecular forces.                
              Because GeO2 is an excellent analog of network silicate melts                  
              relevant to high temperature geochemistry (e.g., molten                        
              SiO2 NaAlSl2O6) and is potentially easier to simulate using                    
              molecular dynamics, a greater understanding of the chemical                    
              bonding, thermodynamic and transport properties of molten GeO2                 
              will help  us in turn to understand silicates better.
