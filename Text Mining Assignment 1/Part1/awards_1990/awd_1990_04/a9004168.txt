Abstract    :
              The mathematical theory of sets first developed in response to deep            
              problems in the foundations of the calculus and the theory of                  
              functions.  After considerable initial success, progress in these              
              areas came to an abrupt halt and an number of natural open problems            
              stubbornly resisted solution.  The explanation came only later; in             
              fact, these problems cannot be answered on the basis of the                    
              standard axioms.  This discovery led to a search for new axioms,               
              and today's set theorists are faced with two distinct theories,                
              theories that provide opposing answers to many of the previously               
              open problems.  The question of which of these theories is true is             
              not strictly mathematical; one isn't looking for a proof.  Previous            
              axioms were judged on their purported "obviousness", but the                   
              current candidates enjoy no such status.  Thus a novel                         
              methodological problem arises:  how can such hypotheses be judged?             
                                                                                             
              Professor Maddy's goal is to provide a philosophical analysis of               
              the nature of this question -- is such-and-such a an axiom                     
              candidate true? -- and to delineate that range of methods                      
              appropriate to answering it.  She will then apply these methods to             
              one particular new axiom candidate:  the assumption that all sets              
              are constructible.  This research is of great importance for the               
              philosophy of science and foundational studies of mathematics.
