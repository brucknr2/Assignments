Abstract    :
                                                                                              
               The University of North Florida will connect their campus                    
              network to SURAnet (Southeastern Universities Research                         
              Association network, a regional network which is part of the                   
              NSFNET).  Direct connection to SURAnet will provide researchers                
              with improved access to national networks such as CSNET/Bitnet                 
              and USENET.  Improvement is sought in reliability, speed, turn-                
              around, flexibility, and functions such as file transfer, remote               
              login, and teleconferencing.                                                   
                                                                                             
                The University of North Florida will join the Florida State                  
              University System's FIRN InterLAN project by linking to SURAnet.               
              This project provides sharing of resources among the nine state                
              institutions.  This link will greatly facilitate research by                   
              students and faculty, and will provide a valuable resource to                  
              supplement course work.
