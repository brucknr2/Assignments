Abstract    :
              This award will support study of the Japanese language by an                   
              American scientist or engineer by providing a stipend, tuition, or             
              other course-related expenses.  The objectives of the program are              
              to enable active U.S. scientists and engineers to acquire sufficient           
              familiarity with the language and customs of Japan to allow them               
              to function independently there; or to acquire sufficient expertise            
              in reading Japanese to be able to understand technical abstracts               
              in their field of interest.                                                    
                                                                                             
              There is a critical need for more effective technical communication            
              between American and Japanese researchers.  This award is intended             
              to help remove language and cultural barriers to U.S.-Japanese                 
              cooperative research and to facilitate science and technology                  
              exchange.
