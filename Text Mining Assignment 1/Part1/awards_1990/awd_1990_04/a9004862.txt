Abstract    :
                   This award provides matching funds that will be applied                   
              toward the purchase of a new generation, sensitive, high-                      
              resolution ion microprobe to be installed and operated in the                  
              Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at the University of                
              California, Los Angeles. UCLA is committed to matching more than               
              50% of the acquisition costs of this equipment.                                
                   The need to better understand the evolution of the Earth and              
              its natural resources requires continual advances in the ability               
              to characterize the geochemical properties of Earth materials,                 
              and isotope geochemistry in particular has made outstanding                    
              contributions by permitting age dating of materials and events in              
              Earth history and the use of isotope tracers for delineating the               
              transfer of material during both local- and global-scale                       
              processes. The new generation instrument to be acquired through                
              this award will extend existing capabilities in the U.S. for                   
              isotopic analysis of Earth materials by permitting micron-scale,               
              in-situ, isotopic analyses with detection limits in the part per               
              billion range. The instrument will be the centerpiece of a                     
              facility that will be open to earth scientists outside of UCLA                 
              and will permit the fullest application of recent instrumental                 
              developments to a better understanding of the origin and                       
              evolution of the crust and the genesis of mineral resources.
