Abstract    :
              Recently it has become clear from a variety of field observations              
              that downstream size decrease in aggrading river systems is caused             
              in large part by selective deposition of coarse clasts.  However,              
              sorting by selective deposition has never been studied                         
              systematically under controlled conditions.  The absence of a set              
              of reference data on downstream sorting is even more striking in               
              light of the number of theories that have been advanced recently               
              to explain it.  The main goal of the proposed project is to carry              
              out a series of basic experiments on selective transport and                   
              deposition in poorly sorted gravelly sediments.  Most of the                   
              experiments will be conducted in a large channel at the St. Anthony            
              Falls Hydraulic Laboratory.  There we will produce deposits from               
              a poorly sorted sand-gravel mix over a distance of about 50 m.  The            
              main variables will be rate of sediment feed (and hence                        
              deposition), and channel form (straight, weakly sinuous, braided).             
              In addition we will make detailed measurements of sediment                     
              transport and surface texture in a smaller flume at Johns Hopkins              
              University.  These data will be used to develop surface-based                  
              transport formulas that will be used in modeling the sorting                   
              observed in the large flume.
