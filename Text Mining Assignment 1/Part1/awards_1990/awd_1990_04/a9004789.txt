Abstract    :
                   Just prior to and immediately after the mass extinctions                  
              used to mark the end of the Cretaceous eutherian (placental)                   
              mammals underwent a major evolutionary radiation.  Systematic                  
              analyses of these mammals, based on their gross dental                         
              morphology (the primary suite of characters available for                      
              analysis), have resulted in neither full clarification of their                
              phylogenetic interrelationships nor in understanding of the                    
              adaptive (functional) differences that contributed to the                      
              radiation.  Learning and applying the techniques involved in                   
              analysis of the microstructure of mammalian enamel will provide                
              an additional suite of characters that can be used to address                  
              these problems and research techniques that can be passed on to                
              graduate students who are faced with similar problems in their                 
              research.  A sabbatical leave during the academic year 1990-1991               
              and an invitation to work in the laboratory of Professor Dr.                   
              Wighart von Koenigswald, Director of the Palaontologisches                     
              Institut der Universitat Bonn (BRD). will provide a new research               
              environment, time to learn new research techniques and the                     
              opportunity to take a fresh approach to research on the patterns               
              and causal factors of the early radiation of eutherian mammals.
