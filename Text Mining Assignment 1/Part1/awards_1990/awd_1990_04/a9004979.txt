Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project aims to characterize the  11 desaturases of the                   
              cabbage looper moth.  Specifically, the DNA sequence of the                    
              gene for this enzyme will be determined and compared with                      
              similar sequences isolated from desaturase genes in other                      
              moth species.  It is intended subsequently to extend this                      
              work to examine the  10 desaturases in primitive lepidoptera                   
              and then to move on to other genes that encode other enzymes                   
              involved in pheromone biosynthesis.                                            
                                                                                             
              Sex pheromones are chemical compounds that play a crucial                      
              role in insect reproduction.  Major components of these                        
              pheromones are synthesized in female sex pheromone glands.                     
              In this research the principal investigators build on                          
              detailed knowledge of pheromone biochemistry by addressing                     
              the structure and regulation of the genes encoding these                       
              enzymes.  The work employs new techniques of molecular                         
              biology and should considerably broaden our present horizons                   
              about the pheromone communication system so as to provide a                    
              basis for gene manipulation in connection with novel insect                    
              control strategies.***//
