Abstract    :
                   Air Conditioning is regarded as a necessity by modern society.            
              The development of more efficient Chlorofluorocarbon (CFC)                     
              refrigerant free air conditioners is an extremely important goal               
              for the air conditioning industry.  This proposal proposes the                 
              creation of a university industrial cooperative research center to             
              contribute to the technology base for a new generation of equipment            
              which will reduce and ultimately eliminate reliance on CFCs and to             
              provide an opportunity for manufacturers to coordinate research                
              and share results, increasing competitiveness on an international              
              scale.                                                                         
                   The Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for                   
              Advanced Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Technology will perform            
              research on air conditioning and heating components including heat             
              exchanges, compressors and alternative components and will also                
              address system problems associated with mobile Air Conditioning                
              Systems, Domestic Refrigeration Freezers and General Heatpump and              
              Refrigeration Systems.                                                         
                   This project has been coordinated with Dr. William                        
              Grosshandler, Program Director for Thermal Systems Engineering in              
              CTS Division.                                                                  
                   The Program Manager recommends that the University of Illinois            
              at Urbana be awarded $95,000 for the first year of a five year                 
              continuing grant.  $50,000 is to be provided by NSF and $40,000 by             
              the U.S. EPA via an Interagency Agreement.                                     
                   In addition this award provides $5,000 for a woman,                       
              undergraduate research assistant for one year under the NSF Women,             
              Minority, and Disabled Engineering Research Assistants Program.                
              The student will augment the research of the Center by studying and            
              analyzing domestic refrigerator-freezers to determine the impact               
              of new refrigerants on system performance.                                     
                   Near the end of each twelve month period, the Program Manager             
              and/or the Directors of the Engineering Centers Division reviews               
              the progress of the center on a number of renewal criteria,                    
              including the following:  (1) extent to which the                              
              University/Industry interaction and collaboration is developing;               
              (2) extent to which the support base for the center is expanding;              
              (3) extent to which a robust research program is developing.  If               
              the review is satisfactory, the Program Manager will recommend                 
              support of the next period of this continuing grant.
