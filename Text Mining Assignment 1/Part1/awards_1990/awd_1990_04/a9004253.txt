Abstract    :
                   This project involves research in ergodic theory.  Ergodic                
              theory in general concerns understanding the average behavior of               
              systems whose dynamics is too complicated or chaotic to be                     
              followed in microscopic detail.  The particular work to be                     
              undertaken by Professors Lind and Tuncel is in the area of                     
              "symbolic dynamics".  A symbolic dynamical system is a collection              
              of two-way infinite strings of symbols from a finite alphabet.                 
              These strings satisfy a formation rule which specifies which                   
              symbols are allowed to follow which as one moves along the                     
              string.  Symbolic dynamical systems have recently found                        
              widespread application in the modelling of data transmission.                  
                   Some of the particular areas of investigation will involve                
              the dynamics of commuting automorphisms of compact groups, the                 
              construction of Markov partitions using self-similar tilings of                
              the plane, and codings and invariants of Markov chains. The work               
              stresses interactions between the fields of ergodic theory,                    
              algebra, and geometry.
