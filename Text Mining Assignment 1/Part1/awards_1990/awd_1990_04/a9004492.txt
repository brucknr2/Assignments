Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research permits Dr. Minze Stuiver, together with colleagues              
              from other laboratories, to conduct radiocarbon determinations on              
              a series of German and Irish oak trees, which date from between                
              ca. 5,000 and 8,000 B.C.  The absolute ages of tree rings within               
              this sample are independently determined through the construction              
              of an annual ring chronology which starts at the present and                   
              works back into the past.  With these new determinations, Dr.                  
              Stuiver will construct a series of calibrations which will allow               
              the accurate conversion of radio carbon years into true age.                   
              Although the two are closely correlated they are not identical.                
              Using this technique calibrations have been established from the               
              present back to 5,000 B.C., and this project will extend this by               
              approximately another 3,000 years.                                             
                                                                                             
              Because of the complicated relationship between "radiocarbon age"              
              and "true age," sometimes materials with different true ages can               
              give the same radiocarbon age.  At some radiocarbon ages, the                  
              possible range of true ages can be smaller and at others larger.               
              For archaeologists these discrepancies can be extremely important              
              when comparisons are made from one culture area to another.  For               
              the more recent period, Dr. Stuiver's calibration curve allows                 
              one to correct for this, and it is important that this be                      
              extended further back in time.                                                 
                                                                                             
              This research is important not only to archaeologists but to                   
              astronomers and geophysicists, since the data provides                         
              information about changes in both solar radiation and in the                   
              earth's magnetic field.
