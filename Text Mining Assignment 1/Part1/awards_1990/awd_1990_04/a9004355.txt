Abstract    :
              The research performed under this award will include performance               
              evaluation and design for communication networks of the future,                
              particularly large, high-speed optical networks.  The main topics              
              are 1) improved bounds and approximations for circuit-switched                 
              networks, 2) dynamic local routing strategies, 3) massively                    
              parallel switching algorithms, 4) optical interconnection patterns,            
              and 5) computation with unreliable components.  The approach                   
              includes modeling, analysis, and design.  The models will be based             
              on current and anticipated future technology and will cover the                
              spectrum of networks from circuit-switched to datagram packet                  
              networks.  Analysis will consist of a mixture of exact                         
              probabilistic methods and simulation.  Design will be motivated by             
              modeling and analysis and aided by optimization tools of both                  
              combinatorial and nonlinear iterative types. Inequalities from                 
              information theory, mathematical physics, decision theory, and                 
              combinatorics will be applied to yield new performance bounds,                 
              providing a bridge between design and performance evaluation.
