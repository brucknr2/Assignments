Abstract    :
                This research is to do seismological studies of the thermal                  
              regime and dynamics of mid-ocean ridges and oceanic lithosphere                
              and asthenosphere.  The state of stress will be investigated by                
              means of source mechanisms of earthquakes.  Lateral heterogeneity              
              of oceanic structure will be determined from studies of S, SS,                 
              and P-wave travel times.  The objectives are to understand the                 
              relation of earthquake seismicity and source characteristics to                
              the thermal and mechanical structure of oceanic lithosphere, to                
              determine the 3-D seismic structure of the lithosphere and                     
              asthenosphere beneath the oceans, and to relate both types of                  
              observations to specific models for the processes of seafloor                  
              spreading and mantle convection.
