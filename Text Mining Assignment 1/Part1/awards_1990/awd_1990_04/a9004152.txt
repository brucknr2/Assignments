Abstract    :
              This grant is for continuing operation of the campus part of the               
              Berkeley Center for Isotope Geochemistry.  The research emphasis               
              is on using isotopic and trace element measurements to elucidate               
              the nature of solid earth geochemical cycles; in particular the                
              focus is on processes related to the differentiation and                       
              evolution of continental lithosphere and its relationship to the               
              structure and evolution of the mantle.  The research includes                  
              field, laboratory, experimental and theoretical components.                    
              Analytical work includes measurements of isotope ratios of Ca,                 
              Nd, Sr, Pb, O and H on geological materials using clean chemistry              
              laboratories and high precision mass spectrometric measurements.               
              Activities proposed for the grant period are:  (1) measurements                
              of Ca isotopic ratios in island arc rocks and continental                      
              granitic rocks; (2) studies of crustal and mantle xenoliths in a               
              transect from unrifted to recently extended craton to establish                
              the nature of deep lithospheric modification during extension;                 
              (3) studies of the temporal evolution of basalt source regions                 
              during continental extension; (4) pilot studies of granitic                    
              petrogenesis in the USSR; (5) mathematical modelling of                        
              fluid-rock interaction and magmatic processes.
