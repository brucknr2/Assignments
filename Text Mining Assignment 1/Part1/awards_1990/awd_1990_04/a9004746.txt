Abstract    :
              This research program is focused on three inter-related                        
              questions concerning regulation of muscle contraction:  the                    
              molecular basis for calcium-dependent control by myosin, the                   
              role of protein phosphorylation and filament architecture in                   
              regulating long-lasting contractions, and the structure and                    
              dynamics of the calcium-pumping protein assembly in the                        
              sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane.  In each case, the goal is to                 
              relate the detailed structure and properties of individual                     
              protein molecules to the architecture and dynamics of the                      
              native protein assemblies in muscle.  Drs. Vibert and Cohen                    
              have established that certain invertebrate muscles are                         
              especially suitable for these investigations, and that their                   
              structural and regulatory properties are of general                            
              significance for contraction in many muscle types, including                   
              those of vertebrates.  In the next phase of this program,                      
              application of advanced methods of electron microscopy -                       
              especially cryo-electron microscopy of vitrified samples -                     
              should provide images of higher resolution and fidelity than                   
              have been produced in the past.  Coupled with the use of                       
              proteins altered by site-directed mutagenesis, and of specific                 
              antibodies, these structural approaches should allow them to                   
              integrate findings at the molecular level into a picture of                    
              regulation in whole muscle.  Knowledge of the structure and                    
              switching of the protein assemblies that regulate muscle                       
              contraction involves understanding inter-related control                       
              systems at a higher level of organization than any yet                         
              achieved.
