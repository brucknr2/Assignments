Abstract    :
                   This award provides one-half the funds required to acquire                
              three Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers whose use will be              
              shared between scientists at the Lamont-Doherty Geological                     
              Observatory of Columbia University and the University NAVSTAR                  
              Consortium (UNAVCO). Columbia will provide the remaining funds                 
              needed for the purchase of the instruments and UNAVCO will                     
              provide maintenance and repair services for the instrument                     
              packages.                                                                      
                   The GPS receivers are capable of rapid and accurate geodetic              
              measurements with errors of less than a centimeter over baselines              
              of hundreds of kilometers and will be used in a variety of                     
              research projects related to plate tectonics and earthquake                    
              studies.
