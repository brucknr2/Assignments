Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              During the differentiation of B and T-lymphocytes, antibody and                
              T-cell antigen receptor genes undergo a complicated series of                  
              recombination events.  All of the antigen receptor variable                    
              region genes contain a pair of highly conserved recombination                  
              signal sequences which are the targets of a site-specific                      
              recombinase.  In an attempt to identify and characterize the                   
              factors involved in this recombination process, Dr. Aguilera has               
              sought nuclear factors which might interact specifically with the              
              recombination signals.  With the use of sensitive electrophoretic              
              assays, DNA binding factors have been identified in                            
              recombination-positive pre-B cells which bind specifically to the              
              V-(D)-J recombination signals.  The next goals of this research                
              are:  (1) To further characterize the lymphocyte nuclear factors               
              which interact specifically with the recombination signals; (2)                
              To  continue experiments leading to the purification of these                  
              binding factors; (3) To clone and characterize the genes encoding              
              nuclear factors which interact with the V-(D)-J recombination                  
              signals.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              The long term objective of this research is the characterization               
              of the enzymatic machinery involved in antigen receptor gene                   
              recombination in cells of the immune system.  These events                     
              underlie the generation of the vast diversity of specific                      
              receptor molecules that recognize and enable an individual to                  
              develop an immune response to a wide array of foreign substances.
