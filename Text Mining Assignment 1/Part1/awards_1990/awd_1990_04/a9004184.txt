Abstract    :
              The proposed program of research is designed to improve our                    
              understanding of the chemical evolution of seawater during the last            
              600 m.y. of Earth history.  To accomplish this, we plan to extend              
              our analytical data base for the chemical composition of brines in             
              fluid inclusions trapped in halite (NaCl) in marine evaporites.                
              Many of these brines are samples of the solutions from which the               
              salt precipitated.  In marine evaporites these brines are largely              
              or entirely derived from seawater; their composition therefore                 
              reflects the composition of seawater at the time of salt                       
              precipitation.  In many instances the evolution of these brines                
              from seawater has been so complicated, that little information                 
              regarding the composition of the parent seawater can be gained from            
              the composition of the inclusion fluids.  Fortunately, the                     
              evolution of the brines in some marine evaporites has been                     
              sufficiently simple, so that much of the chemistry of the starting             
              seawater can be reconstructed.  The data accumulated to date                   
              indicate that the composition of seawater has been surprisingly                
              conservative during the past 600 m.y.  At present these data are               
              still fragmentary.  We propose to extend them considerably, and to             
              construct a reasonably complete record of the composition of                   
              seawater during the Phanerozoic Eon.
