Abstract    :
              A series of X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (XAFS) experiments is              
              proposed, to measure the local structure about substituted atoms               
              in high-Tc superconductors.  Such experiments should furnish                   
              significant help in understanding the unique role that copper                  
              plays in these materials.  In addition, they propose preliminary               
              experiments on single crystal or oriented films and substituted-               
              materials using the high polarization of synchrotron radiation to              
              enhance the amplitude of the XAFS signal for particular bond                   
              directions.
