Abstract    :
                   Four aspects of the biology of Recent stalked crinoids in                 
              the Straits of Florida are examined as they contribute to                      
              understanding paleoecological processes: 1) niche partitioning of              
              habitat and food among four species distributed as three                       
              sympatric pairs--does it support or refute tiering, hydrodynamic               
              and food partitioning hypotheses proposed for fossil taxa.                     
              Measured variables include current velocity, stalk height, crown               
              diameter, filter density, gut contents and available food; 2)                  
              larval recruitment contributions to aggregated versus scattered                
              populations; contributions of recruitment and relocation of                    
              vagile adults in re-establishing aggregations following physical               
              disturbance; 3) relationship between possible behavioral                       
              patterns (feeding, activity or locomotory patterns or cycles) and              
              variations in current regime and 4) skeletal contributions of                  
              Recent crinoids to sediment as an analogue for depositional                    
              processes in ancient crinoidal sediments--analyses of post-mortem              
              processes and potential preservational biases.  Work will be                   
              conducted via submersible, time-lapse cinematography,                          
              morphological, photographic and sedimentological analyses of                   
              collected material.  Isocrininds represent major components of                 
              macroepibenthic assemblages in the study area and have a fossil                
              record dating to the Triassic.  As such, they represent an                     
              excellent analogue for paleoecological processes.
