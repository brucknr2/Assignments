Abstract    :
                   This work will focus on mathematical problems arising in the              
              theory of quasiconformal maps and harmonic analysis.                           
              Quasiconformal maps are smooth univalent transformations of                    
              planar (or higher dimensional) domains in which the distortion -               
              called the dilatation - is controlled.  Such maps occur as                     
              solutions of a partial differential equation called the Beltrami               
              equation.  One goal of the research will be to find new                        
              characterizations for quasiconformality in terms of oscillation                
              functions, maximal functions and doubling measures.  These are                 
              concepts taken from other parts of mathematical analysis in which              
              certain analytic hypotheses are usually assumed.  Part of this                 
              effort will be to consider how the geometry of quasiconformal                  
              maps can be used to reduce the requirements of analyticity.                    
                   A second line of investigation will continue research on the              
              problem of describing domains which can be the image of a disk                 
              under a quasiconformal transformation.  Such domains, quasidisks,              
              cannot be arbitrary.  Their boundaries cannot have cusps, for                  
              instance.  Insight into the structure of quasidisks, will provide              
              important information into the nature of any image domain under                
              quasiconformal mapping.
