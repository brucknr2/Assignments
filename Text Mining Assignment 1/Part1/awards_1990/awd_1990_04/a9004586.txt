Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The principal investigator will study three problems in the               
              area of dynamical systems.  These involve geometric Lorenz                     
              attractors for systems of equations derived from mathematical                  
              physics, the structure of the standard map for large values of                 
              the parameter, and cocycles over an irrational rotation and                    
              Schrodinger operators with quasi-periodic coefficients.                        
                   Dynamical systems is the mathematics of how objects move.                 
              The Lorenz system of differential equations describes motion in                
              three dimensions.  The principal investigator has proven that a                
              systems similar to the Lorenz system displays chaotic behavior                 
              and has a "strange attractor."  He will extend the techniques                  
              used to find this attractor to a wider class of differential                   
              equations.
