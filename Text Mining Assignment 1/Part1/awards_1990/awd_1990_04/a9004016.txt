Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Funds are requested for partial support for the 23rd Annual                    
              Meeting of the Northwest Regional Developmental Biology                        
              Conference to be held May 10-12, 1990 in the conference                        
              facilities at the Friday Harbor Laboratories of the University of              
              Washington. The format for the meeting will consist of Plenary                 
              session, platform sessions, symposia, and poster sessions. A                   
              major purpose of the meeting is to provide an educational                      
              experience for young scientists. The small size, informal                      
              atmosphere and physical isolation promote communication among                  
              graduate students, post doctoral fellows, and faculty members. It              
              also provides a forum for graduate students to present their work              
              in a relatively low stress, yet scientifically rigorous,                       
              environment.
