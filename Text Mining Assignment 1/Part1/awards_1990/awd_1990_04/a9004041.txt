Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Early neurogenesis in Drosophila establishes neural and epidermal              
              cell lineages from an apparently homogeneous ectodermal                        
              population.  Recent molecular and genetic evidence has                         
              demonstrated that this process is regulated by a small number of               
              zygotic genes, termed the neurogenic loci.  One of these genes,                
              "mastermind (mam)," has not been well characterized in terms of                
              how it functions and interacts with the other neurogenic loci.                 
              The specific aims of this research will be to 1) localize mam                  
              mRNA and protein on the cellular and subcellular levels                        
              throughout development, as an aid to understanding function; 2)                
              examine the genetic interactions between mam and other loci,                   
              determining the sequences of interesting mam mutations that                    
              affect the other loci; and 3) sequence alternative transcription               
              products of mam to determine whether the gene codes for more than              
              one protein, and to detect possible homologies to previously                   
              characterized molecules in invertebrates and vertebrates.
