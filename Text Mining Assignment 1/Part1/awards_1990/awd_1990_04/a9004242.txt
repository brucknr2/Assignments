Abstract    :
                   In this study, Dr. Michael Arnold and his colleagues will                 
              analyze natural hybridization between the Louisiana iris species,              
              I.fulva and I.hexagona.  The genetic interaction between these                 
              two species has been used as the classic example of the process                
              of interspecific gene flow.  In order to study the pattern of                  
              transfer of genetic material between these two species, the                    
              investigators have established an experimental hybrid population               
              in southern Louisiana.  Individuals of I. hexagona were                        
              introduced into a natural population of I. Fulva and were allowed              
              to flower during the spring of 1990.  Leaf material and seeds                  
              have been collected from each of the flowering individuals of                  
              both species.  Genetic markers that are diagnostic for either I.               
              fulva or I. hexagona will be examined using material isolated                  
              form the leaf and seed samples.  This will allow a test to                     
              determine whether or not hybrids have been formed and whether                  
              hybridization occurs bi-directionally (ie., with I. fulva and I.               
              hexagona acting both maternal and paternal parents).  These data               
              will allow an estimate of the effects of natural selection on                  
              hybridization between these two species by comparing the                       
              proportion of interspecific versus intraspecific offspring that                
              are produced.
