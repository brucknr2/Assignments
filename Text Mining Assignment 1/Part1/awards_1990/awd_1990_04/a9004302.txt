Abstract    :
                   Garnet is a common metamorphic mineral in many medium and                 
              high-grade terranes.  This project will explore the possibility                
              that U, Pb, Nd and Sm are sufficiently immobile in garnet that if              
              an age progression from core to rim of garnets can be observed,                
              it may be equated to growth during active prograde metamorphism.               
              If successful, garnet growth age information can be combined                   
              with geothermometry to follow the rate of temperature change                   
              during metamorphism.  The project will evaluate the blocking                   
              temperatures for the diffusion of U, Pb, Nd and Sm in calcic and               
              iron-rich garnets, and will examine zoned garnets from two well-               
              studied areas of high grade metamorphism - the Grenville of                    
              Ontario and New York and the Archean Pikwitonei Domain of                      
              Manitoba.  Results, if successful will provide a method to                     
              determine heating rates in high temperature metamorphism, a                    
              parameter that has considerable importance in orogenic studies                 
              but can not be measured or satisfactorily estimated at present.
