Abstract    :
                   Hempel and his graduate students are engaged in several                   
              related projects concerning the topology and geometry of                       
              manifolds of dimensions two and three.  The ultimate goals of                  
              this research are progress towards the classification and                      
              homeomorphism problems for 3-manifolds.  The techniques involve a              
              study of the (immersed and/or embedded) incompressible surfaces                
              in a 3-manifold, a study of branched covering spaces, and a study              
              of the mapping class group of surfaces.  The projects include:                 
              (1) A study of the lattice of all (closed, oriented) 3-manifolds               
              as branched covers of the 3-sphere, branched over some fixed                   
              universal link, e.g., the figure-eight knot.  (2) The development              
              of a theory of complexity for normal subgroups of fundamental                  
              groups of surfaces directed towards questions of existence,                    
              reducibility, etc. for Heegaard splittings of 3-manifolds.                     
                   Three-dimensional manifolds are the next simplest geometric               
              objects after surfaces (two-dimensional manifolds), but while                  
              surfaces have long been classified up to topological equivalence,              
              the same problem for 3-manifolds is very much alive and obviously              
              far more complicated.
