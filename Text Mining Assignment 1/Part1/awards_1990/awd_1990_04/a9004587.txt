Abstract    :
              Diverse populations of low molecular weight RNAs, found in both                
              prokaryotic and eukaryotic organsims, have been shown to play                  
              important roles in a wide variety of cellular processes including              
              DNA replication, RNA transcription and processing, and mRNA                    
              translation.  This laboratory's research efforts are focused on the            
              structure and function of one such small nuclear RNA designated                
              snRNA U14.  This evolutionarily conserved eukaryotic lmwRNA species            
              possesses a conserved ability to intermolecularly base-pair with               
              18s ribosomal RNA.   Molecular and cellular characterization of                
              mouse and Xenopus U14 as well as genetic analysis of yeast U14                 
              strongly indicate a role in eukaryotic rRNA synthesis and/or                   
              processing.  Recent experiments have quite surprisingly revealed               
              the positioning of the mouse and Xenopus U14 genes within intron               
              5 of the constitutive-expressed cognate hsc70 heat shock gene, a               
              unique genomic organization for an snRNA.                                      
              The experiments outlined in this investigation will examine the                
              synthesis, structure, and function of eukaryotic snRNA U14.  The               
              biosynthetic pathway responsible for U14 biogenesis defined.  The              
              synthesis and cellular distribution of U14 will be studied in both             
              normally and abnormally growing cells.  U14's role in rRNA                     
              processing as well as possible involvement in the heat shock/stress            
              response will be examined.  Finally, structural studies will define            
              an evolutionarily conserved U14 secondary structure, determine                 
              those U14/18s rRNA sequences involved in intermolecular                        
              hybridization, and characterize the U14-associated proteins of a               
              putative U14 ribonucleoprotein complex.  Results from these studies            
              will lead to a better understanding of the structure/function                  
              relationships of this unique and evolutionarily important                      
              eukaryotic lmwRNA.***//
