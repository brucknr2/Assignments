Abstract    :
              This research has two primary goals:  1. to compare rigorously                 
              eight different techniques used for determining the exposure-ages              
              of geomorphic surfaces;  2. to understand the timing of alluvial               
              fan aggradation on the bajada below the eastern Sierra Nevada.                 
              During the first year of the project, cores will be collected from             
              boulders on a chronologic sequence of five geomorphic surfaces for             
              which exposure-ages are constrained by previous geologic                       
              investigation.  For each boulder and surface, model exposure-ages              
              will be calculated from the measured accumulation of different                 
              cosmogenic isotopes produced in situ including 3He, 10Be, 36Cl, and            
              in some cases 26Al and 14C.  After comparing the ages obtained from            
              isotopic methods with existing ages estimates, varnish cation-ratio            
              and radiocarbon ages, and 10Be accumulation in soils, the most                 
              appropriate system(s) for determining the temporal and spatial                 
              distribution of alluvial fan aggradation will be chosen, also,                 
              there will be an intensive study of two drainages in the eastern               
              Sierra Nevada, one glaciated, the other unglaciated.  To determine             
              if glaciation and fan aggradation were synchronous, the abundance              
              of cosmogenic isotopes and calculate model exposure-ages for                   
              samples taken from boulders on fan surfaces and glacial moraines               
              will be obtained.  Age-data gathered in the second year of this                
              study will provide a direct and important link between the marine              
              isotope and terrestrial records of climate change.  Because of the             
              inter-disciplinary project team and because this investigation is              
              part of a larger, coordinated University of Washington effort to               
              understand the genesis, chronology, and response to climate change             
              of Sierra Nevada alluvial fans, this project represents a unique               
              opportunity for advancement in the fields of geomorphology and                 
              Quaternary geochronology.
