Abstract    :
                   This project is to deploy a moored array of current meters                
              in the Brazil Basin of the South Atlantic as an element in the                 
              World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) process study in the                 
              deep basin (DBE).  This is an international effort with                        
              contributions from France and FRG.  A basic premise is that by                 
              carefully measuring the amount and characteristics of the inflow               
              into this basin, an understanding of the cross-density flow may                
              be obtained.  This is an important element in large scale                      
              modeling for climate purposes.
