Abstract    :
              I propose to develop a geochronometer of platinum-rick minerals                
              based on the decay of 190Pt to 186Os.  Despite the long half-life              
              (600 b.y.) and low parent isotope abundance (0.013%), I have                   
              established in preliminary work that sperrylite (PtAs2) has very               
              large Pt/ZOs ratios, and should generate easily measurable                     
              quantities of radiogenic 186Os.  I will develop a suitable                     
              chemistry for Os separation, and determine parent/daughter                     
              isotope ratios using isotope dilution/ion microprobe analysis.                 
              The half-life of 190Pt will be precisely determined using natural              
              sperrylites of well documented age.  Other Pt-rich minerals will               
              be surveyed for possible use with this decay scheme, and a                     
              variety of Pt ore deposits will be dated to test the                           
              applicability of the Pt-Os geochronometer.
