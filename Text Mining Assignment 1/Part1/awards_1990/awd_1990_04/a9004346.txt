Abstract    :
              Petri nets are widely used for modeling and analysis of concurrent             
              processing systems.  In l985, Suzuki introduced a new class of Petri           
              nets, called the temporal Petri nets, in which certain restrictions on         
              the firings of transitions are represented by formulas containing              
              temporal operators and showed that they are quite useful in specifying         
              and proving fundamental properties of concurrent systems such as               
              eventuality and fairness.  The goal of the research is to further              
              investigate the potential of temporal Petri nets and develop new               
              analysis and synthesis methods of concurrent systems based on them.
