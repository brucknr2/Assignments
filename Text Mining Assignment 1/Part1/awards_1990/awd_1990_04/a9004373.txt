Abstract    :
              Under a Small Grant for Exploratory Research, an investigation                 
              is to be carried out which explores the range of validity and                  
              underlying theoretical basis of a newly developed boundary                     
              condition for application to computational fluid dynamics. The                 
              boundary condition is for the downstream boundary of finite                    
              computing domains, which are computationally necessary for                     
              flow problems in an infinite domain.                                           
                                                                                             
              Existing specifications for this downstream boundary are                       
              unsatisfactory and require very large computing domains to                     
              avoid errors there from contaminating the simulation. A                        
              significant improvement in accuracy and computational cost                     
              would result from an improved specification of data on the                     
              downstream boundary.
