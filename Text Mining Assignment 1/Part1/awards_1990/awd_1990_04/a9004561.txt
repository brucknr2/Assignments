Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The long term aim of this project is to determine at atomic                    
              resolution the three dimensional structures of various forms                   
              of hemocyanin, an oxygen transport protein found in                            
              invertebrates, with the intent of understanding the intricacies                
              of oxygen binding by these copper-containing proteins.  The                    
              specific objectives are: (1) the determination of the crystal                  
              structure of the oxygenated and deoxygenated forms of subunit II               
              of Limulus polyphemus hemocyanin; (2) Comparison of the oxy and                
              deoxy structures, based on data from a single crystal if necessary,            
              for the elucidation of the active site geometry, including the                 
              orientation of the molecular oxygen with respect to the two                    
              copper centers and protein ligands; and (3) The crystallization                
              of other interesting hemocyanins, such as subunit IIIa, another                
              subunit of Limulus hemocyanin with an active site chemistry                    
              much more like a typical molluscan than arthropodan hemocyanin,                
              the whole molecules of Limulus hemocyanin and hybrid and                       
              cooperative Limulus hexamers in forms suitable for x-ray                       
              diffraction analysis.
