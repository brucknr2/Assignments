Abstract    :
                   The two priority goals of this project are (1) to extend                  
              magnetic domain calculations with emphasis on incorporating effects            
              from micro- and macrostress and (2) to develop micromagnetic theory            
              at a level that will allow proper testing of models with the use               
              of experimental data such as bulk coercivity and isothermal                    
              remanent magnetization.
