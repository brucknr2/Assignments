Abstract    :
              While considerable progress has been made in the past three years              
              on the static typechecking of object-oriented languages, object-               
              oriented databases pose additional problems.  In particular we                 
              need to clarify the relationship between type and extent.  The                 
              relationship EMPLOYEE < PERSON as a relationship between classes               
              or types says something about the inheritance of methods, while                
              in a database context it also means set inclusion.  There is an                
              apparent contradiction: how can a set of one type be a subset of               
              a set of some other type?  The use of "partially dynamic" types                
              is investigated in order to resolve this issue, which will allow               
              us to deal with heterogeneous collections in a statically typed                
              system.  The rules for type checking for heterogeneous                         
              collections appear to be closely related to those already                      
              developed for manipulating relational databases.  If this is the               
              case, then type inference should also be possible. Research plan               
              includes development of a prototype language that demonstrates                 
              the feasibility of these ideas.
