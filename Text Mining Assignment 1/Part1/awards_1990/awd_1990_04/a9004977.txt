Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Research indicates that calcium ions and signal-modulated ion                  
              channels may play a central role in plant cellular signal                      
              transduction.  Guard cells provide an ideal system for the study               
              of plant signaling, as these cells respond dynamically to hormone              
              and light stimuli in regulating gas exchange.  Recent data                     
              suggest that calcium regulation of ion channels in the plasma                  
              membrane of guard clls provides a basis for physiologically-                   
              observed calcium dependent stomatal movements.  Preliminary                    
              results show that abscisic acid induces increases in cytosolic                 
              calcium, which in turn may trigger stomatal closing, thus                      
              protecting plants from desiccation.  The goals of the proposed                 
              research are to achieve an accurate understanding of the                       
              molecular mechanisms by which cytosolic calcium and other ions                 
              regulate inward rectifying potassium channels and by which                     
              mechanisms abscisic acid exerts control over these processes.                  
              Isolated guard cells will be studied by simultaneous patch clamp               
              analysis and photometric measurements of cytosolic calcium,                    
              allowing the direct investigation of effects of cytosolic and                  
              extracellular modulators on signaling events.                                  
                                                                                             
              The knowledge gained from these studies will contribute                        
              substantially to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms                 
              controlling gas and water exchange in the leaves of plants and                 
              will provide a quantitative description of biophysical and                     
              biochemical regulation of ion channels in higher plant cells.
