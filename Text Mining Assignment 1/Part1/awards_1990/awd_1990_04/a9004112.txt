Abstract    :
                This research is to determine the velocity structure at points               
              along the TACT (Trans-Alaska Crustal Transect) reflection/                     
              refraction profile, using the technique of time domain inversion               
              of teleseismic receiver functions.  The first stage will be to                 
              use existing data from DWWSSN station COL to determine the                     
              velocity structure beneath the Fairbanks area, which lies in the               
              Tanana-Yukon terrane and near the transect line.  The next stage               
              will be to establish at least 5 seismic stations along the TACT                
              line between Fairbanks and Valdez, Alaska.  These stations, which              
              will utilize State of Alaska microwave facilities, will collect                
              teleseismic data through the winter of 1990-91 (6-7 months) which              
              can then be inverted for the velocity structure beneath the                    
              individual stations.
