Abstract    :
                This research is to carry out tree-ring studies that have been               
              proven to yield information, absolute year dates and zones of                  
              rupture, for prehistoric earthquakes.  The testing does not                    
              damage the trees.  Paleoseismology is essential for establishing               
              a long enough record of earthquakes to enable estimation of                    
              probabilities for future major earthquakes.  The immediate future              
              is likely to be similar to the most recent past.  Coastal redwood              
              trees or well-preserved stumps exist along several faults in                   
              northern California and some ages extend back over 600 years.                  
              The research will concentrate on two main project areas, the San               
              Andreas fault north of San Francisco and the Little Salmon Creek               
              fault zone at the southern end of the Cascadia Subduction Zone.                
              This research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard                 
              Reduction Program.
