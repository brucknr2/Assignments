Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The overall goals of this research are to improve the application              
              of spin trapping to phagocyte cells and to better understand the               
              free radical biology of phagocytic cells.  Using the spin trap 4-              
              POBN, the investigators have demonstrated that 1-3% of oxygen                  
              radical formed can be trapped as hydroxyl radical in a                         
              myloperoxidase-mediated reaction.  These results will likely                   
              resolve a conflicting body of literature.  The next aim will be to             
              complete work with 4-POBN.  A second goal is to clarify the                    
              localization of spin trapping agents.  This will be determined by              
              using fluorescent spin trapping probes with confocal microscopy.               
              Finally, during the course of the coming year, studies of the role             
              of lactoferrin in hydroxyl radical formation will be completed.                
                                                                                             
              This research will continue development of techniques for the                  
              application of spin trapping to the study of biological systems and            
              will contribute to understanding of free radical events within                 
              phagocytic cells.
