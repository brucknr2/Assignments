Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The proposed research concerns a number of experimental                        
              approaches designed to address the question of how the primary                 
              sequence of a protein influences spontaneous folding and                       
              stability.  The investigations will initially involve variants                 
              of a protein, bacteriophage lysozyme.  Two other bacteriophage                 
              proteins will eventually replace the lysozyme as the paradigm                  
              of protein folding.  Several single- and multiple-site mutants                 
              of bacteriophage lysozyme will be selected from a group of                     
              existing variants and will be employed in studies of their                     
              thermodynamic stability.  The types of mutants which will be                   
              used include those which, compared to the wild type protein,                   
              exhibit altered:  (1) sensitivity to thermal inactivation, (2)                 
              numbers of charged residues, and (3) cysteine residues capable                 
              of forming disulfide bridges.  An attempt will be made to                      
              experimentally determine electrostatic contributions to protein                
              stability as a function of sequence.  Proteins containing                      
              genetically-engineered disulfide bridges will be studied to                    
              determine the nature of the stability change introduced and                    
              also to obtain the free energy of bridge formation for each as                 
              a function of pH and temperature.  From the latter and the free                
              energy of denaturation of the bridged and un-bridged proteins,                 
              a thermodynamic cycle will be constructed.  This will permit                   
              independent determination of how the free energy of the native                 
              and the denatured states are modified.
