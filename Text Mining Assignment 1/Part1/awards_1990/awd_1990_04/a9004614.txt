Abstract    :
                   The measurement of natural 222Rn and deliberately introduced SF6          
              can be used to accurately detect and quantify groundwater delivery             
              to stream flow.  Experiments, involving the simultaneous                       
              measurement of 222RN and SF6 will be conducted in the Santa Fe River           
              in Florida.  The detection of anomalously high levels of 222Rn in the          
              stream will permit the identification of locations of groundwater              
              input.  The observed variations between SF6 and 222Rn will be used to          
              determine accurate gas exchange rates, which are needed to estimate            
              the groundwater component of surface discharge.  The rate of gas               
              exchange, which can be expressed as a reaeration coefficient, is               
              also a determining factor in assessing water quality in a stream.              
              Thus, the measurement of 222Rn and SF6 together will yield another             
              geochemical technique for assessing the water quality of aquatic               
              systems.                                                                       
                   Measurements of the D/H and 180/160 ratios in water samples               
              collected from the Sante Fe during a 222Rn survey following a major            
              precipitation event when the difference between the precipitation              
              derived surface runoff and the well integrated groundwater                     
              component is maximized will provide an independent check on                    
              estimates of groundwater delivery based on the 222Rn data.                     
                   The proposed research will benefit hydrologists and water                 
              resource managers by establishing a powerful new geochemical                   
              technique for examining the interconnections between groundwater               
              and surface flow.  In addition, the research will provide a                    
              hydrologic and water quality data base not easily obtained by                  
              conventional methods.
