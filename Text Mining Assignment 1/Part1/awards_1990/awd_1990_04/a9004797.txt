Abstract    :
                   This award provides one-third of the funding needed to                    
              acquire a thermal ionization mass spectrometer that will be                    
              installed and operated in the Department of Earth and Planetary                
              Sciences at Washington University in St. Louis. Washington                     
              University is committed to providing the remaining funds needed.               
                   Acquisition of a mass spectrometer will allow terrestrial                 
              isotopic and geochronological studies to be conducted by the                   
              Principal Investigator and colleagues in the Earth and Planetary               
              Sciences Department. Primary applications will be (1) uranium-                 
              lead zircon dating and neodymium and lead isotopic studies of                  
              orogenic belts such as the Archean Slave Province, the                         
              Proterozoic Wopmay Orogen, and the Proterozoic of the                          
              southwestern U.S., (2) Isotopic studies of continental rift                    
              magmatism in Baikal(USSR) and Rio Grande (US) rifts.
