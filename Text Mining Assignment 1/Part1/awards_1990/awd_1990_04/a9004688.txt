Abstract    :
                   The PI will establish experimentally in both crystalline and              
              clastic rocks quantitative relations between in situ stress                    
              magnitudes and breakout characteristics (such as location, span,               
              depth, persistence) under realistic simulation of field conditions.            
              He will also study the mechanism of breakout formation and growth              
              in common crystalline rock such as granite and basalt, and compare             
              it to the failure process observed in clastic sedimentary rock, and            
              produce analytical model(s) of the breakout-stress relations,                  
              calibrated by experimental results.
