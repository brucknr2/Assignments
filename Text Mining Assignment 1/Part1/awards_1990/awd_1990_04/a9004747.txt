Abstract    :
              This study addresses the role of mafic and intermediate-                       
              composition magmas in the genesis of rhyolites at the Tomochic                 
              volcanic center (TVC), where the stratigraphic section is the                  
              most complete and where the history of volcanism is best                       
              documented among known eruptive centers in the Sierra Madre                    
              Occidental.  Recent field and chronologic work at the TVC has                  
              indicated that two distinct lithologies, porphyritic two-pyroxene              
              andesite and crystal-poor basaltic andesite, were important                    
              components of the magma systems that fed large-volume rhyolite                 
              ash-flow eruptions.  A genetic relationship between these                      
              lithologies and the rhyolites is allowed, but is poorly                        
              constrained, by available data.  The principal goal of this study              
              will be to evaluate that relationship further, via:                            
              (a)comparison and modeling of mineralogic, isotopic (Sr, Nd), and              
              geochemical variations among all rock types, and                               
              (b) petrologic study of hybrid post-collapse lavas, to                         
              characterize the deep, mafic parts of the reservoir beneath the                
              Las Varas caldera, for comparison with extruded basaltic                       
              andesite.                                                                      
              Results will constrain model pertaining to the genesis of                      
              rhyolites, and of associated, more mafic magmas, in what is                    
              considered the world's largest "rhyolite-dominated"volcanic                    
              field.  Results will also be important to models linking style of              
              volcanism with tectonic regime, and to our understanding of                    
              processes associated with the evolution of large-volume                        
              subcaldera reservoirs.
