Abstract    :
              This project entails two studies on the effects of the recent                  
              Hurrican Hugo on the sediment geology and the ecology of reef                  
              systems in the U.S. Virgin Islands.  This project is being                     
              facilitated by the Foundations rapid response mechanism.  The                  
              maultiple thrusts of the work are: (1)- characterization of the                
              sediment export and sedimentation rates at two sites that have a               
              record of pre-hurricane conditions; (2)- documentation and                     
              quantifiucation of the reef community changes in four coral reef               
              regions including that at Buck Island National Monument; (3)-                  
              documentation and quantification of changes in back reef                       
              (seagrass, mangrove) systems; (4)- investigatation of how the                  
              hurricane has disrupted the guilds of reef herbivores and the                  
              consequences of these perturbations; and (5)- investigatation of               
              the disruption in nutrient fluxes and dynamics in back reef                    
              habitats.
