Abstract    :
                   Southwestern Utah has an essentially complete Cenomanian-                 
              Turonian stratigraphic record of the transgressive-regressive                  
              cycle along the western margin of the Greenhorn Sea which also                 
              records the early history of the Sevier orogenic foreland basin.               
              This project will develop lithostratigraphic, biostratigraphic,                
              and radiometric means of correlation across the entire sequence.               
              As the marine part of the cycle has already been studied in some               
              detail and correlated regionally, research will concentrate on                 
              marginal marine and terrestrial deposits and faunas.  Correlation              
              of these strata is critical for interpretation of the evolution                
              of the Sevier orogenic foreland basin.  Detailed measured                      
              sections will be taken and brackish water faunas and terrestrial               
              faunas will be examined throughout the sequence.  Radiometric                  
              dates will be employed to constrain and test correlations.  This               
              record of marginal marine and terrestrial taxa will be the most                
              extensive of this age in the world and will allow for evaluation               
              of extinction and evolutionary patterns of marine through                      
              terrestrial communities during a single transgressvie-regressive               
              marine cycle.
