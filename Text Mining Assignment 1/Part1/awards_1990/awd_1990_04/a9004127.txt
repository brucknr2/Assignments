Abstract    :
              Massively parallel architectures have been proposed for large scale            
              problems in associative processing, database management, artificial            
              intelligence, image processing, etc.  In a very large machine the              
              cost of the PE interconnections is significant.  The perfect                   
              shuffle and exchange connections are an attractive alternative to              
              other connection schemes such as two-dimensional meshes, multi-                
              stage networks and hypercubes.  This project studies a massively               
              parallel architecture where the processing elements are                        
              interconnected with perfect shuffle and exchange networks.  Issues             
              being investigated include how to best divide a machine into                   
              modules, how to add redundancy, how to control data routing, the               
              architecture of each processing element and how to control each                
              processing element.
