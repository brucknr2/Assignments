Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Dr. Becker's laboratory is interested in the regulation of                     
              nuclear genes encoding enzymes that are involved in the process                
              of photorespiration and localized in leaf peroxisomes. The                     
              expression of these genes is organ specific, developmentally                   
              regulated, and strongly modulated by light, as studied in                      
              emerging cucumber seedlings. He has recently isolated cDNA and                 
              genomic clones for two photorespiratory enzymes, hydroxypyruvate               
              reductase (HPR) and serine:glyoxylate aminotransferase (SGAT),                 
              and have sequenced an HPR clone containing the entire coding                   
              region plus 2.2kb of 5' flanking sequence. Here, he proposes to                
              confirm (by nuclear run-on studies) the transcriptional                        
              regulation suggested by prior mRNA assays and transcript                       
              analyses. He then intends to use the isolated clones to assay for              
              cis acting regulatory elements (be deletion analysis in                        
              transgenic tobacco), trans acting factors (by gel shift and foot               
              printing assays), and possible changes in chromatin structure                  
              accompanying both developmental and light regulation.                          
              %%%                                                                            
              The process of photorespiration is linked to but independent of                
              photosynthesis. The function of photorespiration for the plant is              
              to return to the Calvin cycle three out of every four carbon                   
              atoms diverted from it by the oxygenase activity of the carbon                 
              dioxide fixing enzyme of the photosynthetic cycle. This is of                  
              major metabolic importance to the plant. The regulation of the                 
              enzymes of that pathway are the topic of the current study.
