Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Dolichos biflorus plant contains a family of lectin genes, some            
              of which are differentially expressed, both spatially and                      
              temporally.  This laboratory has shown that the genes for two of               
              these lectins, the seed lectin and DB58, are highly homologous and             
              have limited differences in their flanking regions.  In the                    
              proposed continuation of this work, the tissue specific regulation             
              and developmental expression of these two genes will be examined.              
              Initial studies will focus on transgenic analyses of cis elements              
              of these genes.  Transgenic studies coupled with site directed                 
              mutagenesis will also be employed in an effort to identify the                 
              signals by which these two lectins are targeted to their different             
              subcellular destinations.                                                      
                                                                                             
              Basic information gained in this research should contribute to the             
              eventual elucidation of the physiological role of plant lectins and            
              to our understanding of the regulation of expression and                       
              intracellular targeting of lectins and other plant proteins.
