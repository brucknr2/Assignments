Abstract    :
              This research involves the study of the stability of crystal                   
              surfaces to defect formation (i.e. steps, vacancies etc.) by                   
              employing high q-resolution low energy electron diffraction.  The              
              surface roughening of the (110) face of palladium, copper,                     
              cobalt, and rhodium will be investigated.  This study has two                  
              objectives:  1) to determine if an instability in the surface                  
              inter-atomic potential, preceeding roughening, is a general                    
              phenomenon; 2) to determine how the electronic structure of the                
              metals determine the roughening temperature of the (110) face                  
              relative to the melting temperature Tm.  This work provides a                  
              benchmark test for models of the energetics of these surfaces                  
              near Tm and relates to new theoretical calculations of surface                 
              defect formation energies.  In addition to the (110) face studies              
              the high temperature structure of nickel(001) will also be                     
              studied.
