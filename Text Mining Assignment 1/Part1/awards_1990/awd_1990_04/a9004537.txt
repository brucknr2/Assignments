Abstract    :
              Our goal is to understand the mechanisms by which the                          
              expression of the maize anthocyanin biosynthetic enzymes is                    
              coordinately induced by the regulatory protein B.  The B gene                  
              product is required for the steady state accumulation of mRNA                  
              from several genes encoding anthocyanin biosynthetic enzymes                   
              (structural genes), and we have recently demonstrated that the                 
              B gene plays a major role in stimulating the transcription of                  
              the structural genes.  Transient cotransformation studies using                
              plasmids carrying structural gene promoter sequences fused to                  
              luciferase, and plasmids which produce B protein, demonstrate                  
              B mediates an approximately 100 fold induction in luciferase                   
              activity.  The deduced amino acid sequence of the B protein                    
              (obtained from the cDNA sequence) revealed a myc homologous                    
              region found in several DNA binding proteins and a negatively                  
              charged region characteristic of transcriptional activators.                   
              Both in vitro and in vivo assays will be used to: examine the                  
              in vivo modification of the B protein and its subcellular                      
              location and tissue distribution; dissect the regions of the                   
              B protein necessary for transcriptional control of the                         
              structural genes; determine the functions of these regions                     
              (transcriptional activation, DNA binding, protein/protein                      
              interactions, etc.); assess whether the B protein interacts                    
              directly with regulatory regions found in the structural genes;                
              identify other proteins interacting with B; and investigate if                 
              B influences anthocyanin biosynthesis at levels in addition to                 
              transcription of the structural genes.  The maize anthocyanin                  
              biosynthetic pathway represents one of a small number of                       
              pathways in higher plants for which regulatory proteins and                    
              their targets are known.  Thus, studying the mechanisms                        
              utilized by B should reveal important information regarding                    
              regulated gene expression in higher plants.
