Abstract    :
                   Covert channels are channels not intended for information                 
              transfer. A subliminal channel allows one to hide a secret message             
              inside an authenticator. An abuse enables a participant to us a                
              cryptosystem for a different purpose than intended. In this                    
              project, techniques guaranteeing that such abuses are impossible               
              are being studied. The main open problems addressed are: (1) can               
              unconditionally secure authentication schemes be made subliminal-              
              free, and generally, which systems can be made abuse-free; (2)which            
              non-trivial systems can be made abuse-free when using only a                   
              passive warden; (3) can the results be extended to analog and                  
              digital covert channels?
