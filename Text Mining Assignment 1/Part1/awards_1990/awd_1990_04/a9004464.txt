Abstract    :
              The research will focus on using a state transition formalism                  
              that is mathematically rigorous, yet easily accessible to the                  
              average engineer for the analysis and synthesis of network                     
              protocols.  Building on past work in which the principal                       
              investigator has developed rudiments of a theory for                           
              communication network protocols, this research will develop a                  
              broad theoretical foundation, investigate sound and efficient                  
              methods for protocol analysis and synthesis, and apply these                   
              methods to the design of protocols.                                            
                   The analysis of protocols will address two kinds of                       
              concerns: logical properties and quantitative performance.                     
              Logical properties have to do with the functional requirements of              
              a protocol and are determined by the reachable states and                      
              "allowed behaviors" of the protocol.  The concerns formalized as               
              logical properties include safety, progress, and real-time                     
              progress.                                                                      
                   Concerns that still need to be formalized included secrecy,               
              authenticity, anonymity, privacy, and accessibility. Quantitative              
              performance has to do with the throughput and response time                    
              characteristics of a protocol.  Quantitative measures such as                  
              probability distributions or time bounds will be introduced into               
              the state transition formalism.                                                
                   In addition, the research will include the development of                 
              methods for protocol construction by refinement and composition                
              techniques for deriving protocol converters and adapters, as well              
              as for maintaining and modifying network protocols in a changing               
              environment.
