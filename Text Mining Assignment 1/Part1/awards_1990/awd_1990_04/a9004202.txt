Abstract    :
                   Michael Falk will continue his research into the interplay                
              of combinatorics and algebra with the topology of the complement               
              of an arrangement of hyperplanes over the field of complex                     
              numbers.  The emphasis will be on two related problems:  the                   
              classification problem, and the K(pi,1) problem.  The                          
              classification centers on the following question and its                       
              converse:  is the topology of the complement of an arrangement                 
              determined by the intersection pattern of the original                         
              hyperplanes?  The K(pi,1) problem asks for necessary and/or                    
              sufficient conditions for the vanishing of certain topological                 
              obstructions in the complement.                                                
                   This simple object, the complement of a collection of (n-1)-              
              dimensional linear subspaces in n-dimensional space, displays a                
              surprisingly rich structure.  The variety of methods which have                
              been found useful for analyzing it come from combinatorics,                    
              differential equations, and K-theory.
