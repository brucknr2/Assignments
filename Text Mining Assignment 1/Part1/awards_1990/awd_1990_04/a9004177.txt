Abstract    :
                This research is to study the crust and upper mantle beneath                 
              central California using a new and independent teleseismic data                
              set collected in the region by Pacific Gas and Electric Co.                    
              First, the receiver function technique will be used to study the               
              orientation and possible imbrication of the oceanic crust beneath              
              the continental margin in addition to looking for variations in                
              crustal thickness along the margin.  Second, the data set will be              
              merged with that of the USGS to do a 3-D seismic travel time                   
              residual study of the crust and mantle beneath the margin.                     
              Understanding the tectonic history is essential for better                     
              understanding and characterization of the potential seismic                    
              hazards present today.  This research is a component of the                    
              National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
