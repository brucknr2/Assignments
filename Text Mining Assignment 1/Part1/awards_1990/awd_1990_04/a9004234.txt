Abstract    :
                   A field study will be undertaken to investigate the biogenic              
              emission-fate of monoterpenes in a southern pine forest.   The                 
              research plan includes measurement of monoterpenes emission                    
              rates, characterization of atmospheric dispersion at the forest                
              site, and monitoring atmospheric oxidation products of the                     
              monoterpenes.  The field study will be conducted in conjunction                
              with NOAA and NCAR where these groups will provide support in                  
              terms of trace gas measurements.
