Abstract    :
                This research is to fund the U.S. portion of a joint U.S.-                   
              Icelandic wide-angle reflection/refraction experiment in the area              
              of the South Iceland overlapping spreading centers.  Field                     
              expenses will come from the Icelandic NSF.  The experiment is                  
              designed to answer three questions: 1) Is the Eastern Volcanic                 
              Zone a propagating spreading center and what is its propagation                
              speed? 2) Is there any subsurface evidence that the South Iceland              
              Seismic Zone is a developed transform fracture zone at depth,                  
              3) Does the Icelandic rift zone have crustal magma chambers or is              
              it like the rest of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, without any                        
              significant crustal low velocity zones?  This research is a                    
              component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
