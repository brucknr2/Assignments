Abstract    :
                   There are two competing models for the mesozoic tectonic                  
              history of southern California - closure of a marginal basin                   
              between North America and  an outboard continental fragment and                
              normal oceanic subduction under North America.  The Pelona-                    
              Orocopia-Rand-Portal Ridge schists and the Vincent-Chocolate                   
              Mountains-Orocopia- Rand thrust faults are products of this                    
              tectonic episode.  This study will attempt to resolve this issue               
              by close examination of the thrust fault in the Gavilan Hills                  
              where the clear-cut northeast vergence forms the main argument                 
              for the marginal basin model.  The work will test the possibility              
              that the northeast motion is due to a younger normal fault which               
              re-activated the original thrust.  Results are applicable to the               
              resolution of Mesozoic tectonics in the southwestern United                    
              States.
