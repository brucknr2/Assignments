Abstract    :
                   This project covers a wide range of topics in algebraic and               
              geometric topology.  More specifically, the researchers study the              
              following:  (a) Combinatorial and geometric properties of various              
              classes of discrete groups, including finitely presented infinite              
              simple groups, groups presented by a rewriting system, groups                  
              presented by a triangle of groups, and the automorphism group of               
              a free or free-by-finite group; (b) laminations in 3-manifolds;                
              (c) equivariant and controlled topology, including the                         
              equivariant topology of locally linearizable actions and the                   
              topological equivalence of linear representations.                             
                   Topology addresses geometric properties which do not depend               
              in an essential way on distances or angles.  It nevertheless                   
              attempts to find ways to compare topological objects and to                    
              reduce their study to computations in many cases.  The instant                 
              project is engaged in different aspects of this multifarious                   
              effort.
