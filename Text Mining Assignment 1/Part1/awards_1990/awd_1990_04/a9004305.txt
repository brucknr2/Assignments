Abstract    :
                   This award provides one-half the funds required to purchase               
              a cathodoluminescence (CL) spectrometer system that will be                    
              housed and operated in the Department of Geology at St. Lawrence               
              University. The University is committed to providing the                       
              remaining funds.                                                               
                   The cathodoluminescent properties of minerals (the ability                
              to emit visible light when bombarded with electrons) depends on a              
              variety of factors such a crystalline defects and chemical                     
              impurities. For the mineral quartz, it is found that its CL                    
              spectra can be used to fingerprint quartz grains from different                
              source rocks. Hence, the CL spectra of quartz grains in                        
              sedimentary rocks holds promise as a tool for reconstructing the               
              provenance of sediments in ancient sedimentary basins. The                     
              equipment purchased with this award will be used by the PI to                  
              further investigate the applicability of CL in such studies.
