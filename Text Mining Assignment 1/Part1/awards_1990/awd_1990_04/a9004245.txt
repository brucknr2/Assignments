Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Previous research in this laboratory has shown that the fish gill, like        
              the mammalian lung, has the unique ability to regulate the                     
              concentration of a variety of hormones in blood through specific               
              activation and inactivation processes.  All blood pumped by the fish           
              heart must first pass through the gills before it is distributed to the        
              rest of the body.  Thus the gill is in an ideal location to effectively        
              serve as a biological blood filter, and indeed, the PI has shown that          
              the efficiency of hormone metabolism by the gill may exceed 90%.  The          
              proposed research will examine the mechanisms through which the gill           
              metabolizes several important blood pressure regulating hormones,              
              catecholamines, angiotensin and atrial natriuretic peptide.                    
              Preliminary studies have also shown that these same mechanisms may be          
              involved in degradation of toxic substances and these studies will be          
              continued.  This project is significant for several reasons: 1.                
              Information derived from these studies will further our understanding          
              of endocrine control systems in lower vertebrates.  2. Due to the              
              similarity between gills and lungs the present work will provide               
              insight into the evolution of the lung as a metabolic organ and the            
              mechanisms of pulmonary metabolism.  These studies also illustrate the         
              potential of the gill as an alternative, non-mammalian model in                
              biomedical research.  3. Evaluation of the gill as an organ for                
              detoxification has not been critically examined.  Our preliminary work         
              indicates that the gill may also be an important tool in environmental         
              studies.
