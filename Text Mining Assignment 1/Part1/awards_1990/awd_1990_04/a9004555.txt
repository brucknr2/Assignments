Abstract    :
                This research is to study the large-scale aspherical and                     
              spherically averaged structure of the earth from long-period                   
              seismic data.  The variety of three-dimensional earth models in                
              the literature and their general inability to provide detailed                 
              fits to the data indicate where work is needed.  Two areas will                
              be emphasized:  the expansion and interpretation of a dataset of               
              PIP and PKIKP equivalent modes, some of which are very                         
              anomalously split, and the detailed spectral analysis of long-                 
              period surface wave packets which should provide extremely good                
              lateral resolution of upper mantle structure.  The goal is to                  
              combine this information with datasets of structure coefficients               
              and long-period travel times to constrain global models of                     
              aspherical structure.
