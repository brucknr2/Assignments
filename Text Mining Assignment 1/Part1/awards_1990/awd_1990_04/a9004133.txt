Abstract    :
              A recently published isotopic study of the precaldera rhyolites                
              of Glass Mountain, Long Valley, has shown that the timing of                   
              differentiation of rhyolitic magma can be determined from Rb-Sr                
              dating and resolved from the age of eruption (as determined by K-              
              Ar ages).  Furthermore, the differences are difficult to explain               
              unless the rhyolitic magmas persisted in the upper reaches of the              
              chamber in stable, stratified zones for long periods, of the                   
              order of 105 to 106 years, with negligible mass transfer between               
              the different layers.  Such protracted residence periods are                   
              considerably in excess of the estimates implied by recently                    
              published thermal modelling of the longevity of high-level                     
              silicic magma chambers.  This project is to extend this research               
              to a comprehensive study of the mineral-glass Rb-Sr systematics                
              and 40Ar-39Ar ages of the Glass mountain rhyolites and to develop              
              similar research on other young silicic systems.  The additional               
              volcanic centers which have been selected are Coso (California),               
              Mineral Mountains, Twin Peaks and Honeycomb Hills (Utah), La                   
              Primavera (Mexican Volcanic Belt) and Naivasha (Kenya).  These                 
              particular volcanic centers were chosen because they contain                   
              pristine rhyolitic glasses ranging in composition from                         
              metaluminous to highly peralkaline with high Rb/Sr ratios, and                 
              have already been well characterized in terms of field relations,              
              age, chemistry and petrography.
