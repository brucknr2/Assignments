Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research of Professor Louis Billera               
              of Cornell University. Dr. Billera's proposed work is in the                   
              areas of convex polytopes and multivariate splines, and will                   
              involve the use of algebraic and combinatorial methods to attack               
              fundamental questions in each of these areas.                                  
                   Professor Billera's work is unusually interdisciplinary                   
              within mathematics, with roots in the applied field of spline                  
              functions as well as in the most abstract parts of commutative                 
              and homological algebra, algebraic geometry, and combinatorics. A              
              spline is a thin strip of metal or wood that one may grasp at                  
              both ends and manipulate to form a smooth curve that not only                  
              passes through two points (the places where it is held), but does              
              so in a given direction at each point. The spline functions of                 
              concern to Professor Billera generally describe smooth shapes of               
              dimension greater than one, and with a smoother junction at the                
              edges than can be gotten, in the case of physical splines, by                  
              holding the two strips together in the hand. They are of interest              
              not only within mathematics, but in design, especially of                      
              automobiles and airplanes, and in solving problems in computer                 
              graphics.
