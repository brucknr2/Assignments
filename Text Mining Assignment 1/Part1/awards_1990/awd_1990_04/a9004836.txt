Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The principal investigator will continue his study of the                 
              geometry of the Yang-Mills moduli space.  This will include an                 
              analysis of the semiclassical measure on moduli space with                     
              fermions added, and Donaldson invariants in terms of differential              
              forms.  He will also investigate a general approach to                         
              establishing the existence of non-minimal Yang-Mills fields on 4-              
              manifolds with symmetry.                                                       
                   In the early 1980s S.K.Donaldson showed the intimate                      
              connection between solutions of the Yang-Mills equations and                   
              differentiable structures on four-dimensional space.  This                     
              discovery meant that two four-dimensional space-times could be                 
              topologically the same (have the same shape) but be                            
              differentiably distinct.  No experiments have been devised to                  
              discover which of these differentiable structures describes our                
              space-time.  The principal investigator will continue his                      
              analysis of the ramifications of Donaldson's discoveries.
