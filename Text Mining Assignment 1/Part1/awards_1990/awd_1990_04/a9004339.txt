Abstract    :
                   The Mojave desert between the San Andreas and the Garlock                 
              fault zones occupies a key position in Southwestern U.S.                       
              tectonics.  Recent results indicate that a previously                          
              unrecognized region of early Miocene-age rifting is present which              
              has led to the discovery of Mesozoic tectonometamorphic events as              
              well as to an improved understanding of present strike-slip                    
              faulting in the region and its role in accommodating Pacific-                  
              North American plate motion.  This renewal will focus on the                   
              structure, timing relations, shear zone petrology and uplift                   
              history of the extensional complex, and will document the                      
              depositional history of syn-and post-tectonic sedimentary rocks                
              in basins adjacent to the core complex.  The timing and                        
              conditions of formation of the Mesozoic high-grade metamorphic                 
              rocks exhumed by Miocene detachments will also be addressed.                   
              Results will be applied to the Mesozoic and Cenozoic tectonic and              
              paleogeographic evolution of the western United States.
