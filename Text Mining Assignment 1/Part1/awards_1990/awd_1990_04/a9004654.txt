Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Hurricane Hugo devastated beachfront communities from                          
              Charleston to Myrtle Beach destroying hundreds of shorefront                   
              structures.  Reconstruction has already begun under the 1988                   
              Beachfront Management Act and Hugo has provided an early test                  
              for some of the buildings which were located in this dead zone                 
              but were destroyed by the hurricane beyond repair will be                      
              tested.  The study will follow and analyze the decisionmaking                  
              process and the implementation of the retreat from the                         
              shoreline policy at the private and public, local, state and                   
              federal levels.  The evaluation of the effectiveness and                       
              viability of these rebuilding restrictions will be of benefit                  
              to researchers, administrators, insurers and other                             
              professionals interested in decreasing the vulnerability of                    
              people and property located in the coastal areas of the United                 
              States.
