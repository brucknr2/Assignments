Abstract    :
                   Sequence stratigraphic studies of the Alabama Tertiary have               
              resulted in the delineation of approximately twenty depositional               
              sequences, which are interpreted to reflect distinct eustatic                  
              sea-level cycles of varying magnitude.  The PI recently completed              
              detailed studies of two of these sequences.  Significant                       
              variations in degree of bioturbation, general ichnofabrics, and                
              discrete trace fossils are observed within and between component               
              systems tracts, and reflect changes in substrate consistency,                  
              physical environmental energy, sedimentation rate, and bottom-                 
              and/or pore-water chemistry that are consistent with both the                  
              phase and magnitude of the associated eustatic cycles.  These                  
              results demonstrate the potential of extended trace fossil                     
              studies in the context of sequence stratigraphy.                               
                   In order to more fully assess this potential, detailed                    
              studies of strata representative of all of the twenty                          
              depositional sequences delineated in the Alabama Tertiary are                  
              proposed.  The objectives of these analyses are: 1) to further                 
              assess the response of trace-fossil assemblages to predicted sea-              
              level-mediated paleoenvironmental changes; and 2) to evaluate the              
              ichnological variability that exists between and within systems                
              tracts as a function of differences in depositional environment,               
              lithofacies, and phase and magnitude of associated eustatic                    
              cycles.                                                                        
                   This research will 1) provide an independent test of                      
              sequence stratigraphic concepts and interpreted sea-level                      
              histories, 2) establish an improved set of ichnological criteria               
              that can be incorporated into models useful for recognizing the                
              eustacy signal, and 3) improve our overall understanding of trace              
              fossils as paleoenvironmental indicators.
