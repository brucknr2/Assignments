Abstract    :
                   There are two areas which will be addressed in this                       
              research. In the first, problems will be considered which are                  
              related to a conjecture by Lech concerning the behavior of the                 
              Hilbert function under faithfully flat morphisms of local                      
              noetherian rings. In the second, the principal investigator                    
              will study stability properties of the divisor class group                     
              CL(R) where R is a local normal excellent henselian ring.                      
                   This research is concerned with the geometric properties                  
              of commutative rings which arise in algebraic geometry. One of                 
              the problems to be considered is a conjecture by Lech which has                
              been unsolved for twenty-five years.
