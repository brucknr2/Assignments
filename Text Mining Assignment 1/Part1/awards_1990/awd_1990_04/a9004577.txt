Abstract    :
                   This award will provide one-half of the funds required to                 
              purchase five portable Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers.              
              The GPS receivers are capable of rapid and accurate measurements               
              of distance (e.g., better than centimeter precision over base                  
              lines of 100 kilometers) and are important tools in earthquake                 
              and other crustal deformation research. The receivers will be                  
              acquired by UCLA for their research projects and are also to be                
              contributed to a pool of GPS receivers managed by the university               
              consortium group (UNAVCO), who will provide maintenance and                    
              repair for the instruments. UCLA is providing the remaining half               
              of the purchase costs.                                                         
                   The instruments will be used in research projects requiring               
              the monitoring of crustal strain related to earthquakes in the                 
              Los Angeles basin, the Parkfield-Cholame area, and the Coachella               
              valley.
