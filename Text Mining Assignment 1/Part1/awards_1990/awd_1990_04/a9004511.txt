Abstract    :
                This research is to study deformation in a highly active thrust              
              tectonic setting, the Tien Shan region in Western China.  Crustal              
              shortening across the range occurs largely by thrust faulting.                 
              The study will use classical geologic mapping of surface                       
              structures to estimate amounts of shortening across the range.                 
              Because Late Cenozoic sedimentary rocks are folded, bounds on the              
              amounts of shortening will yield bounds on the rates of                        
              deformation.  Mapping the geometry of deformed surface rocks will              
              constrain models of the subsurface shapes of the deeper faults.                
              Knowledge gained here will be applied to thrust deformation                    
              regimes in the U.S. such as the Transverse Ranges of Southern                  
              California.  This research is a component of the National                      
              Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
