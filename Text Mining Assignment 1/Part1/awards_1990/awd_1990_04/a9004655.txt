Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The principal investigator will study index problems for                  
              first-order singular operators which have specified form near                  
              singular strata.  This class of operators includes classical                   
              geometric operators with Dirac signatures and those having conic               
              type strata.  The main tool to be exploited in this investigation              
              is the "wedge calculus" and its extension to pseudomanifolds.                  
                   For most of the twentieth century operators with various                  
              types of singular sets have been the mainstay of theoretical                   
              physics.  Earliest of these was one first studied by Dirac.  This              
              operator had the property that while it was zero everywhere                    
              except at a single point, its integral, or the area under its                  
              graph, was positive.  At first such operators used by physicists               
              had no sensible mathematical explanation.  But eventually                      
              mathematicians were able to explain them by changing the context               
              of their original interpretation.  The principal investigator                  
              will analyze a large set of operators which includes Dirac's.
