Abstract    :
                   Research wil continue on the fluvial, Miocene Siwalik                     
              deposits of the Potwar Plateau in northern Pakistan.  This                     
              involves construction of detailed sedimentological logs through                
              the Chinji, Magri and Shok Pathan formations formations in                     
              several different parts of the basin where there is paleomagnetic              
              age dating.  Several important 50 to 100 m thick stratigraphic                 
              intervals in each measured sequence will be detailed                           
              sedimentologically and paleontologically over several km                       
              laterally, using photo mosaics and closely-spaced (100 m) logs.                
              Paleosol carbonates will be sampled for Carbon isotope analysis.               
              This will allow us to reconstruct the temporally and spatially                 
              varying paleoenvironments in terms of paleochannel geometry and                
              hydraulics, nature of paleosols, animal and plant activity and                 
              deposition rates.  Particular attention will be paid to: (1) the               
              upper Shok Pathan Formation (6mpBP) where there is evidence for a              
              major climatic, vegetational and faunal change and (2) the                     
              Chinji-Nagri transition (10 m.y.B.P.) where there is evidence of               
              a major faunal turnover, increasing depositional rates,                        
              increasing proportion and grain size of channel deposits, and                  
              increasing channel size, but no evidence of a climatic change.                 
              It will then be possible to understand an important period of                  
              evolution of land organisms in relation to changes in the                      
              physical and chemical environment.  This study will also have                  
              more general implications for the relationship between fluvial                 
              deposits (and the fossils they contain), tectonism and climate.
