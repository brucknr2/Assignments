Abstract    :
                   The PIs will investigate the relationships between Late                   
              Paleozoic remagnetization deformation, and diagenesis, by                      
              studying the rock magnetic properties and deformation                          
              microstructures in Paleozoic carbonates from a number of                       
              localities in eastern North America.  The principal goals will be              
              to: 1) more completely characterize the magnetic mineralogy and                
              remanence carriers in remagnetized carbonate strata; 2)                        
              investigate possible quantitative correlations between diagenetic              
              illite and diagenetic/authigenic magnetite content; 3) compare                 
              the orientations and magnitudes of magnetic and calcite twinning               
              strain fabrics; and 4) evaluate the connections between Late                   
              Paleozoic fluid migration, calcite twinning, and magnetite                     
              authigenesis, and the evolution of the Appalachian-Ouachita fold-
