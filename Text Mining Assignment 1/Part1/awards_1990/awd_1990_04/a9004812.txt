Abstract    :
              We propose to advance the Baikal project by concentrating on                   
              characterization of the 150 samples currently in hand.  No travel              
              to the USSR is planned under the aegis of 1990-91 funding.  If                 
              results of our analytical work warrant additional field studies                
              and collecting, we will formulate a new proposal based on these                
              results.                                                                       
              The SMU portion of the project will focus on obtaining K-Ar                    
              dates, and on mineral chemistry.  The new dates are essential,                 
              because we intend to evaluate the geochemical variations among                 
              lavas in a temporal-spatial framework.  We have found the Soviet               
              dates to be completely unreliable.  I will contract for                        
              approximately 20 dates on whole-rock basalt samples.  As the                   
              whole-rock geochemistry and isotopic analyses will be done at                  
              Washington University, it is appropriate that the mineral                      
              chemistry work be done at SMU.  I will perform microprobe                      
              analyses of phenocrysts, xenocrysts, and xenoliths.                            
              The budget includes funds for travel to St. Louis in order to                  
              allow us to get together after the sample characterization phase,              
              integrate our data, and arrive at interpretations of the results.              
              Dr. Sergey Rasskazov, with whom we are collaborating, has been                 
              invited to spend a month in the laboratories of Luhr and Bowring               
              during late 1990 in order to maintain project momentum and                     
              facilitate cooperation.
