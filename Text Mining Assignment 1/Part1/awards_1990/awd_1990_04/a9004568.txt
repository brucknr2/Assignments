Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The objective of the proposed research is to use a molecular                   
              genetic approach to gain an understanding of the developmental                 
              mechanisms that regulate cell expansion in tip-growing plant                   
              cells. To achieve this goal, Dr. Schiefelbein has chosen to study              
              elongation in root hairs, a relatively simple and accessible cell              
              type in plants. Mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana have been                      
              isolated that synthesize root hairs with irregular growth                      
              patterns. He will initially concentrate on two mutants (rhd3 and               
              rhd4) that, based on preliminary analyses, are likely to harbor                
              mutations in genes intimately involved in root hair elongation.                
              The specific research approaches will include: 1)                              
              characterization of the ultrastructure, microfilaments, and ion                
              currents in the wild type and mutant root hairs, 2) linkage                    
              analysis and isolation of new alleles of the RHD3 and RHD4 genes,              
              3) RFLP mapping and molecular cloning of the genes by chromosome               
              walking with a yeast artificial chromosome library, and 4)                     
              isolation and stepwise characterization of additional genes                    
              affecting root hair elongation. The results from this research                 
              are expected to provide basic information on the mechanism                     
              regulating expansion in tip-growing cells, as well as to define                
              specific genes governing root hair elongation in plants.
