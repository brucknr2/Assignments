Abstract    :
              Recent mechanically based treatments flow and erosion in bends                 
              indicate that river meandering is a highly nonlinear, autocatalytic            
              process wherein diverse, yet self-organized, meander geometries                
              arise independently of variations in flow and erodibility of                   
              valley-floor alluvium.  The nonlinearity resides in the fact that              
              the channel configuration at each instant evolves from a previous              
              channel state in accordance with mechanical conditions imposed on              
              the flow (and associated boundary stress field) by that previous               
              state.  A suitable equation of motion can be written which                     
              describes the essentials of this nonlinear behavior.  Numerical                
              simulations will be conducted to clarify how the diversity of bend             
              forms that can occur at any instant, and the tendency for certain              
              of these forms to recur over time, are compatible features of                  
              meander trains that naturally arise from the nonlinearity of the               
              process.
