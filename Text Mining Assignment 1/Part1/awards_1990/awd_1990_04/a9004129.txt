Abstract    :
              This award provides further funding for Dr. S. F. Yang, to enable              
              him to continue his research on ethylene biosynthesis.  Assisted               
              by other NSF-supported younger collaborators, Yang has                         
              demonstrated that ethylene is synthesized from methionine via S-               
              adenosylmethionine and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid.                  
              The principal objectives of the project now to be carried out by               
              Dr. Yang are (a) to purify fully and characterize 1-                           
              aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase and to determine the              
              amino acid sequence around the active site of this enzyme                      
              isolated from apples and other plant tissues, (b) to clone the                 
              gene for this enzyme from apples, (c) to characterize the                      
              inactivation of the synthase by S-adenosylmethionine in relation               
              to the enzyme's in vivo turnover, and (d) to characterize enzymes              
              involved in the so-called methionine cycle.                                    
                                                                                             
              Ethylene is a plant hormone responsible for the control of                     
              numerous aspects of plant growth and development.  This hormone                
              is commercially important in agriculture and in relation to post-              
              harvest crop physiology.  The work to be pursued here is aimed at              
              obtaining basic knowledge that can later be used as a basis for                
              manipulating the levels of ethylene in plants, either upward or                
              downward.  This is a promising approach to optimizing certain                  
              agricultural systems.  Dr. Yang's studies will provide a useful                
              theoretical basis from which ethylene production by crop plants                
              can be regulated via biotechnology.
