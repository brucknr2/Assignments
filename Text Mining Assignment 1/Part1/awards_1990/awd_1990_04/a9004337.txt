Abstract    :
              This project is concerned with mineralized porphyry systems and                
              mafic intrusions with particular emphasis on identifying                       
              "magmatic" fluids, fluid inclusions in high-grade metamorphic                  
              rocks, and fluid inclusions from ultramafic nodules, and 2) to                 
              study samples that have already been mapped and neutron-                       
              irradiated from Valles, New Mexico (dilute modern geothermal                   
              system).  Hansonburg, New Mexico (Mississippi Valley-type Pb-Zn                
              deposit), and Juneau, Alaska (gold-bearing quartz veins).  The                 
              funds will be used primarily for support of a post doc.
