Abstract    :
              The primary goal of the proposed research is to determine the                  
              relationship between the debris avalanche of Raung Volcano, Java,              
              to explosive volcanism.  The debris avalanche, with its run out                
              length of 60 kilometers is one of the largest in Indonesia and                 
              perhaps in the world.  It is well exposed and readily accessible.              
              The deposit is interstratified with deposits of magmatic                       
              eruptions, some of which are probably deposits of lateral blasts               
              similar to Mount St. Helens blast of May 18, 1980.  The central                
              question to be pursued is whether or not the debris avalanche                  
              caused an associated magmatic eruption, or a magmatic eruption                 
              caused the debris avalanche.  This issue is poorly known                       
              scientifically and is important for solving more general problems              
              about the development of pyroclastic surges and flows.  It is                  
              also critical in assessing eruption hazards and development                    
              of evacuation and contingency plans in areas of large                          
              stratovolcanoes with steeply sloping sides.
