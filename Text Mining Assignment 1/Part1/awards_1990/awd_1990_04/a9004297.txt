Abstract    :
                   This award provides approximately one-third the funding for               
              the acquisition of an inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometer             
              to be installed in the Department of Geology at Washington State               
              University. Washington State University is committed to providing              
              the remaining funds needed.                                                    
                   The instrument's analytical capabilities for trace element and            
              isotopic analysis are well-suited to the study of various rock                 
              types as well as groundwater quality problems. Housed in the                   
              Geoanalytical Laboratory at Washington State, the facility will be             
              used by a wide range of research projects in these areas of the                
              earth sciences and will serve as a regional resource for northwest             
              scientists from a number of research institutions.
