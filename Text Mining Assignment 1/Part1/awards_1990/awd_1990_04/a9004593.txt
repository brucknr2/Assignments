Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This grant is for the purchase of a cesium ion source for                      
              secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS).  The cesium ion source                 
              allows for greater than two orders of magnitude increase in                    
              sensitivity for electronegative elements such as carbon and                    
              oxygen.  The instrumentation will be used for research on                      
              heteroepitaxial thin films of compound semiconductors deposited                
              with carbon-bearing metallorganic precursors, high temperature                 
              ceramic superconductors, and ion-implanted steels.
