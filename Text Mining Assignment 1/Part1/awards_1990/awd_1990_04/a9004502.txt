Abstract    :
                   During the Miocene Epoch, 5-24 million years ago, there was               
              an extensive radiation of hominoid primates in the Eastern                     
              Hemisphere.  Their relationships with each other and with extant               
              taxa are still unclear.  Their functional anatomy and locomotor                
              adaptations are clearly different from those of extant primates.               
              This proposal seeks to characterize this radiation by descriptive              
              and functional analyses, and by defining postcranial features by               
              which Miocene taxa may be recognized as hominoids, or as                       
              primitive catarrhines.  The research will continue the PI's                    
              previous studies on Sivapithecus, Kenyapithecus, and the recently              
              discovered Simiolus, Turkanapithecus, and Afropithecus.  The                   
              study will include studies of recently collected specimens, and                
              on new specimens collected during the proposed research period.                
              Functional analyses will be made of the postcrania of all known                
              small apes from Kenya, comparisons will be made between Miocene                
              catarrhines and platyrrhines, and possible indicators of                       
              terrestriality in Miocene hominoids will be explored.
