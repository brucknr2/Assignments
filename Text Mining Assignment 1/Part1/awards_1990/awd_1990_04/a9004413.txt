Abstract    :
              This research will emphasize integration  of isotopic, chemical                
              and fluid inclusion studies, the relatively new techniques and                 
              approaches to include: (1) Sm-Nd and U-Pb dating of minerals such              
              as fluorite, cassiterite and garnet, (2) high resolution U-Pb and              
              40Ar-39Ar geochronological studies of the relationship between                 
              the cooling history of pluton, and the age and temperature of                  
              associated hydrothermal activity, (3) Rb-Sr and 40Ar-39 dating                 
              studies of fluid inclusions, and (4) multi-isotopic (Nd,Sr,Pb,O,               
              H,N,Ar,S,C) and rare earth element studies of the sources of                   
              components in individual minerals and their fluid inclusions.                  
              Two areas of classical hydrothermal mineralization in the United               
              Kingdom.  The Ns-W-As-Cu mineralization of the Cornubian                       
              metallogenic province.  The second is the MVT-related fluorite-                
              barite-base metal deposits of the North Pennine Orefield.
