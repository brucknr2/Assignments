Abstract    :
                   In the evolution of mountain belts, major episodes of                     
              tectonism are often recorded by the development of rocks of the                
              mylonite series.  The relationship of deformation and associated               
              chemical changes, at the mineral and whole rock scales, to                     
              radiometric ages is the objective of this research.  The size of               
              mineral and isotopic equilibrium domains developed during                      
              mylonitization of mafic rocks and the response of zircon and                   
              titanite will be investigated.  Results will lead to applying                  
              concepts of domainal equilibrium on measuring absolute ages of                 
              selected faults in the Southern Appalachians and their geodynamic              
              implications for the accretionary history of the Appalachian                   
              Mountain belt.
