Abstract    :
                   The mass extinction at the end of the Permian has been                    
              established as the greatest perturbation which the Earth's                     
              biosphere has experienced since the origin of metazoan life.                   
              Although relatively little is known about the cause of this mass               
              extinction, even less is known on biotic conditions in its                     
              aftermath or the nature of biotic recovery from this event.                    
              Fossil faunas and limestones in the Lower Triassic Virgin Member               
              of the Moenkopi Formation (southern Nevada and southwestern                    
              Utah), deposited 5 my after the end of the Permian, present an                 
              opportunity to learn how benthic faunas in shallow marine                      
              carbonate environments were faring in this recovery interval.                  
              Preliminary study of the Virgin limestones indicates deposition                
              in a normal marine environment with benthic macroinvertebrate                  
              assemblages of relatively low species richness.  Of potentially                
              great significance are intervals of apparent normal marine                     
              stromatolites, which may represent temporary expansion from                    
              marginal marine refugia into normal marine settings due to                     
              restriction of grazers, caused by the mass extinction.  Evidence               
              for the beginning of recovery is demonstrated through the                      
              presence of abundant specimens of the earliest articulate                      
              crinoid, which had evolved from some unknown Paleozoic inadunate               
              that survived the crisis.  Research will illuminate the way in                 
              which biotas recover from mass extinctions.
