Abstract    :
              This project will examine in detail the compositional,                         
              mineralogical, and textural changes that occur at these horizons               
              in the intrusion where a new pulse of magma has been injected.                 
              It is hoped that the data collected will provide new insights                  
              into the nature and extent of the magma mixing that occurs when a              
              new pulse of primative magma is injected into a chamber that                   
              contains a pre-existing more-evolved magma.  The date may also                 
              help to establish some minimum values for the thicknesses of                   
              crystal-liquid mush zones along the crystallization front in                   
              magma chambers, and/or provide some minimum distances for                      
              interstitial-melt migration in rapidly cooled plutonic rocks
