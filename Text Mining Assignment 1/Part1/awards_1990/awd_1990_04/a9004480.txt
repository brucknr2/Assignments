Abstract    :
                   The Pacific northwest consists of a number of exotic                      
              terranes that were accreted to the continental margin beginning                
              in the Cretaceous, however the tectonics and timing of the                     
              assembly is controversial.  This renewal of a collaborative                    
              project will address the mechanics and processes of mid-                       
              Cretaceous Orogeny in the southeast Coast Plutonic Complex of                  
              British Columbia and its extension in the Crystalline Core of the              
              North Cascades of Washington.  Models of orogenesis to be tested               
              include bulk shortening, transpressive thrusting, contractional                
              thrusting and magmatic accretion.  Evaluation of these models                  
              will utilize mineral thermobarometry, fabric analysis and U-Pb                 
              Zircon geochronology and pertains to a larger view of the orogen               
              as either a collisional welt related to terrane accretion, or as               
              a complex Andean-type magmatic arc developed on the edge of the                
              North American craton.
