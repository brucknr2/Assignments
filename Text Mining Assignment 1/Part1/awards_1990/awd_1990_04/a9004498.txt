Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Fertility depends upon timely ovulation, which is induced by a                 
              pituitary hormone, gonadotropin, the secretion of which is, in turn,           
              controlled by a releasing hormone synthesized in the hypothalamus.  The        
              neurons which synthesize this releasing hormone, Luteinizing hormone           
              relcasing hormone ?LHRH!, are dispersed as individual cells or small           
              clusters of cells across a broad region of the base of the brain.              
              Apparently diffuse, the positioning of these LHRH neurons may be               
              exquisitely regulated to facilitate integration of multiple internal           
              and external factors to synchronize secretion and optimize reproductive        
              success.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              Previous experiments using computer-assisted visualization techniques          
              indicate that this group of neurons is composed of diverse subgroups.          
              Using specialized staining procedures, i.e. immunocytochemistry,               
              together with automated computerized visualization techniques, Dr. King        
              will examine the hypotheses that: ?1! activity is enhanced in a "core"         
              subgroup of neurons in relation to the LH surge, using a marker protein        
              ?c-fos! as an indicator metabolic/secretory activity; ?2! the pattern          
              of neural input to the diverse subgroups of LHRH neurons differ, using         
              tracing techniques and specialized staining techniques to identify the         
              transmitters involved; and finally ?3! a "core" subgroup controls the          
              activity of other subgroups.                                                   
                                                                                             
              These studies will yield important insights into the mechanisms that           
              control this critical system of neurons.
