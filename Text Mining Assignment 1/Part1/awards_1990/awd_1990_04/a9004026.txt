Abstract    :
                This research is to use the study of the S-P converted phase                 
              S670P generated at the 670 km discontinuity beneath subduction                 
              zones to constrain the nature of the discontinuity and its                     
              dynamical significance.  After successful mapping beneath the                  
              Tonga subduction zone, new areas such as the Izu-Bonin, Marianas,              
              Java, Japan, and Kurile arcs will be investigated.  Moment tensor              
              solutions, where available, will be used to account for amplitude              
              effects.  This work has significance in the current controversy                
              as to the depth of penetration of the subducting slab into the                 
              lower mantle.
