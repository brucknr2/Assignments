Abstract    :
                   This award provides 50% of the funding needed to construct                
              five special design reaction vessels for use at high pressure and              
              temperature. The design, construction and operation of the                     
              pressure vessels will be under the direction of the Principal                  
              Investigator in the Division of Geological & Planetary Sciences                
              at the California Institute of Technology. Caltech will provide                
              the remaining 50% funding necessary for the project.                           
                   The proposed apparatus incorporates a novel feature whereby               
              the sample is magnetically levitated during an experiment and can              
              be rapidly moved into and out of the hot zone within the vessel                
              without release of pressure. The vessels will be used in a wide                
              variety of projects aimed at understanding the behavior of                     
              volatile components in natural and synthetic model igneous                     
              systems, including: investigations of the partitioning of                      
              hydrogen isotopes between vapor and silicate melts and its                     
              relation to the speciation of water in magmatic liquids; studies               
              of the solubility and diffusion of water and carbon dioxide in                 
              silicate glasses and melts; study of the partitioning of carbon                
              isotopes between vapor and silicate melts.
