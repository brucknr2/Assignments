Abstract    :
              This research is being funded by the Organic Synthesis                         
              Chemistry Program.  It is a continuation of research in the                    
              same area.  Dr. Hoffman has developed the chemistry of a group                 
              of compounds that permits the highly flexible synthesis of                     
              number of important classes of structures such as amino acids                  
              and heterocycles.  These reactions have the potential to                       
              simplify the synthesis of otherwise difficultly obtainable                     
              substances.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              The use of 2-sulfonyloxy carbonyl compounds in synthesis has                   
              received considerable attention in recent years.  2-Sulfonyloxy                
              carbonyl compounds (ketones and esters) can be prepared readily                
              from enol derivatives of carbonyl compounds, and the                           
              sulfonyloxy group introduces distinct reactivity to the                        
              product.  Of greatest interest is that 2-sulfonyloxy carbonyl                  
              compounds undergo very clean nucleophilic substitution.  This                  
              propensity has been exploited in simple 2-sulfonyloxy ketones                  
              and esters as a means to synthesize 2-substituted ketones and                  
              unusual amino acid esters.  The planned work involves the                      
              synthesis of selected, new 2-sulfonyloxy carbonyl compounds,                   
              and exploits their special reactivity for the preparation of                   
              densely functionalized products.  Three specific objectives are                
              set: a) to develop methodology for the synthesis of chiral                     
              3-hydroxy-2-nosyloxy esters and their elaboration into chiral                  
              1,2,3-trifunctionalized compounds, b) to develop the use of                    
              unsaturated nosyloxy esters for the synthesis of unsaturated                   
              ester derivatives, and c) to continue studies on the                           
              electrophilic addition to enamine and enol derivatives of                      
              2-ketoesters.
