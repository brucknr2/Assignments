Abstract    :
              The project will utilize the loss estimation                                   
              procedures developed in a previous work in                                     
              which a Damage Assessment Handbook was also                                    
              generated.  These methodology will be applied                                  
              to estimate the damages produced by two                                        
              consecutive natural disasters occurred some                                    
              months ago, Hurricane Hugo and the Loma Prieta                                 
              earthquake.  These two events of a quite                                       
              different physical nature, will be the test                                    
              cases providing a unique opportunity for                                       
              determining the extent and magnitude of                                        
              economic dislocations and direct losses                                        
              produced by each of them.  The comparison                                      
              between these two cases will also validate the                                 
              effectiveness of the new damage assessment                                     
              procedure as applied to any natural hazard.                                    
              Five issues will be addressed:  a) what                                        
              procedures did agencies follow to estimate                                     
              direct damages, and what is the quality of the                                 
              data used; b) using the Damage Assessment                                      
              Handbook, what were the direct damages and how                                 
              sizeable were the economic dislocations; c)                                    
              what were the measures taken to soften the                                     
              impact of the economic dislocations; d) what                                   
              was the impact on historical sites and                                         
              cultural patrimony; and e) what accounting                                     
              stance (local, state or national) was used.                                    
              The results of this work will benefit the                                      
              research community, post-audit process, the                                    
              insurance and construction industries, the                                     
              agencies, planners and administrators.
