Abstract    :
              The long term goal of this research is to understand the                       
              functional organization and structural dynamics of the RecA and                
              RecBCD enzymes in order to determine how their many activities                 
              are coordinated in carrying out the overall process of genetic                 
              recombination.  The regions of these enzymes that are involved in              
              particular functions, e.g. DNA binding, ATP binding and                        
              hydrolysis, and oligomeric contacts will be identified.  Once                  
              regions of the proteins have been identified as critical for a                 
              given function, a variety of mutagenic techniques will be used,                
              combined with appropriate genetic selections and screens, to                   
              detail the structural requirements for that function.  Resulting               
              mutant proteins will also be analyzed for their ability to                     
              undergo ligand-induced conformational changes, a feature of many               
              multifunctional enzymes which underlies their ability to                       
              coordinate various catalytic activities.  Further genetic                      
              analysis of the relationship between protein structure and                     
              function will be performed by using a number of the recombination              
              deficient mutant proteins obtained in this study to select                     
              androgenic second site revertants. The analyses of RecA and                    
              RecBCD will serve to provide both a more detailed molecular                    
              description of genetic recombination, as well as further insights              
              into the mechanisms by which multifunctional, oligomeric enzymes               
              organize a variety of activities into an ordered enzymatic                     
              process.
