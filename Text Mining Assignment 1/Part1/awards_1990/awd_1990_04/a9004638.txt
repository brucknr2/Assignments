Abstract    :
              This grant supports Organization of the International                          
              Topical Meeting on Nonlinear Dynamics in Optical                               
              Systems, in Afton, Oklahoma, June 4-8, 1990.  The                              
              meeting will provide a Gordon-style conference on                              
              dynamical aspects of nonlinear optical systems for                             
              researchers principally in the fields of laser physics                         
              and quantum electronics. The workshop will focus on                            
              the physics underlying nonlinear optical systems such                          
              as in optical bistability, phase conjugation, multiwave                        
              mixing, optical fibers and waveguides, microscopic                             
              quantum systems including optically trapped atoms                              
              and ions, etc.  Invited speakers will represent many                           
              allied fields in which nonlinear dynamical phenomena                           
              are of considerable current interest, with the attempt                         
              to improve the unification and exchange of                                     
              information among disciplines in this area.  NSF                               
              funds will be specifically targeted to provide partial                         
              travel support for special lecturers in related fields                         
              and for young faculty, postdoctoral associates and                             
              graduate students.
