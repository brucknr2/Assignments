Abstract    :
              Howard University will host and jointly organize with                          
              Santa Clara University Third International                                     
              Conference on Amorphous and Crystalline Silicon                                
              Carbide and Related Materials.  It follows the                                 
              successful first and second ICACSC at Howard and                               
              Santa Clara Universities respectively.  The primary                            
              sponsors are the National Science Foundation, The                              
              Office of Naval Research, and IEEE Washington                                  
              Section-Electron Device Group.  This conference will                           
              bring together distinguished American and foreign                              
              researchers in the growth, characterization, and                               
              fabrication of crystalline and amorphous SIC devices                           
              and related materials.  These workers will present                             
              their current research and exchange new ideas on                               
              various approaches to current problems in the                                  
              realization of wide bandgap devices and circuits.
