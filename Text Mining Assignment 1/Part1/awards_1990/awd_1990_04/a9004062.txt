Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Two senior investigators and two postdocs will study various              
              aspects of differential geometry and Riemann surfaces.  One will               
              establish the finiteness of string theories to all orders of                   
              perturbation theory.  This will require the development of                     
              holomorphic supergeometry and new parametrizations of Teichmuller              
              space suggested by Feynman diagrams.  The second investigator                  
              will work on problems in complex differential geometry.  This                  
              will include a study of Hermitian symmetric domains, holomorphic               
              mappings between them, and their classification.  One postdoc                  
              will analyze homomorphic immersions between compact complex                    
              hyperbolic space forms.  The second will derive further estimates              
              for eigenvalues of manifolds with conelike singularities.                      
                   Four investigators will study various aspects of                          
              differential geometry.  Several of the problems to be studied                  
              have their origins in string theory.  This theory has been used                
              to describe complex interactions between elementary particles.                 
              In this theory, each particle is represented by a string which                 
              vibrates in ten dimensional space.  These investigations are part              
              of a continuing effort by mathematicians and physicists to use                 
              this new theory to explain the results of high-energy particle                 
              experiments.
