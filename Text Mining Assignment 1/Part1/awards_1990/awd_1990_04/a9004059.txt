Abstract    :
                   This work will carry out systematic analyses of (p, 2p)                   
              reactions using the Dirac distorted wave impulse approximation.                
              In contrast with previous work, the formalism is completely                    
              relativistic and preserves the full finite range character of                  
              the reaction processes.  Subsequently the (p,np) and (e,e'p)                   
              reactions will be examined.  The results will provide a better                 
              understanding of nucleon knockout reactions and the nature of                  
              the strong interaction in a nuclear medium.
