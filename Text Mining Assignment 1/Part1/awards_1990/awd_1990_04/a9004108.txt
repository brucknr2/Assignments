Abstract    :
              To study thermodynamic properties of multilayer films of various               
              adsorbates on uniform surfaces of graphite and other substrates.               
              The technique, currently used by them and by one group in                      
              Germany, combines ellipsometric measurement of coverage with                   
              vapor pressure measurement by conventional capacitance manometers              
              or by modified manometers operating at low temperature adjacent                
              to the sample.  Among the phenomena which will be studied are                  
              surface roughening and surface melting behavior of krypton,                    
              xenon, and methane films on graphite, including detailed                       
              examination of the layer critical points and inverse critical                  
              points which occur in fourth and higher layers, at least for                   
              krypton; exploration of the phase diagrams of neon and hydrogen                
              in the same thickness range; and wetting and layering behavior of              
              other interesting systems, such as carbon monoxide on graphite.                
              Other substrates will be examined besides graphite, including                  
              TiS2, TaSe2, and other layered dichalcogenides, cleaved surfaces               
              of ionic crystals such as LiF and MgO, and gold films evaporated               
              on mica.  A number of improvements in the experimental apparatus               
              will allow better precision in coverage and pressure measurement.
