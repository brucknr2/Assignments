Abstract    :
                   This research project consists of two parts, both trying to               
              study knot (link) invariants via representation varieties.  The                
              first part is a continuation of Lin's work wherein he defined a                
              knot invariant in terms of an intersection number of subvarieties              
              and related this knot invariant to a classical one.  To                        
              generalize this work, one can define other intersection numbers                
              and he is interested in relating these intersection numbers with               
              classical link invariants.  In the second part, he suggests a way              
              of constructing a 2-variable polynomial for a knot in S3,                      
              generalizing the definition of the Alexander polynomial via                    
              Seifert forms.  This construction is intimately related to                     
              representation varieties.  In particular, it suggests a possible               
              connection between the Jones polynomial and Casson's invariant of              
              homology 3-spheres.  Lin's hope is that this research will shed                
              some light on some important questions, such as how to generalize              
              the Jones polynomial from S3 to arbitrary 3-manifolds and how to               
              interpret the Jones polynomial in terms of the topology of the                 
              knot complement.                                                               
                   Knots in three-dimensional space are natural objects to                   
              study.  The polynomials Lin describes reduce the problem of                    
              distinguishing truly inequivalent knots from different                         
              presentations of the same knot to questions about polynomials,                 
              i.e. to fairly simple algebraic problems.  (This transition from               
              geometry to algebra turns out to be related to other mathematics               
              of no immediately apparent connection.)
