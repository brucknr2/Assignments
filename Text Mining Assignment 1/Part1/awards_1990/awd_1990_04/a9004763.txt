Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The overall goal of this research is to identify factors involved in           
              blue-light induced transcription of proteins in higher plants.  There          
              are two basic classes of transcription factors, core factors and               
              regulatory factors.  Core factors allow for low level, constitutive            
              expression.  Their presence or activity is not regulated and they              
              function for many genes.  Regulatory factors are not always active and         
              affect the rate of Pisum sativum (pea) and Arabidopsis thaliani to             
              identify the regulatory factors that effect blue-light transcription of        
              a pigment-binding protein found in plants.                                     
                                                                                             
              Blue light represents a regulatory signal for many events in growth and        
              development.  Examples of these events are found in all the kingdoms           
              and range from bacterial motion to alleviation of winter depression in         
              humans.  The basic biochemical mechanism by which blue light is                
              perceived and transduced into a signal useful for the cell is probably         
              very ancient.  Indeed, as light represents one of the oldest                   
              environmental cues, it may be that blue-light regulation is the oldest         
              signal.  Understanding this ancient mechanism will provide insight into        
              how cells interpret many extracellular signals.
