Abstract    :
              Dr. Peters proposed to study how protein structure controls                    
              the dynamics of the enthalpy and volume changes associated                     
              with the dissociation of carbon monoxide from myoglobin.  The                  
              method of analysis is time-resolved photoacoustic                              
              calorimetry.  Time-resolved photoacoustic calorimetry                          
              measures the dynamics of the enthalpy and volume changes for                   
              reactions that are initiated by light.  The resolution of the                  
              experiment is such that for reactions which occur in less                      
              than 100 nanoseconds, the sum of the enthalpy and volume                       
              changes are measured.  For reactions occurring between 100                     
              nanoseconds and 20 microseconds the dynamics of enthalpy and                   
              volume changes can be obtained.  For the past three years Dr.                  
              Peters has been examining the dynamics of enthalpy and volume                  
              changes associated with the photodissociation of carbon                        
              monoxide from sperm-whale, horse and human myoglobins.  He                     
              has found evidence for a new intermediate in sperm-whale                       
              myoglobin that is formed upon the dissociation of carbon                       
              monoxide which involves the breaking of a salt bridge and re-                  
              organization of the protein structure.  Following these                        
              initial observations Dr. Peters would like to investigate the                  
              nature of this protein structural change.  He will examine                     
              mutants of sperm-whale and human myoglobin, engineered by                      
              site directed mutagenesis, to determine the origin of the                      
              barrier to the formation of this intermediate.  Also, using                    
              combinations of buffers he will examine pH titration curves                    
              for the energetics and dynamics of the myoglobins in order to                  
              ascertain if structural changes are occurring within the                       
              protein that may effect the acidity of some amino acids.
