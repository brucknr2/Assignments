Abstract    :
              The role of amino acid side chains in decarboxylation reactions                
              catalyzed by Pseudomonas cepacia 2,2-dialklglycine decarboxylates              
              (EC 4.1.1.64), a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent enzyme which                 
              decarboxylates 2,2-dialklglycines and D-amino acids but                        
              transaminates L-amino acids, will be investigated using site                   
              directed mutagenesis.  The function of active site histidine and               
              lysine side chains will be studied by replacing these amino                    
              acids by alanine and glycine, respectively, and then using                     
              various small  molecules to mimic the function of the lost side                
              chains. These are prosthetic or auxiliary catalysts. This                      
              approach provides a direct test for the function of an active                  
              site side chain: If catalysis by the added molecules tends to be               
              more efficient with molecules that are more basic, then the                    
              original side chain is likely to function as a base.  If                       
              catalysis by the added molecules tends to be less efficient with               
              molecules that are more basic, then the original side chain                    
              likely functions as an acid.  A variety of small bases, first                  
              used by Toney and Kirsch to test the function of a lysine in                   
              aspartate aminotransferase  ?Science 243, 1485 (1989)!, will be                
              used to test the lysine of the dialklglycine decarboxylase.  A                 
              series of  imidazoles will be used to test the function of the                 
              active histidine in the same enzyme.
