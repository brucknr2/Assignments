Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The purpose of this travel award is to allow Dr.                               
              Douglas F. Williams to continue the dialogue with the                          
              Soviet Academy of Sciences (SAS) and USSR Ministry of                          
              Geology (MINGEO) about a program for long-term                                 
              research of Lake Baikal as it relates to global                                
              climate change, biogeochemical cycles, continental                             
              rifting and geophysics, and joint US-USSR continental                          
              scientific drilling.  This would build directly on                             
              earlier discussions about a possible Baikal Drilling                           
              Project (BDP) held at the University of South                                  
              Carolina in July 1989 and at Yaroslavl, Moscow and                             
              Irkutsk in August 1989.                                                        
                                                                                             
              Dr. Williams would also be able to discuss with his                            
              Soviet counterparts the results of the first processing                        
              by US geophysicists of Soviet geophysical multi-                               
              channel seismic (MCS) data from Lake Baikal, collected                         
              by the Institute of Oceanology (Moscow) in the summer                          
              of 1989.  That would be particularly important                                 
              because is shows real progress in the step-wise process                        
              of initiating US-USSR basic geoscience research on                             
              Lake Baikal.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              This project fulfills the program objective of                                 
              advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading                             
              researchers in the United States and the U.S.S.R. to                           
              combine complementary efforts and capabilities in                              
              areas of strong mutual interest and competence in the                          
              field of basic scientific research on the basis of                             
              equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.
