Abstract    :
                   The research project involves statistical resampling                      
              methods, analysis of directional data, survival analysis and                   
              semiparametric models. The development of a unified theory of                  
              resampling procedures that covers both the bootstrap and the                   
              jackknife methods will be supported. The resulting elements from               
              k sampled blocks from a sequence of stationary m-dependent random              
              variables will be used to provide bootstrap estimators of                      
              parameters and the properties of the estimators will be examined.              
              Questions of robustness of these resampling procedures will be                 
              investigated. Notions of data depth for directional data will be               
              developed along with nonparametric tests for them and                          
              corresponding classifications of data. Semiparametric models for               
              survival analysis will be be studied for both censored and non-                
              censored data.
