Abstract    :
              This SGER grants will assist Iowa State University in the                      
              acquisition of a scanning tunneling/atomic force microscope.  The              
              microscope will be utilized to examine the structure of                        
              chromosomes.  Particular emphasis will be focused on the                       
              structure of DNA in the telomeric region of the chromosome where               
              DNA pairing differs from normal Watson-Crick base pairing.
