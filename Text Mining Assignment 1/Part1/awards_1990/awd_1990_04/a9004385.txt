Abstract    :
              Most plant viruses replicate in directly inoculated cells from                 
              a wide range of plants, but show exquisite host specificity                    
              with respect to initiating cell-to-cell and/or sustaining                      
              subsequent systemic spread through the plant.  As a foundation                 
              for molecular study of the individual and collective role of                   
              plant virus genes in movement, systemic infection, and host                    
              specificity, the investigators have produced and characterized                 
              complete, infectious cDNA clones of several distinct                           
              bromoviruses of varying divergence in host range and genome                    
              sequence, and demonstrated that designed exchange of selected                  
              genes and gene segments between such viruses provides a                        
              powerful approach for identifying host specificity determinants                
              and characterizing their behavior.  Building on these tools and                
              the strong general characterization of bromovirus molecular                    
              biology, they will now:  follow infection movement at the                      
              cellular level to define the distinct stages at which systemic                 
              infection is blocked upon alteration of different virus genes;                 
              map host specificity effects to specific functional domains of                 
              several implicated virus genes and test a potentially powerful                 
              new approach to RNA virus genetic mapping based on natural RNA                 
              recombination; test preliminary indications that, contrary to                  
              the "gating " hypothesis, successful systemic infection                        
              requires mutual adaptation between the 3a movement gene and the                
              1a and 2a replication genes; determine whether the apparently                  
              post-replication influence of the 1a and 2a genes on systemic                  
              infection is truly independent of their known functions in RNA                 
              replication; and localize observed host specificity                            
              determinants in noncoding sequences surrounding the 3a gene and                
              determine their possible influence on 3a gene expression.  The                 
              results should provide clarifying concepts regarding the                       
              plant's response to the infective viruses.
