Abstract    :
                   This project will support research on inverse problems in                 
              partial differential equations.  In particular the research will               
              focus on the impedance tomography problem, the problem of                      
              characterization of the Dirichlet to Neumann map, the inverse                  
              conductivity problem for anisotropic conductivities in                         
              dimensions greater than or equal to three, and related problems                
              in inverse scattering and inverse problems that arise in                       
              differential geometry.                                                         
                   When an electric potential is applied to the surface of a                 
              conducting body, the resulting current flux across the surface                 
              depends on the internal resistance of the body.  For this reason,              
              voltage and current measurements made on the boundary of an                    
              object can be used to probe the internal structure of the body.                
              The problem is to determine as much information as possible about              
              the internal resistivity from measurements of voltage potentials               
              and corresponding current fluxes at the boundary.  This problem,               
              often referred to as impedance computed tomography or electrical               
              impedance imaging, arose in geophysics from attempts to determine              
              the composition of the earth.  More recently, it has been                      
              proposed as a potentially valuable diagnostic tool for the                     
              medical and biological sciences.
