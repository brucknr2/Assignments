Abstract    :
                   Knowledge of the posotion of the supercontinent of Laurentia              
              with respect to Gondwana and peri-Gondwanide terranes, such as                 
              Armorica, Iberia and Avalonia, is of paramount importance for the              
              proper understanding and quantification of geodynamic events                   
              during the Paleozoic.  Unfortunately, the paleomagnetic database               
              for the Silurian-Devonian of continents once part of Gondwana is               
              incomplete and provides few constraints on paleogeographic                     
              models.  The result has been the appearance of several                         
              controversial paleogeographic models with very different                       
              interpretations for this period.  One means of constraining or                 
              testing such reconstructions is through comparison with well                   
              interpreted and robust biogeographic patterns.  One major group                
              of marine invertebrates, the nautiloid cephalopods, is                         
              particularly well suited to this task.  A significant portion of               
              nautiloid evolution occurred during the Silurian-Devonian, the                 
              biogeographic database is large and can be made much better with               
              reasonable effort, analytical techniques are available to                      
              provide patterns of exceptional quality, and the spatial                       
              distributions of nautiloid cephalopods are now known to have been              
              particularly well controlled by barriers to dispersal of the                   
              magnitude easily recognized with proper methods.
