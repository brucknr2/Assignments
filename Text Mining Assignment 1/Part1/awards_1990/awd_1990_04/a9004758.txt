Abstract    :
                   This research project investigates multi-resolution pyramid               
              decompositions for images, generated by wavelet-type kernels, which            
              are compatible with human visual system processing and which                   
              provide efficient image coding. The generating kernels and their               
              bases are analyzed for their truncation, entropy reduction, and                
              rate-distortion theoretic properties relevant to the best visual               
              result for a given bit rate. Both still and moving (video) images              
              are treated.
