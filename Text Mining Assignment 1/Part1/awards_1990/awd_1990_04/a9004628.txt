Abstract    :
                   This is a grant under the Scientific Computing Research                   
              Equipment for the Mathematical Sciences program of the Division                
              of Mathematical Sciences of the National Sciences Foundation.                  
              This program supports the purchase of special purpose computing                
              equipment dedicated to the conduct of research in the                          
              mathematical sciences.  This equipment is required for several                 
              research projects and would be difficult to justify for one                    
              project alone.  Support from the National Science Foundation is                
              coupled with discounts and contributions from manufacturers and                
              with substantial cost-sharing from the institutions submitting                 
              the proposal.  This program is an example of academic,                         
              corporate, and government cooperation in the support of the basic              
              research in the mathematical sciences.                                         
                   This equipment will be used to support research projects by               
              D. Griffeath, J. T. Cox, and R. Durrett in the Departments of                  
              Mathematics of the University of Wisconsin, the University of                  
              Syracuse, and Cornell University, respectively.  At least two of               
              the three investigators will work on the following five projects:              
              nonlinear voter models, anti-stepping stone models, forest fires               
              and epidemics, cyclic wave dynamics, and growth models on Poisson              
              lattices.
