Abstract    :
              The processes that have initiated and terminated shallow-water                 
              carbonate platforms throughout Phanerozoic time are a focus of                 
              the Global Sedimentary Geology Project.  Exposures of an isolated              
              Triassic platform in Guizhou Province, PRC, provide an excellent               
              opportunity to document its birth and death, its internal                      
              sedimentary and diagenetic facies patterns, and the transitions                
              into the surrounding deeper water deposits.  Other objectives of               
              the field stratigraphic study include documenting the transition               
              from Permian to Triassic, apparently conformable but with a major              
              reduction in platform area, and applying concepts of sequence                  
              stratigraphy and cycle analysis to understanding the history of                
              the platform.                                                                  
              Fluid inclusions and conodont coloration will be used to                       
              establish the post-Triassic thermal history of this area and to                
              evaluate possible trends in heating which may indicate the most                
              favorable areas for hydrocarbon preservation.  Conodonts may help              
              improve intercontinental correlations, particularly at the Permo-              
              Triassic boundary.
