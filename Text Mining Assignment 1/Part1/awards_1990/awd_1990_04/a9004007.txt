Abstract    :
              The proposed research will focus on the mineralogic, and                       
              structural features preserved in gabbros and basalts of the Kap                
              Edvard Holm, Nordre Aputiteq and Patulajivit complexes in order                
              to characterize processes of elemental mass transfer related to                
              hydrothermal metasomatism, stoping and assimilation during                     
              rifting in the North Atlantic.  To achieve these goals we will                 
              address the following questions:                                               
              1) What are the cumulative effects of multiple intrusions on                   
              hydrothermal metasomatism and the evolution of porosity and                    
              permeability in gabbroic plutons and basaltic rocks?                           
              2) How does hydrothermal metasomatism of host rocks affect                     
              subsequent mass transfer from host rocks to magma during stoping               
              and assimilation?                                                              
              Completion of the research outlined in this proposal will provide              
              a framework for understanding the geochemical and structural                   
              evolution of gabbro-hosted magma-hydrothermal systems during                   
              crustal rifting.
