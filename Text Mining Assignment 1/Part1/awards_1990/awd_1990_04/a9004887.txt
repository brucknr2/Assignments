Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Calcitonin is a peptide hormone produced by special cells in              
              the mammalian thyroid gland and the ultimobranchial gland of                   
              birds and fish.  In mammals, the hormone is secreted into the                  
              bloodstream in response to a rise in blood calcium.  It travels                
              to the kidney and bone where is acts on target cells that respond              
              by enhancing renal calcium excretion and reducing bone breakdown,              
              thereby lowering blood calcium back to normal.  Dr. Cooper has                 
              shown that calcitonin produces behavioral changes when it is                   
              introduced into the CNS.  Indeed, this peptide has profound                    
              effects on food and water intake, pain perception, and gastric                 
              acid secretion.  Yet, calcitonin has not been found naturally in               
              the brain, and circulating calcitonin cannot get through the                   
              blood-brain barrier.  Dr. Cooper suggests that a calcitonin-like               
              molecule is present in the CNS but has not been identified                     
              because it is different than the one produced in the periphery by              
              the thyroid hormone.  He will use structural analogs of                        
              calcitonin to isolate CNS receptors, and to determine whether                  
              more than one subtype of calcitonin receptor exists.  Dr. Cooper               
              will then compare the properties of the CNS and peripheral                     
              calcitonin receptors to determine their similarities and                       
              differences.  In addition, he will characterize the peptide                    
              sequences that when introduced into the CNS initiate feeding,                  
              drinking and gastric acid secretion.  This work will increase our              
              general understanding of how peptides act as chemical messengers               
              in the brain.  Moreover, potential usefulness of this work for                 
              the development of pharmacological agents for pain control and                 
              gastric acid secretion is noted.
