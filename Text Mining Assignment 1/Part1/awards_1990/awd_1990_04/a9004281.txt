Abstract    :
                   Senescence of whole plants and of plant organs os                         
              moderately well understood physiologically.  The PI will begin a               
              nine-month program away from the home institution with a three-                
              month internship at a leading center for physiological and                     
              ecological research (Carnegie Institute of Washington and                      
              Stanford University"s Department of Biological Sciences),                      
              learning senescence physiology, measuring nitrogen movement                    
              within and out of senescing plants, and investigating the                      
              consequences of two kinds of experimentally induced leaf                       
              senescence on plant productivity.  The short-term productivity                 
              measurements will expose the PI to current techniques for                      
              measuring light, photosynthesis, and respiration.  Next, the PI                
              will spend six months at a field station in Costa Rica, where                  
              the Pi will use the knowledge and techniques acquired at                       
              Carnegie to conduct field experiments.  The target organisms                   
              will be evergreen perennial, a group of plants that is crucial to              
              the design of sustainable agricultural systems and to the                      
              understanding of tropical forest dynamics.  If successful, this                
              research will enable scientists to accelerate or delay plant                   
              senescence by manipulating light and soul nutrients.
