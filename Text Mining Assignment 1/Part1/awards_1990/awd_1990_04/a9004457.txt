Abstract    :
                    New paleomagnetic results from the Contessa section of the               
              Umbrian Apennines (northern Italy) fill a  14 my sampling gap in               
              previous studies and reveal a series of Albian reversed polarity               
              intervals within the Cretaceous Normal Polarity Superchron.                    
              These new data imply a drastic revision of the mid Cretaceous                  
              polarity pattern.  These reversed intervals could have broad                   
              applications in the correlation of the striking geologic                       
              characteristics of mid-Cretaceous sections, such as black shale                
              deposition.  This proposal seeks to confirm the presence of the                
              Contessa reversed polarity intervals by a joint paleomagnetic and              
              paleontologic investigation of the following two sections: (1)                 
              Poggio le Guaine (Umbrian Apennines, northern Italy) and (2)                   
              Tignale (Lombardian Basin, northern Italy).  Project may enable                
              refinement of geologic time scale and may reveal timing of                     
              deposition of important petroleum source rocks.
