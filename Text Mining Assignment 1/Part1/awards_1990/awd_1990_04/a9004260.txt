Abstract    :
              This award is for support of a research program to use nuclear                 
              magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy in conjunction with other                
              analytical techniques to investigate four important issues of                  
              mineralogical and geochemical interest.  These issues are: 1) the              
              behavior of important, rock-forming minerals undergoing                        
              structural phase transitions, 2) the structural environments of                
              hydrogen-containing species in aluminosilicate glasses and the                 
              mechanisms of diffusion of these species in these glasses, 3)                  
              cation order/disorder in some phases stable at high pressure that              
              may be important minerals in the earth's mantle, and 4) the                    
              structural environments and dynamic behavior of cations adsorbed               
              on clay minerals.  The work will be carried out by the P.I. and                
              his associated at the University of Illinois.
