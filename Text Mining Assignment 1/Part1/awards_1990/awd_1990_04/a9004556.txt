Abstract    :
                This research interprets seismicity and geodetic data in terms               
              of the geometry and stressing of locked fault zones which will                 
              rupture in large earthquakes.  The studies will be carried out in              
              the framework of the asperity model which regards a portion of a               
              seismically active fault zone as being effectively locked against              
              slip, except in large earthquakes, while adjacent portions of the              
              zone slip aseismically, or with lower level seismicity, and do                 
              not accumulate comparable stress.  The initial focus will be on                
              modelling of the Shumagin Islands subduction segment in Alaska,                
              and the Parkfield region along the San Andreas fault.  This                    
              research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard                      
              Reduction Program.
