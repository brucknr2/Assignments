Abstract    :
                   This proposal is to support a graduate student for two years              
              to thoroughly research the Indonesian geodetic archives of the                 
              Dutch period in West Java and the archives of the Netherlands                  
              Geodetic Commission in Delft, and to perform a strain analysis                 
              across the Great Sumatran Fault System using historical                        
              triangulation data located in these archives and ongoing GPS                   
              measurements.  This work will be coordinated with two Indonesian               
              colleagues who will also be using the triangulation and GPS data               
              as part of their doctoral studies.  These data will provide                    
              important constraints on the decoupling of oblique convergence                 
              west of Sumatra into subduction normal to the margin between the               
              Indian-Australian and Eurasian plates and right-lateral faulting               
              parallel to it.  Specifically, this comparison will enable us to               
              measure horizontal strain rates both along the Sumatran fault to               
              outline sections of differing fault behavior and far from the                  
              "fault, in the southwest to constrain the partitioning os shear"               
              "throughout the forearc, and in the northeast to study the                     
              accumulation of elastic strain across the Sumatran Fault system.               
              In addition, these data will provide valuable information on                   
              earthquake-and fault-related processes in this very seismically                
              active region.  These data are particularly valuable since the                 
              Dutch often resurveyed parts of the triangulation network after                
              earthquakes.
