Abstract    :
              The goal of this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and                    
              Organometallic Chemistry Program is the development of new                     
              methods for stereoselective synthesis of organic compounds                     
              based on compounds containing such transition metals as                        
              tungsten and molybdenum. Such methods are extremely important                  
              because the three-dimensional structure of a molecule can                      
              affect profoundly its chemical and biological properties.                      
                                                                                             
              The two aims of the project are the development of new methods                 
              using metal complexes for asymmetric and regioselective                        
              syntheses and the elucidation of the mechanisms of                             
              stereoselective reactions which are synthetically useful. The                  
              potential utility of higher oxidation state organometallic                     
              complexes for these applications will be explored also. A new                  
              method will be developed for obtaining detailed structural                     
              information for organometallic compounds in solution. Ligands                  
              containing paramagnetic metal ions which bind to                               
              organometallics will be designed and synthesized. NMR                          
              measurements using these new shift reagents will allow detailed                
              delineation of structure (angles and distances) of reactive                    
              organometallic species, especially catalytic intermediates,                    
              which exist only in solution.
