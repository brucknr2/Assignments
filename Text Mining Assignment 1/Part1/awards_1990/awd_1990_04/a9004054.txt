Abstract    :
              We shall develop the tools for introducing genes into the plastid              
              genome of higher plants using Nicotiana tabacum, a suitable model              
              species.  Lack of plastid transformation in higher plants has been             
              due to problems of a large plastid genome copy number in a cell,               
              lack of appropriate selective markers, and an effective way of DNA             
              delivery.  First, we shall transform wild-type plastids with                   
              plastid 16S rRNA genes that confer resistance to antibiotics.                  
              Introduction of DNA will be by bombardment with DNA-coated tungsten            
              particles.  Transformation will result in gene replacement.                    
              Research will be extended to study the requirements of inserting               
              foreign DNA into the plastid genome.  Oligonucleotide, and gene-               
              size segments of DNA will be linked to the selective markers.                  
              Incorporation of oligonucleotides will be used to select suitable              
              sites for gene insertion.  Larger segments of DNA will include                 
              chimeric genes.  Involvement of copy correction will be determined             
              in the formation of stable transgenic plastid genomes.  Information            
              derived from proposed research will make feasible the study of                 
              plastid gene regulation and function in transgenic plants.                     
                                                                                             
              This research will develop a plastid transformation protocol for               
              higher plants.  This is a very important tool for further genetic              
              engineering of plants.
