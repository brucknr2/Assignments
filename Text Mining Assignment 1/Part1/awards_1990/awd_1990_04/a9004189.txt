Abstract    :
                   This award provides funds to acquire an automated                         
              temperature-pressure control system and an anvil guideblock                    
              assembly that will be incorporated into a multi-anvil high                     
              pressure apparatus operated in the Center for Lithospheric                     
              Studies at the University of Texas-Dallas.                                     
                   The high-pressure-temperature (up to 250 kilobars and 2000C)              
              equipment will be used for phase equilibrium studies emphasizing               
              a systematic study of melting relationships in model systems that              
              approximate the Earth's mantle in composition.
