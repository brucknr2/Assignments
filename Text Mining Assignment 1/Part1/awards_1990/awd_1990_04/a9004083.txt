Abstract    :
              A new spectroscopic approach using the positron annihilation                   
              lifetime technique will be used to determine the free-volume                   
              hole-size distributions in polymeric materials.  The research                  
              activities involve:  1) positron lifetime measurements as a                    
              function of temperature and pressure in epoxy, poly(vinyl                      
              acetate), PMMA and PEEK polymers, and 2) a renaissance of                      
              positron lifetime spectroscopy by significantly improving nuclear              
              counting efficiency and instrument resolution, and by employing                
              numerical Laplace inversion techniques to analyze the positron                 
              lifetime data.  The free-volume hole-size distributions in these               
              selected polymers are to be determined experimentally for the                  
              first time as a part of the research.
