Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The overall goal of this proposal is to determine the mechanism                
              by which the amino acid sequence of a protein directs the rapid                
              and efficient folding to the native conformation.  The approach                
              is to use site-directed mutagenesis to identify sidechains                     
              which play key roles in folding.  Those that have such roles                   
              will, when replaced, have discernable effects on the                           
              equilibrium and kinetic properties of folding.  The protein to                 
              be studied is dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) from Escherchia                   
              coli.  DHFR is a relatively small monomeric protein which has                  
              no disulfide bonds or prosthetic groups and for which a high                   
              resolution X-ray structure exists.  A combination of                           
              absorbance, fluorescence and circular dichroism spectroscopies                 
              have been used to establish a folding model for DHFR.  This                    
              model postulates the existence of a number of transient folding                
              intermediates whose structures and energetics will be studied.                 
              The rate limiting steps in folding which immediately precede                   
              the native conformation will also be subjects for further                      
              investigation.  The information obtained from these studies                    
              will enhance the possibility of predicting the tertiary                        
              structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence, advance                   
              our understanding of the molecular defects in genetically                      
              transmitted diseases, and improve our ability to alter enzymes                 
              to improve catalytic properties.
