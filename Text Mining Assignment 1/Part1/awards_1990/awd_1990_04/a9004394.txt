Abstract    :
              In this project, the PI's will collect data on hydrographic and                
              tracer parameters on a line along 88|W, referred to, in the World              
              Ocean Circulation Experiment, as WOCE line P-19.  The PI's will                
              also collaborate on the analysis of data from several similar                  
              lines, either already completed, or to be completed in the next                
              year, to describe the basic state of circulation in the South                  
              Pacific over an approximately two-year period.  The state of the               
              ocean circulation will yield new insights into the role of the                 
              ocean in regulating climate variability.
