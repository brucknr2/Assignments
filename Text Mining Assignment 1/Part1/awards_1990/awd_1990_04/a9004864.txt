Abstract    :
                   A central element of the theory of the general circulation                
              of the ocean is the overturning in the meridional plane.  This                 
              proposal, an element of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment                 
              (WOCE), will deploy mid-depth floats in the Brazil Basin as part               
              of the Deep Basin Experiment (DBE).  The investigators will                    
              obtain displacement and velocity, as well as temperature and                   
              conductivity from floats tracked acoustically for up to 2 years.               
              The data will be analyzed in concert with fixed moorings,                      
              hydrographic measurements of the density field and tracers, and                
              numerical models.  Major components of the DBE will be done by                 
              other countries.
