Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Organelle motility, in some eucaryotic cells, is dependent on                  
              microtubules, a complex network of proteins filaments found in                 
              the cytoplasm of the cell.  Synaptic vesicles are motile                       
              secretory vesicles that store neurotransmitters.  These vesicles               
              are found in the axon, an extension of the nerve cell,                         
              responsible for transmitting signals to other cells.  Various                  
              types of vesicular organelles exhibit different patterns of                    
              movement.  This project will investigate and characterize, with                
              the use of video microscopy, the movement of synaptic vesicles in              
              the giant squid axon, and the motility of microtubule-dependent                
              organelles in adrenocortical tumor cells.  The movement of                     
              synaptic vesicles is considered a good model for other organelles              
              that are influenced by hormones such as ACTH.  Thus, this study                
              will further our understanding of the molecular basis of                       
              organelle movement and the mechanisms by which the spatial and                 
              temporal distribution of organelles are regulated by cells.
