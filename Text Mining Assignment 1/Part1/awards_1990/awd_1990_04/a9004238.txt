Abstract    :
              All plasmas are subject to a variety of instabilities, irrespective of         
              the type of devices in which these are produced and their intended             
              applications.  These include plasma sources for neutral, electron and          
              ion beams, any type of arc discharge, plasma etching devices for solid         
              state processing, basic experimental devices, geophysical and                  
              astrophysical plasma and fusion machines.  The deleterious                     
              consequences of the instabilities are many:  non-uniformities in               
              plasma, increased transport and, if violent enough, a macroscopic              
              break up.  These can lead minimally to degradation of the performance          
              of the device or system and sometimes to its break down.  Therefore            
              the elimination of these instabilities is always desirable and                 
              sometimes imperative.  This project continues research into active             
              feedback control of plasma instabilities.  Specifically, a new remote          
              suppressor using a small ion beam will be used, which will have                
              minimal perturbation to the system.  Robust controllers will also be           
              studied.  Applications of these controllers to industrial plasma               
              devices will be explored.  Two faculty members and one graduate                
              student will carry out the proposed research using the facilities of           
              the Columbia University Plasma Research Laboratory.  The experimental          
              work will utilize the redesigned Columbia Linear Machine.
