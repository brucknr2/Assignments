Abstract    :
              The main objectives of this project are: (1) to understand the                 
              relationship among various properties of pyrite (e.g.                          
              reflectivity, hardness, anisotropy, lattice cells, sulfur                      
              deficiency, conductivity, surface reactivity, 34S), the specific               
              pathways of pyrite formation (e.g. replacement of stable or                    
              metastable iron monosulfide, direct precipitation from                         
              hydrothermal fluids), and the mechanisms of polysulfide                        
              generation (e.g. H2 diffusion, H2S - SO42-reaction) that are                   
              involved in the formation of hydrothermal pyrites, and (2) to                  
              determine the kinetic and the equilibrium sulfur isotopic                      
              fractionation factors between pyrite and various aqueous sulfur                
              species.  These objectives will be pursued by a variety of                     
              hydrothermal experiments to synthesize iron disulfide minerals at              
              200oC - 350oC, by mineralogical, chemical, electrochemical and                 
              sulfur isotopic investigations of the experimental run products.               
              The results from this project may provide a set of mineralogical               
              and isotopic indicators of geochemical processes and                           
              environments of ore formation, and of chemical and isotopic                    
              compositions of hydrothermal fluids as well as information useful              
              for the development of pyrite as a semiconductor.
