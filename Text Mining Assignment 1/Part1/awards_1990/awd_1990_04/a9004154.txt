Abstract    :
              Request to continue my research in the experimental, field, and                
              theoretical investigations of magmatic-hydrothermal processes.                 
              The center research on the elemental Cu, Mo, W with some                       
              extensions to Zn, Nb, Ta rather than examine a wide range of                   
              elements in a superficial manner.  1) examining this restricted                
              suite of elements in depth will make it possible to model the                  
              processes of interest more completely; 2) some subset of these                 
              elements is present in anomalous concentrations in most magmatic-              
              hydrothermal mineral deposits; and 3) early data (Tacker and                   
              Candela, 1987; Candela 1989b; Candela and Bouton, 1990 and                     
              appendix) have proven fruitful in answering fundamental questions              
              in ore genesis
