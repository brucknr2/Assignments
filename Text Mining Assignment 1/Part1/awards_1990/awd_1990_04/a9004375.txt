Abstract    :
                This research is to study earthquake fault behavior and                      
              regional deformation by means of newly developed theoretical                   
              techniques.  These methods invert geodetic elevation changes,                  
              triangulation measurements, VLBI baseline data and tide gauge                  
              observations to recover the location and intensity of slip on                  
              shallow earthquake faults.  The goal is to develop quantitative                
              pictures of coseismic, postseismic and interseismic strain                     
              accumulation and release.  This research is a component of the                 
              National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
