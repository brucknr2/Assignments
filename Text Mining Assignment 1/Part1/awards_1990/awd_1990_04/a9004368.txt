Abstract    :
              This project is to investigate the origins and tectonic                        
              significance of intermediate composition flood eruptives that re               
              associated with continental rifts.  Chemical and radiometric                   
              isotopic analyses of approximately 10 natural flood phonolite and              
              trachyte lavas will be used to constrain possible source                       
              reservoir(s) and the evolution of these lavas.  Melting                        
              experiments on samples from this suite will be used to examine                 
              the processes and the P, T. and composition conditions necessary               
              for the genesis of these lavas.  Possible source mineralogies,                 
              polybaric and polythermal crystallization sequences, and the role              
              of volatiles in partial melting and mass transport will be                     
              identified.  Complementary studies of compositionally simplified               
              analog systems will facilitate interpretation of phase relations               
              and extrapolation of results to different magma compositions.                  
              Forward approach studies, if appropriate, will test petrogenetic               
              models that result from the inverse experiments.                               
              The result of this integrated experimental and analytical                      
              approach are relevant to understanding heat and mass transfer                  
              from mantle to crust during rifting, identifying the involvement               
              of crust in rift magmatism, and developing geophysical models for              
              rift evolution and structure.
