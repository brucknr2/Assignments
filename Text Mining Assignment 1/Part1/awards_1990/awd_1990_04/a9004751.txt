Abstract    :
                   Mid-Ordovician/Early Silurian land plant spores can                       
              contribute to the resolution of two important problems.  Land                  
              plant spores provide the only entrance into terrestrial and fresh              
              H2O environments in this interval of Phanerozoic time.  The                    
              research described in this proposal is the first to attempt to                 
              establish a Late Ordovician/Early Silurian nonmarine                           
              biostratigraphy and phytogeography.                                            
                   Throughout the post-Silurian Phanerozoic, land plant                      
              spores/pollen have proved vital in stratigraphic zonation of                   
              nonmarine and shallow-water, nearshore marine rocks.  Only local               
              attempts have been made to extend spore biostratigraphy into the               
              Late Silurian, and none effectively into the pre-Late Silurian.                
              It now appears possible to establish a continuous biostratigraphy              
              for shallow-water nearshore marine and nonmarine rocks from the                
              mid-Ordovician to the Devonian.                                                
                   This will be the first zonation possible for nonmarine                    
              rocks; it will also provide the only precise means of correlating              
              shallow-water, nearshore, Late Ordovician-Silurian strata since                
              marine invertebrates/organic microfossils are absent or not                    
              presently biostratigraphically useful in the nearshore facies.                 
                   Equally important is the fact that the spore-producing                    
              plants represent a hitherto unknown group of land plants that                  
              placed an important source of vegetation into continental                      
              habitats well before the traditional Early Devonian benchmark                  
              commonly considered to mark the major, initial radiation of the                
              tracheophytes.
