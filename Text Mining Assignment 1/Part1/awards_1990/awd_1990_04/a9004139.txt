Abstract    :
              The research proposed focusses on the biochemical                              
              characterization of nucleotide-protein interactions                            
              required for maintenance of the 2-5A synthetase/RNase L                        
              pathway, a vital process in cellular antiviral defense.                        
              RNase L is distinctive among nucleases in its dependence on 2-                 
              5A for activation and cleavage specificity at uridylate                        
              residues.  The molecular mechanism of 2-5A in the binding and                  
              activation of RNase L will be examined.  To this end, The Pi                   
              chemically synthesized a new class of metabolically stable                     
              agonists and antagonists of 2-5A to study the biochemical                      
              processes for RNA hydrolysis in vitro and in vivo.                             
              Transmembrane passage of the 2', 5`-phosphorothioates into                     
              virus infected cells will be accomplished by poly(L-lysine)                    
              conjugation and the effect of these probes on the stability of                 
              viral and cellular mRNA will be measured.  In addition,                        
              experiments are designed to examine (i) the order of addition                  
              of the substrate and allosteric activator to RNase L needed for                
              productive complex formation, (ii) the requirement for                         
              complementary base pairing between 2-5A and RNA for RNase L                    
              activation, and (iii) the contribution of each 2', 5'-                         
              phosphodiester bond in 2-5A to the binding and activation                      
              processes of RNase L.  Finally, mono- and bifunctional                         
              nucleotide site-directed affinity labels have been                             
              synthesized to study the acceptor and 2' -adenylation sites of                 
              recombinant 40 kDA, homogeneously pure 100 kDa and 110 kDa 2-5A                
              synthetases, the ATP binding site of protein kinase, and the                   
              2-5A binding site of RNase L.
