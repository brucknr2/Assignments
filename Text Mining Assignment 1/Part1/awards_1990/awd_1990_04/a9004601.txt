Abstract    :
                   PI will investigate the early history of the Metazoa by                   
              obtaining new field and laboratory data which may be used to                   
              construct accurate models of some key taxa.  The field work                    
              proposed would be carried out in the Soviet Union in 1989 and in               
              South Australia in 1990; the laboratory studies will include                   
              methods that will yield information about the nature of early                  
              mineral skeletons; and the modeling will be largely done using 2D              
              and 3D computer-aided-design (CAD) software and finite element                 
              analysis (FEA).  Both the late Precambrian soft-bodied metazoans               
              (Ediacara Fauna) and early Cambrian calcareous and phosphatic                  
              microfossils will be studied as part of this project.
