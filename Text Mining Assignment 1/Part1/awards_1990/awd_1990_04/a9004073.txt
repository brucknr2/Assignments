Abstract    :
              Professor William Steele is supported by a grant from The                      
              Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to perform                     
              computer simulations of many-body dynamics in liquids.  The                    
              proposed calculations are important as an aid to understanding                 
              molecular motion in liquids and the effects of this motion on                  
              the observed infrared, Raman, and depolarized light scattering                 
              spectra.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              Computer simulations based on realistic intermolecular                         
              interaction potentials will be employed to give representations                
              of actual molecules, chosen so that experimental data are                      
              available for comparison.  Properties to be studied depend on                  
              the translational and rotational motion of the molecules which                 
              composed the liquids.  These properties include: far and near                  
              infrared spectra; Raman and depolarized light scattering                       
              spectra; thermal transport coefficients; and nuclear spin                      
              dipole-dipole relaxation times.  Theory indicates that these                   
              phenomena involve two-, three-, and four-body dynamical                        
              contributions.  Steele proposes to study the relative                          
              magnitudes and timescales for each of these many-body                          
              contributing factors.  Molecules proposed for study range from                 
              simple molecules such as carbon monoxide up to relatively                      
              complex ones such as ethyl hexyl benzoate where there is                       
              competition between intramolecular reorientation and                           
              whole-molecule motions.
