Abstract    :
              The goal of this research program is to discover the details of                
              the sulfide mineral oxidation reaction mechanism.  A series of                 
              measurements of oxidation rates for several different sulfide                  
              minerals, show different reaction orders for different minerals                
              as well as two distinct ranges of activation energies.  These                  
              differences are presumably caused by differences in the overall                
              reaction mechanism. The P.I. have used thermodynamic and kinetic               
              information on individual aqueous sulfur species and elementary                
              reactions taken from the literature to  construct a general model              
              of the sulfide mineral oxidation reaction mechanism.  They                     
              propose to refine this model using experimental data, gathered                 
              as part of this research, on the effects of various catalysts and              
              inhibitors (chemical probes of the mechanism) on the rate of the               
              overall reaction and on the distribution of sulfur species in the              
              reacted solution.  These data will eventually be woven into a                  
              quantitative numerical model that should prove useful in a wide                
              range of scientific and  technological endeavors.
