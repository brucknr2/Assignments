Abstract    :
                   The coast of South Carolina received a direct hit from                    
              hurricane Hugo in late September of 1989.  In addition to major                
              economic loss, the native plants were severely  damaged from                   
              wind, salinity and flooding.  The next year or two represent a                 
              unique opportunity to examine the effects of a hurricane on                    
              coastal plants to determine if or how quickly they recover and to              
              asses their role in stabilizing the coast.  Dr. Young will                     
              investigate  changes in an ecologically important coastal shrub,               
              wax myrtle (Myrica  cerifera), based on photosynthetic responses               
              to the storm and the post-hurricane environment.  The research is              
              designed to take advantage of existing data and to support other               
              proposed studies of hurricane damage.                                          
                   At two month intervals over the next year, photosynthesis of              
              wax myrtle leaves and bark will be measured at three sites                     
              differing in the extent of hurricane damage at north Inlet of                  
              South Carolina.  In addition, a greenhouse experiment with potted              
              plants will separate the effects of salt damage and water-logged               
              soils on wax myrtle photosynthesis using environmental conditions              
              measured after the storm.  These experiments will determine how                
              quickly wax myrtle recovers after a hurricane and will provide                 
              insight into the value of wax myrtle for reducing coastal erosion              
              from storms.
