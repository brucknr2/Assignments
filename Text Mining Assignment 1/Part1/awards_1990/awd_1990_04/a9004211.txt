Abstract    :
                   This award will provide one-half the funds necessary to                   
              purchase two computer workstations for seismological and                       
              geophysical research in the Department of Earth and Planetary                  
              Sciences at Washington University, St. Louis. The remaining funds              
              needed are to be committed by Washington University.                           
                   The workstations will be used primarily for NSF sponsored                 
              research projects including  the study of deep seismic                         
              attenuation and velocity structure of back- arc rifts, near-                   
              source structural effects on earthquake body waveforms, the                    
              source parameters of earthquakes (particularly tsunami                         
              earthquakes), and the study of intraplate deformation and stress               
              using earthquake seismology and stress modeling.
