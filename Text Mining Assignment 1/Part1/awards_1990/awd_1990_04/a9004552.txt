Abstract    :
              Dr. Jack H. Freed is supported by a grant from the Experimental                
              Physical Chemistry Program to study molecular relaxation by                    
              electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy. These studies                      
              provide valuable insight into the mechanisms of molecular                      
              motion and also into the rapidly emerging medical area of                      
              magnetic imaging of the human body.                                            
                                                                                             
              A variety of newly developed ESR relaxation techniques are to                  
              be employed, and the necessary theoretical frameworks for                      
              understanding these experiments are also to be developed and                   
              extended. Specific projects include the following: (1) the                     
              further applications of the new two-dimensional                                
              Fourier-Transform electron-electron double resonance (2D-ELDOR)                
              technique to the study of rotational molecular dynamics in                     
              liquids; (2) the extension of 2D-ELDOR to the slow motional                    
              regime; (3) the application of field-swept 2D-electron spin                    
              echo techniques and slow-motional 2D-ELDOR to the study of                     
              viscous liquids and glasses; (4) studies of molecular dynamics                 
              on surfaces by 2D-ESR methods; (5) comparisons of microscopic                  
              vs. macroscopic diffusion in complex liquids utilizing the                     
              method of dynamic imaging of diffusion (DID) - ESR for                         
              measurement of macroscopic translational diffusion and 2D-ELDOR                
              for microscopic translational diffusion; (6) applications of                   
              far-infrared ESR to the study of molecular dynamics.
