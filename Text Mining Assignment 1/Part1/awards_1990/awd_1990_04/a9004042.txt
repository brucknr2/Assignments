Abstract    :
              Our long term goal is to investigate the molecular mechanisms                  
              underlying the genetic control of sexual development in                        
              Drosophila.  Because many of the genes in the sex determination                
              pathway are regulated by RNA processing, these studies will                    
              also contribute to our understanding of alternative RNA                        
              splicing as a means of gene regulation.  Our research is                       
              focused on the sans-fille (snf) gene.  Genetic studies suggest                 
              that snf plays a key role in the sexual decision making process                
              in both the germline and the soma.  To further our                             
              understanding of this newly identified gene we propose: 1) To                  
              determine whether snf is required only for sex determination                   
              or whether it has a more generalized function in development                   
              by analyzing null alleles of the locus. 2) To initiate a                       
              detailed molecular characterization of the snf gene and its                    
              products and 3) To place snf in the regulatory hierarchy of sex                
              determination genes by a combined molecular and genetic                        
              approach.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              In the fruit fly Drosophila individuals with an X and a Y                      
              chromosome develop into males and those with 2X chromosomes                    
              develop into females.  The decision of which developmental                     
              pathway to adopt is made during embryonic life by every cell                   
              in the body of the embryo.  We have known since the early years                
              of this century that the cells make their decision by counting                 
              the number of X chromosomes they contain, but it is only over                  
              the past decade that more  of the details of the mechanism by                  
              which the decision is made have been elucidated.  This is a                    
              proposal to study a recently discovered early step in this                     
              mechanism.
