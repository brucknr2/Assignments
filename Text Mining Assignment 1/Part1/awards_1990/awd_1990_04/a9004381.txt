Abstract    :
               This research is to emplace a 3-component seismometer at depth                
              in the Cajon Pass borehole.  At the 3.5 km depth of the borehole,              
              this is important because this is a zone of seismogenic activity               
              in crystalline rock, and deep sampling of local seismic events                 
              increases our understanding of the components of the P- and S-                 
              wave seismic spectra and the seismic coda in crust undisturbed by              
              near surface phenomena.  If spatial and temporal statistical                   
              properties of earthquake occurrence, for example, b-values and                 
              coda Q, contain important precursory information, the largest and              
              cleanest seismogram sample set is available from sensors placed                
              at depth.  This research is a component of the National                        
              Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
