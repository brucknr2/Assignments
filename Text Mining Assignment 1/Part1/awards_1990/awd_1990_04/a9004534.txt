Abstract    :
                   As slip accrues on a fault, stress concentrates at its ends,              
              which must be relieved by a lengthening of the fault.  This                    
              project will focus on three aspects of this process, the fault                 
              tip processes, the macroscopic fracture criterion that describes               
              it, and the resulting growth process and fault slip/length                     
              scaling relations.  Results are aimed at determining net                       
              geological effects but have a clear impact on earthquake hazard                
              analysis as well.
