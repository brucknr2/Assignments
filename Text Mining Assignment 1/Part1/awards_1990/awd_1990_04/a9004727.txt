Abstract    :
              The objectives of this research are to:                                         
                                                                                            
              1. Design and analyze algorithms with fast average-case time,                  
              simultaneously obtaining speed, simpler algorithms, and developing             
              an analysis of algorithms which matches practice better than the               
              usual emphasis on worst-case time.  Both fine-grained shared                   
              memory, and medium-grained distributed memory, machines will be                
              considered.  This includes work on modeling and implementing                   
              algorithms with a range of local/global tradeoffs, so that such                
              algorithms can be ported to a variety of machines and be easily                
              optimized on each.                                                             
                                                                                             
              2. Determine relationships among various abstract models of concurrent         
              writes, emphasizing models with potential optical implementations.             
                                                                                             
              3. Develop reductions among problems, and develop parallel algorithms          
              in terms of a few standard problems, to simplify portability among             
              architectures.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              4. Develop a distributed-memory machine which matches the performance          
              of shared-memory machines on a variety of geometrical problems.
