Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This newly developed instrument permits imaging of dynamic                     
              microstructural and chemical changes of 'wet' sample materials in              
              their natural state as they occur, without high vacuum.  Housed                
              in the MRL at Penn State it will be available to several groups                
              for the study of chemically bonded ceramics, sol-gels, electronic              
              ceramics, superconductors, diamond films, biological and                       
              composite materials.
