Abstract    :
              The Third International Workshop on Positron and Positronium                   
              Chemistry is to be held at Marquette University in Milwaukee,                  
              Wisconsin, July 16-18, 1990.  The subject area of positron and                 
              positronium chemistry consists of the elucidation of the                       
              chemistry of these two species, and their possible utilization in              
              materials science and engineering.  This workshop will provide a               
              proper forum for addressing fundamental physical-chemical issues               
              that underpin the development and optimization of techniques for               
              materials characterization.  This workshop is being supported                  
              jointly by the Division of Chemistry and the Division of                       
              Materials Research at the National Science Foundation.
