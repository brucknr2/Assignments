Abstract    :
                   The Cordillera Darwin complex in southern Chile exposes high              
              grade metamorphic rocks in close proximity to rocks of                         
              considerably lower grade across the Beagle Canal.  Recent models               
              suggest that the high grade rocks form the core of an extensional              
              "metamorphic core complex" and their exposure was accommodated by              
              large-scale tectonic denudation.  This project is a continuation               
              of a petrographic and age dating effort to test this model by                  
              assembly of PTt paths and radiometric dating techniques.  Data                 
              collected so far are consistent with the proposed structural                   
              models, but are not sufficiently robust or abundant to                         
              unambiguously constrain them.  The purpose of this renewal is to               
              document additional PT paths from both high and low grade                      
              localities and to collect age data to constrain particularly the               
              early cooling history.  Results are expected to place tight                    
              constraints on the pressure (depth), temperature and time                      
              evolution of this area that will allow a thorough test of the                  
              extensional core complex theory.
