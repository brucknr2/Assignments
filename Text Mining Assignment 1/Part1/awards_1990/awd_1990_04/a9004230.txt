Abstract    :
              This project is a component of the World Ocean Circulation                     
              Experiment (WOCE) Volunteer Observing Ship (VOS) program.  Several             
              investigators will participate in a long-term measurement and                  
              analysis project, including the deployment of expendable                       
              temperature (XBT) and conductivity-temperature-depth (XCTD) probes             
              from ships transiting the Pacific.  High resolution sampling and               
              frequent repeats will provide data for the space-time analysis of              
              the upper ocean circulation.
