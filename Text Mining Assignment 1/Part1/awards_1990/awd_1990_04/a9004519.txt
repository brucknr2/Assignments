Abstract    :
                   This project investigates the evolutionary patterns of                    
              gastropod shell biota from subtropical and tropical Miocene to                 
              Recene assemblanges as a function of ecological opportunities and              
              preservational biases created by hermit crabs.                                 
                   PI will study shell bionts associated with a guild of marine              
              hermit crabs, living snails, empty and experimental tethered                   
              shells in two habitats (rocky intertidal and sandflat) in Purerto              
              Penasco, Mexico.                                                               
                   I will identify guilds of bionts associated with each shell               
              inhabitant and formulate criteria by which these shell occupants               
              (snail or hermit crab), and their prospective habitats, can be                 
              recognized in the fossil record.                                               
                   I will then determine, using the fossil record, if these                  
              bionts are (1) recurrent as guilds or change through time as a                 
              result of hermit crabs providing a novel substrate (the empty                  
              gastropod shell), (2) adequate to distingush the evolutionary                  
              history of the hermit crab, and (3) indicative of how much the                 
              gastropod fossil record has been biased by hermit crabs, thus                  
              potentially biasing gastropod paleoecology.  Hermit crabs may                  
              have caused evolutionary breakthroughs in shell biota and this                 
              biota, in turn, may be indicative of the little known fossil                   
              history of hermit crabs and their shell use through time.                      
              Research will address how ecoligcal interactions may have changed              
              through time.
