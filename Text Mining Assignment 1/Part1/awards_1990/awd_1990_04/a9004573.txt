Abstract    :
                   Pure CO2 fluid inclusions commonly occur in metamorphic                   
              rocks which are known to have crystallized in the presence of an               
              H20-rich fluid.  Densities are consistent with peak metamorphic                
              conditions, but their composition is not.  This project will                   
              investigate the possibility that processes attending crystal                   
              plastic flow and dynamic recrystallization of quartz may result                
              in loss of H2O from inclusions, with CO2 remaining in the host                 
              quartz.  Samples of metamorphic rocks showing strain gradients in              
              hand specimen will be utilized to determine the variations of                  
              composition and density of fluid inclusions in relation to                     
              gradients in strain and variations of deformation mechanisms.                  
              Results are expected to clarify origins of pure CO2 inclusions                 
              and may provide a new perspective for studies of high temperature              
              deformation mechanisms.
