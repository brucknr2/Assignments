Abstract    :
                   This proposal constitutes a continuation of studies of                    
              Feng, Gilmore and Vallieres in Research in Nuclear Physics and                 
              Related Topics; namely, (1) The fermion dynamical symmetry                     
              model, (2) Shell model calculations; (3) The baryon-baryon                     
              interaction; and (4) "quantum chaos" and non-linear dynamics.
