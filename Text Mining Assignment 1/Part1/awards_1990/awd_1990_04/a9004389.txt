Abstract    :
              The P.I.s plan further development of the Be-B systematics and                 
              correlation of these tracers with selected trace element ratios                
              and radiogenic isotope compositions for lavas from the Central                 
              America, ANdes, Bismarck, Kurile-Kamchatka, Aleutian, Aeolian,                 
              Trans-Mexico, Lesser Antilles and Mariana volcanic arcs.  These                
              studies are intended to elucidate 1) the nature of crust, mantle               
              and subducted reservoirs, 2) the process by which these                        
              reservoirs interact, and 3) the effects of subduction recycling                
              on geochemical budgets in the crust and mantle.  10Be                          
              measurements will be made at the University of Pennsylvania, with              
              chemical separations made at DTM. K, Rb, Cs, Ba, Sr, U, Th and Pb              
              measurements by isotope dilution and radiogenic isotope                        
              determinations will be made at DTM, along with Be, Li and some B               
              concentration measurements.  Determinations of high field                      
              strength elements, rare earth elements and the majority of B                   
              concentration measurements will be handled through Rice                        
              University.  ICP major and trace element characterizations will                
              be carried out at DTM and Rice.
