Abstract    :
              This research is to use long-period body wave data to resolve                  
              both spherical and aspherical structure in the mantle.  The                    
              analyses will use differential travel time measurements to                     
              constrain large-scale mantle heterogeneity, stacking techniques                
              to image upper mantle discontinuity phases, and synthetic                      
              seismogram modeling of waveforms from selected high-quality                    
              events.
