Abstract    :
              In may 1989, during NSF-sponsored investigations of the xenolith-              
              bearing basanites of central Mexico, Luhr, graduate student Greg               
              Pool, and our Mexican colleague Jorge Aranda-Gomez visited two of              
              the principal localities of lower-crustal xenoliths in central                 
              Mexico.  Each vent was investigated in detail with regard to the               
              spatial abundance of crustal and mantle xenoliths, and attempts                
              were made to quantify the relative abundances of xenolith types                
              in outcrop based on hand-sample observations.  Aranda-Gomez will               
              continue with this statistical work in a petrographic study at                 
              the Mexican National University using thin sections from small                 
              fragments of 50-60 representative crustal xenoliths.  This                     
              project constitutes the A.M. thesis topic of Greg Pool.  Funds                 
              from this grant will support him for the fall semester as he                   
              completes his thesis.  Funds provided by this grant will provide               
              additional trace element analyses by instrumental neutron                      
              activation.  U-Pb geochronological investigations will                         
              concentrate on zircons in several orthogneiss xenoliths from each              
              vent.
