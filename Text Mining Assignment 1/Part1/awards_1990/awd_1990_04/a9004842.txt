Abstract    :
              An experimental investigation of amphibole decomposition reaction              
              rates is proposed which should yield estimates of magma ascent                 
              rates for many andesite, dacite and rhyolite magmas.  Ascent rate              
              estimates are used in conjunction with experimentally determined               
              pre-eruption magma chamber conditions (P,T, fH2O)) to constrain                
              models of eruption dynamics.  Reactions to be studied are (1)                  
              decomposition of amphibole by reaction with melt to form                       
              pyroxenes, plagioclase, Fe-Ti oxides and a more evolved melt, and              
              (2) associated plagioclase crystallization.  Preliminary studies               
              of natural tephra and dome rock samples indicate that these                    
              reactions have proceeded to different degrees in Mount St.                     
              Helens and long Valley caldera eruption products.  The extent of               
              reaction is indicated by measurements of the widths of amphibole               
              breakdown rims, and by changes in plagioclase and melt                         
              composition.  The extent of reaction is primarily a function of                
              decompression (decreasing fH2O) at roughly constant temperature,               
              judging from oxide geothermometry of recent Mount St. Helens                   
              dacite eruption products (1980-1986).  Extent of reaction, as                  
              measured by amphibole breakdown rim width and plagioclase                      
              crystallization, will be experimentally calibrated as a function               
              of decompression rate.  Primary objectives of the research are                 
              (1) to estimate magma ascent rates for well-studied tephra and                 
              dome eruptions of Mount St. Helens and Long Valley caldera, and                
              (2) to compare the ascent rate estimates with those derived from               
              (a) crystal size distribution analysis and (b) earthquake focus                
              migration analysis.
