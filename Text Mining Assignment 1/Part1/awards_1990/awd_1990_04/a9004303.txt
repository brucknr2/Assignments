Abstract    :
                   Field mapping studies will be used to evaluate and apply the              
              critical wedge model of thrust sheet mechanics in an attempt to                
              resolve existing conflicts between thrust sequences predicted by               
              the model and those suggested by geological evidence.  According               
              to the critical wedge model, the advance of the thrust belt under              
              the force of horizontal compression, requires that the wedge                   
              deform internally to attain and maintain a critical taper angle.               
              Potential taper-building mechanisms are:  out-of-sequence                      
              thrusting; duplex formation; and synchronous thrusting.  Field                 
              work began in 1988 and 1989 in the Sawtooth Range of the                       
              northwest Montana thrust belt during a previous award entitled                 
              "Sequence of Thrusting:  Implications for Mechanical Models of                 
              Thrust Belts".  Existing geological maps proved to be inaccurate               
              or inadequate for the purpose of detailed structural analysis and              
              the area had to be remapped.  Two additional field seasons will                
              be required to completed the mapping phase.  The construction of               
              regional cross-sections, sequential restoration of the sections,               
              and forward modelling, will answer two principal questions:  (1)               
              which of the taper-building mechanisms were operative?  and (2)                
              have they occurred in sufficient magnitude to have allowed the                 
              critical wedge model to function?
