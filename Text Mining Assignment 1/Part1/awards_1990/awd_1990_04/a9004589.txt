Abstract    :
                   This project will synthesize the global record of                         
              zoogeographic and paleoenvironmental distribution of Late                      
              Ordovician to Middle Silurian brachiopods.  The effects of the                 
              massive Ordovician-Silurian extinction event on zoogeography and               
              paleoecology will be traced in order to examine rates of recovery              
              and reorganization.  Preliminary results indicating that wide                  
              distribution of brachiopods promoted survival during the                       
              extinction will be examined more closely, and the pattern will be              
              examined to see whether or not it holds in each of six                         
              paleoenvironmental zones arrayed from shallow to deep                          
              environments.  Construction of time-environment diagrams will                  
              permit detailed examination of the evolutionary history and                    
              environmental distribution of brachiopod groups.
