Abstract    :
              Models of the long-term, global carbon cycle have lacked a                     
              geographic dimension; model input and output have been restricted              
              to global-mean values.  Climate change on million-year time scales             
              can be driven by redistribution of the continents and their                    
              weathering lithologies (as this affects atmospheric pCO2).  This               
              project will explore the nature of Phanerozoic climate change by               
              performing several new climate simulations.  Runs at different                 
              pCO2's for the same time periods will elucidate the relationship               
              between global temperature and runoff (the two most important                  
              variables affecting chemical weathering rates and thus pCO2).                  
              These climate variables will then be used in calculations of global            
              weathering rates, using paleogeologic maps prepared during our                 
              previous research.  In addition, two other important factors,                  
              topography (relief) and biological enhancement of chemical                     
              weathering rates, will be assessed, using present-day observations             
              of their affect on soil and stream chemistry, and by assembling and            
              reconstructing paleophytogeographies.  The goal of this research               
              is to create a realistic, coupled model of climate and                         
              biogeochemical cycles that can be used to investigate the                      
              geographic and temporal variability of Phanerozoic climate.
