Abstract    :
              Will generate a new set of detailed stable isotopic, structural,               
              petrochemical, and petrographic data in order to characterize as               
              quantitatively as possible, the fluid flow and mass                            
              transfer/alteration, and their timing in relation to the cooling               
              history of the Cuillin Complex.  It is now increasingly accepted               
              in the Cuillin Complex consists of multiple concentric intrusions              
              separated by significant time gaps.  The resulting complex                     
              thermal history and recent isotopic studies (Farver and Giletti,               
              1989; Ito et al., 1986) suggest the occurrence of two (or more)                
              phases of fluid flow.  Studies of large intrusions elsewhere                   
              (e.g., Bird et al., 1986, 1988) have documented the importance of              
              fluid flow through fractures leading to hydrothermal alteration                
              of the plutons.  Forester and Taylor (1977) suggested an                       
              extensive, penetrative style of fluid flow in the Cuillin                      
              Complex, but the results of Ito et al. (1986) suggest that                     
              fractures may have been important in channeling the fluid flow                 
              within the complex.  The Cuillin Complex, with its exceptional                 
              exposure and a significant body of accumulated high quality data,              
              is an ideal setting in which to clarify the relationships among                
              the nature of hydrothermal alteration, fluid flow, mass transfer,              
              and their timing in relation to the cooling history.
