Abstract    :
                   This award provides one-half of the funding needed to                     
              upgrade an X-ray diffractometer used by the Department of Geology              
              at the University of Illinois. The University is committed to                  
              providing the remaining funds needed.                                          
                   The improved x-ray diffraction system will be used by                     
              several research programs that need to identify the mineralogy of              
              sedimentary rocks, which typically exhibit X-ray diffraction                   
              patterns with numerous and broad overlapping peaks. The                        
              instrument upgrade includes incident beam slits for better                     
              resolution and the automation hardware and software for                        
              diffraction profile fitting procedures (Rietveld refinement) that              
              will allow  accurate determination of diffraction peak                         
              intensities, positions and shapes. Current projects that will                  
              make immediate use of the improved capabilities include research               
              on the origin of coal, carbonate diagenesis, paleoceanography,                 
              and the mechanism of mineral-water interactions.
