Abstract    :
              This project consists of testing a model; the model includes                   
              results and techniques from rock mechanics, chemistry and                      
              numerical analysis and constitutes a new direction in theoretical              
              geochemistry.  It deals with alternating bedding features in                   
              argillaceous carbonate rocks that have either formed from                      
              unbedded argillaceous limestones or have had initial layering                  
              very strongly enhanced by deformation.   Excellent observational               
              data are available on natural rocks for comparison with the                    
              results of the model.  A succesful model would greatly improve                 
              our ability to understand what textural changes a rock may                     
              undergo due to deformation.
