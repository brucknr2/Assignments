Abstract    :
              This proposal aims to characterize the constitutive isoform of                 
              nitrate reductase that is present in soybeans and uses either                  
              NADH or NADPH as reductant.  Monoclonal antibodies will be                     
              generated and used to study epitopes of this isoform and also                  
              used to purify large quantities of this isoform by immunoaffinity              
              chromatography.  The protein will then be characterized                        
              biochemically, and a cDNA clone will be prepared by screening a                
              lambda gt11 library.                                                           
                                                                                             
              Nitrogen is the mineral nutrient that most often limits the                    
              growth of agricultural crops.  In well aerated soils, fertilizer               
              nitrogen is mostly present in the form of nitrate, which the                   
              plants must internally convert to ammonia before the nitrogen can              
              be used to produce the compounds that make up plant proteins.                  
              The enzyme nitrate reductase initiates this conversion, and in                 
              soybean there are three different forms of the enzyme present.                 
              The new work to be carried out in Dr. John Smarrelli's laboratory              
              provides fundamental information about the properties of one                   
              specific form of this enzyme.  Successful completion of this                   
              approach can be expected to provide insights that will ultimately              
              assist in increasing the efficiency of the process of nitrate                  
              utiliztion by plants.
