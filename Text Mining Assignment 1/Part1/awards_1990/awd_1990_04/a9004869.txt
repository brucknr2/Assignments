Abstract    :
              The proposed research addresses forward and inverse position                   
              kinematics of mechanical configurations comprising combinations                
              of both serial and parallel chain segments.  The intent is to lay              
              the foundations of a general theory which will address issues of               
              controllability and complexity of coordination computations.                   
              This research covers a broad class of mechanisms which includes                
              systems as diverse as autonomous planetary rover vehicles and                  
              flexible manufacturing systems.  The study addresses the                       
              implications of different ways of combining serial and parallel                
              substructures for the direct and inverse position and rate                     
              kinematics of these mechanism, and for the associated force                    
              decomposition characteristics.  Many examples of such mechanisms               
              have already been developed and include the multi-fingered hand                
              with multiple independently actuated joints in each finger, a                  
              parallel mechanism in an overall sense, but with each limb                     
              comprising a serial chain with several actuated joints connected               
              in series.  Some study of combined serial and parallel mechanisms              
              has occurred, but the topic is clearly in need of expanded                     
              research to provide for a comprehensive theory.  The theory                    
              should allow designers to make use of combination structures in a              
              manner which will provide improved performance over either purely              
              serial or purely parallel architectures.
