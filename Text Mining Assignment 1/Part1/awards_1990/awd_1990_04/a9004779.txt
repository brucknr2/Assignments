Abstract    :
                   Knowledge of the rates of strike-slip motion along plate                  
              boundary faults is important to late Cenozoic tectonism and to                 
              earthquake hazard reduction efforts.  This project addresses the               
              Septentrional fault zone in the Dominican Republic which is the                
              active, on shore extension of the North American- Caribbean plate              
              boundary.  The work will focus on fault trenching at three                     
              Quaternary fault scarps combined with radiocarbon age dating.                  
              These data are expected to date the ages of past earthquakes                   
              along the fault and directly determine geologic slip rates.                    
              These results can be used to test conflicting plate motion models              
              and can be integrated into ongoing marine geophysical survey and               
              GPS experiments along the plate boundary.
