Abstract    :
                This research is to study the detailed P- and S-wave velocity                
              crust and upper mantle structures under Tibet along a nearly N-S               
              profile across the Plateau.  In cooperation with the Institute of              
              Geophysics, State Seismological Bureau of the Peoples' Republic                
              of China, the deployment of 10 or more PASSCAL seismic systems                 
              for 12 months will be done recording teleseisms, regional events               
              in central and eastern Asia, and local seismicity in the Tibetan               
              Plateau.  The Tibetan Plateau is a first order topographic                     
              feature on Earth; it represents an "end member" in the global                  
              tectonics in terms of the intensity of collisional tectonics.                  
              This cooperative research program between the U.S. and Chinese                 
              scientists will involve equal sharing of funding and data.  This               
              research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard                      
              Reduction Program.
