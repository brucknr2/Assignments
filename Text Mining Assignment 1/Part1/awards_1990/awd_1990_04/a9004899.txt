Abstract    :
                   The purpose is to carry out high precision calculations on                
              the Li isoelectronic series for Z < 10. A number of quantities                 
              will be calculated including the energy levels, mass shift,                    
              transition isotope shift, hyperfine coupling constant, electron                
              density at the nucleus and relativistic contributions. In                      
              particular, a high precision lower bound for the nonrelativistic               
              ground state energy of the Li atom will be computed.  This should              
              resolve an issue in the literature concerning the precise                      
              location of the ground state energy of Li to a 1 microhartree                  
              level of accuracy (.00003 eV).  The lower bound will also provide              
              valuable information on the rate of convergence of the                         
              variational approach used. Finally, an indirect determination of               
              the Lamb shifts for particular states of the Li I series will be               
              carried out.  Lamb shifts for selected spectral transitions will               
              also be evaluated.
