Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Water column properties (temperature, salinity, nutrients) will be             
              sampled every 30 nautical miles along hydrographic line P14C in the            
              southwest Pacific (between New Zealand and Fiji) as part of the                
              World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) hydrographic program in              
              the Pacific ocean. The relative velocity profiles calculated from              
              the density profiles will be combined with other observation in the            
              region to obtain absolute velocities and mass transport.
