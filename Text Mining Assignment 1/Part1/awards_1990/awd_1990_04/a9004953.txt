Abstract    :
              The Late-Cenozoic Baikal Rift lies astride a suture between the                
              Archean Siberian Craton and a southerly belt of younger accreted               
              terranes.  Basic magmas ranging from hypersthene-normative                     
              basalts to strongly nepheline-normative basanites have erupted                 
              across the southern end of the Baikal Rift since the Ogliocene,                
              carrying fragments of the underlying mantle to the surface.  This              
              is a program of geochemical and petrologic research aimed at                   
              evaluating temporal and spatial variations in these mafic magmas               
              and their mantle xenoliths.  It will integrate isotopic, whole-                
              rock major and trace element, and mineral chemistry data from                  
              basalts and xenoliths collected along a 550-km-long transect                   
              across the southern Baikal Rift.  The transect extends from                    
              Proterozoic-Paleozoic lithosphere in the southeast across the                  
              suture onto the Archean craton in the northwest.  This study will              
              constitute one of the first of its kind from northern central                  
              Asia.
