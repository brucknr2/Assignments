Abstract    :
                   The Blue Ridge-Piedmont thrust sheet of the southern                      
              Appalachians is a "type example" of a composite thrust sheet                   
              produced by several events, yet the emplacement history, and its               
              relationship to metamorphism and ages of plutonism are not well                
              constrained.  This project will investigate a relatively well-                 
              exposed area- the Columbus Promontory- in order to address                     
              emplacement mechanics and physical conditions of fault                         
              development on several scales.  Field mapping, fabric data,                    
              radiometric age data of plutons and fault rocks, and                           
              geothermobarometric data will be collected and employed in an                  
              effort to constrain these large structures and discern their                   
              evolution.
