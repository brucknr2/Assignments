Abstract    :
                   The Sao Francisco craton region, one of two cratonic areas                
              in Brazil initially formed in the Archean as part of a much                    
              larger crustal block.  Subsequent tectonic activity has reduced                
              the area to a relatively small remnant.  In the southern Sao                   
              Francisco region of Minas Gerais, Brazil a relatively complete                 
              and reasonably exposed record of Proterozoic activity exists.                  
              This project will, with the close cooperation of geologists from               
              the Universidade Federal de Ouro Preto, assemble detailed                      
              transects across this margin and conduct radiometric age                       
              determinations in an attempt to identify the tectonic style and                
              ages of the precambrian tectonic events affecting the Sao                      
              Francisco craton of eastern Brazil.
