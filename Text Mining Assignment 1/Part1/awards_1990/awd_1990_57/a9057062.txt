Abstract    :
              The principal focus of this project is the                                     
              development of computational schemes and                                       
              algorithms for the real- time simulation of                                    
              complex multibody systems on                                                   
              multiprocessor computing systems.  The                                         
              results of this project may have a direct                                      
              impact on the design, simulation and                                           
              control of large multisegment, multi-                                          
              joint structures as well as the design of                                      
              software for the newly-emerging                                                
              multi-processing hardware.  The                                                
              project utilizes graph theory and                                              
              operations research methods to investigate                                     
              inherent parallelisms in computational                                         
              schemes and their suitability for                                              
              execution on multiprocessing systems.                                          
              Automated symbolic algebra packages are                                        
              employed to generate novel theoretical                                         
              formulations for describing the dynamics of                                    
              complex multibody systems which incorporate                                    
              rigid and flexible bodies.  The work is                                        
              fundamental in nature and is applicable of                                     
              problems in other scientific and                                               
              engineering disciplines, in particular the                                     
              study of motor control is biosystems
