Abstract    :
              The effective thermal treatment of solid waste materials                       
              requires an understanding of the physical and chemical                         
              phenomena which interact in a variety of combustion                            
              environments.  The objective of this research program is to                    
              define the rate controlling steps and the heat and mass                        
              transfer limitations to advanced incineration designs and to                   
              increased efficiency for existing systems.  The desorption of                  
              naphthalene and pyrene for soils will be studied in particle                   
              and bed characterization reactors, and in a rotary kiln                        
              simulator.  A circulating fluidized bed combustor will be                      
              constructed to complement the reactor studies.  The relation                   
              between the operating temperature, gas environment, and the                    
              fate of metals in incinerators will be investigated using                      
              GC/MS, ICP, and ESCA analytical techniques.  Computer                          
              simulation of the various reactors will compliment the                         
              experimental work.                                                             
                                                                                             
              The problem of organic and inorganic hazardous waste disposal                  
              has become critical to the public and to the industrial                        
              organizations responsible for their management.  A systematic                  
              study of various aspects of hazards elimination through                        
              combustion processes is essential to the development of a safe                 
              technology for waste treatment.
