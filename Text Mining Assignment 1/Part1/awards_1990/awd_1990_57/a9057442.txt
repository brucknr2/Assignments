Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              For this PYI award, research will be conducted in two related                  
              areas of condensed matter theory: (1) the use of first-principles              
              methods for the theoretical prediction of the structural and                   
              electronic properties of solids, particularly the innovative                   
              application of these techniques combined with results from                     
              statistical mechanics, and (2) the investigation of the                        
              interrelationships of chemistry, structure and properties of                   
              complex crystals through models with a small number of parameters              
              having microscopic significance.  Such models can then be used                 
              for the direct interpretation of experimental results, as well as              
              for analysis through first-principles calculations.
