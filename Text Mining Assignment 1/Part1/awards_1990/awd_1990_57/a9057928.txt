Abstract    :
              This Presidential Young Investigator Award will support Dr.                    
              Huttenlocher's research in model-based object recognition.                     
              Robotic recognition in complex scenes tends to be slow and of                  
              uncertain reliability.  Dr. Huttenlocher has been developing                   
              methods that are efficient and accurate, with predictable or                   
              controllable error probabilities.  He will extend his                          
              characterization of Hough-based methods to interpretation-tree                 
              search and other object-recognition approaches, and plans to                   
              develop new algorithms using techniques of computational                       
              geometry.  These perceptual capabilities will be used in a                     
              robotic planning and assembly system being developed jointly with              
              Dr. Bruce Donald.
