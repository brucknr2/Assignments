Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Transmitter receptors exist as multiple receptor subtypes with                 
              different binding affinities and different cellular and                        
              physiological responses to the same transmitter.  The expression               
              and sensitivity of these receptor subtypes can be independently                
              regulated.  Such multiplicity of receptor subtypes enables a                   
              single transmitter to play a variety of physiological roles in                 
              the same tissue.  The investigator is employing molecular                      
              genetic, biochemical and electrophysiological methods to analyze               
              and manipulate cloned serotonin receptor genes to determine how                
              these receptors bind specific ligands and interact with other                  
              cellular proteins.  This award will enable the investigator to                 
              isolate novel serotonin receptors and to characterize the                      
              cellular responses they elicit as well as to determine which                   
              cells in the rat brain express them.  In addition, the regions of              
              serotonin receptors responsible for ligand binding,                            
              ligand.induced conformational changes in receptor structure, and               
              G protein interaction will be determined using mutational                      
              techniques.  Differences in the second messenger systems                       
              activated by different serotonin receptor subtypes will also be                
              explored.
