Abstract    :
                   The goals of the assembly-level computer aided design project             
              are :  (1) to provide an interactive design environment that                   
              supports conceptual design as well as shape description and, (2)               
              generate design models that more effectively support automated                 
              design optimization and production planning tools.                             
                   A functional computer aided design system in an actual design             
              environment should be the result of this research.
