Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              With a Presidential Young Investigator award from the                          
              National Science Foundation, Dr. Chris Doe will continue his work              
              on the development of the nervous system in the fruitfly,                      
              Drosophila. Dr. Doe has already been involved in ground                      
              breaking work on the molecular mechanisms controlling the                      
              determination and interactions of developing neurons.  The                    
              proposed research aims to discover and study genes that control                
              the unique biochemical and morphological characteristics of                    
              specific identified neurons. Drosophila is the ideal species with              
              which to do this kind of study because it is amenable to                       
              sophisticated genetic/molecularstrategies that allow the rapid                 
              isolation and sequencing ofimportant genes.  In addition, Dr.                  
              Doe's background makes it certain that he will be able to                      
              successfully carry out such a program.  It is now becoming clear               
              that developmental control genes characterized in Drosophila have              
              homologous relatives with similar functions in vertebrates.                    
              Thus, the genes discovered by Dr. Doe will have important                      
              implications for general developmental control mechanisms.  This              
              award will facilitate the establishment of a very promising                    
              research program by a gifted and dedicated young scientist.
