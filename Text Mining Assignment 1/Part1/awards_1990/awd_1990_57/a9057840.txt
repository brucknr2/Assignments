Abstract    :
              This Presidential Young Investigator Award given in the Organic                
              and Macromolecular Chemistry Program provides support for the                  
              work of Dr. Banita White Brown at the University of                            
              North Carolina at Charlotte.  This work is focused on                          
              nitrogen-pivot lariat ethers which possess one or more sidearms                
              appended to the nitrogen atom(s) of a macrocyclic azacrown                     
              ether.  These lariat ethers will be evaluated for efficacy as                  
              mimics of naturally occurring ionophores.                                      
                                                                                             
              The goal of this research program is to synthesize several                     
              peptide derivatives of one- and two-armed nitrogen-pivot lariat                
              ethers in order to evaluate calcium(II) binding constants using                
              circular dichroism measurements and to characterize the                        
              sequence of binding.
