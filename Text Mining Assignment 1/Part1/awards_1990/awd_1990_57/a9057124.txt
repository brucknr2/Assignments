Abstract    :
                   The Presidential Young Investigator will continue working on              
              several problems in the general area of fluid transport.  The                  
              first area involves the study of fluid stability;  in particular,              
              Bayly will try to extend results on broadband instability from                 
              two dimensions to three dimensions.  The goal of this research is              
              to develop a global picture of instability modes and hence, a                  
              coherent picture of broadband instabilities in general flows.                  
              The second area involves the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) dynamo                  
              problem;  in particular, the investigator and a colleague at NYU               
              will try to discover what is needed to produce a fast dynamo.                  
              Their strategy is to perform high-resolution MHD simulations of                
              dynamo actions and establish rigorous error bounds on the                      
              numerical discretizations.                                                     
                   Various types of fluid dynamical phenomena involve the                    
              creation and evolution of instabilities.  An instability is                    
              produced when a small or large perturbation upsets an existing                 
              balance of forces and leads to the formation of a new equilibrium              
              state, which in turn might itself change in response to new                    
              perturbations.  It is easy to imagine that one is interested in                
              such changes in equilibrium states, since the design of apparatus              
              depends crucially upon what the prevailing equilibrium state is                
              thought to be in a given flow situation.  The investigator will                
              use analytical and computational tools to describe the evolution               
              of broadband instabilities in complex flows and the impact of                  
              relatively large disturbances.
