Abstract    :
                   This Presidential Young Investigator Award supports the                   
              research of Professor John Stembridge of the University of                     
              Michigan. Dr. Stembridge's research plan involves the                          
              relationship between algebraic combinatorics and the theory of                 
              group representations, as well as other studies that bring the                 
              techniques of combinatorics to bear on problems in more distant                
              branches of mathematics.                                                       
                   This research falls in the broad category of combinatorics,               
              which is one of the most active fields in today's mathematics.                 
              Fundamentally, combinatorics represents a systematization of the               
              very first of all mathematical activities, counting. In its                    
              modern development, however, combinatorics has gone beyond just                
              counting to make use of a wide variety of advanced mathematical                
              techniques, and although its roots go back several centuries, the              
              field has had an explosive development in the past few decades                 
              because of its importance in communications and information                    
              technology.
