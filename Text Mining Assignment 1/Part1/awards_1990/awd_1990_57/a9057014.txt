Abstract    :
                   The PI intends to continue research into the evolution of                 
              complex fault systems.  Prime field site is the San Andreas fault              
              at two very different physical and temporal scales.  During                    
              faulting, evolution in the structural style, and the magnitude of              
              nonbrittle deformation associated with each earthquake, changes                
              to reflect the control exerted by growth of the fault surface                  
              into unfaulted strata, and the geometry of the older deformed                  
              strata.                                                                        
                   On a regional scale, mapping, structural analysis and                     
              paleomagnetic studies are coupled to provide an understanding of               
              how transtensive and transpressive systems change with time, and               
              how the earliest geometry exerts control on the distribution of                
              stress orientation and structural styles.
