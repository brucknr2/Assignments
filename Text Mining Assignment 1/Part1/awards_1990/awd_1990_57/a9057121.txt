Abstract    :
                   Plasma wave and particle interactions are fundamental to                  
              the study of plasmas and plasma turbulence.  The self-                         
              consistent action of chaotic particles on mean-field plasma                    
              waves and on plasma wave-wave interactions will be explored.                   
              Laboratory experiments will be devised using laser diagnosis of                
              plasma ion wave-particle and wave-wave interactions to study                   
              this problem.  The experiments require the development of more                 
              sophisticated laser diagnostics to probe these interactions.                   
              An important goal of the research will be to search for a                      
              simple means of approaching these complex phenomena.  The                      
              ultimate goal is to provide experimental tests which will guide                
              and compliment theoretical studies of the role of chaos in                     
              plasma wave-wave and wave-particle interactions.
