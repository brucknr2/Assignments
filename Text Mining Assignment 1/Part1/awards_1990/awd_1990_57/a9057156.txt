Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Research in theoretical condensed matter physics will be                       
              conducted on the relation between multifractal and random walk                 
              methods arising in the physics of diffusion-limited aggregation                
              and physical problems in electrochemistry.  Two problems, pattern              
              formation in electrodeposition, and the frequency dependence of                
              the double layer impedance at a rough surface, may be treated                  
              using random walk algorithms closely related to those used in                  
              diffusion-limited aggregation.  Other areas of research will                   
              include heterogeneous catalysis, corrosion, electro-rheological                
              fluids and disordered superconductors.
