Abstract    :
              A computer code is to be constructed to simulate three-                        
              dimensional unsteady turbulent reactive flows, based upon a                    
              spectral element algorithm which combines the accuracy of                      
              pseudospectral methods with the versatility of finite-element                  
              techniques.  The large eddy simulation technique will be used,                 
              in which the subgrid turbulent motion is modeled approximately                 
              while the large scale structures  are calculated directly.  A                  
              single-point probability density function method will be                       
              developed for the scalar subgrid closure, and a two-equation                   
              subgrid model will be employed for the hydrodynamic closure.                   
              In a second program, the effects of compressibility on hyper-                  
              velocity three-dimensional reacting turbulent flows will be                    
              investigated using a hybrid finite difference/element                          
              pseudospectral algorithm.  Several recently developed shock                    
              capturing schemes will be implemented for high Mach number                     
              flow simulations.                                                              
                                                                                             
              The thorough understanding of turbulent reactive flows is                      
              essential to operate modern engines and power systems within                   
              the constraints of high efficiency and low emissions, and the                  
              next generation of supersonic aircraft poses questions which                   
              may not be answerable through traditional experimentation and                  
              development techniques.  This research program will provide                    
              new tools for engineers to extract answers to many of those                    
              questions.
