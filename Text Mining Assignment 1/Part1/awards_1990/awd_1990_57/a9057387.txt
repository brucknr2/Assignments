Abstract    :
              This is an award to provide support for research to be                         
              initiated by this Presidential Young Investigator who was                      
              nominated under conditions contained in the Program                            
              Announcement NSF 89-58. The broad goals of this                                
              investigator's research involve the interactions of                            
              organic and particulate matter with surfaces of membranes                      
              that are used for treatment of water and wastewater,  and                      
              on the effects that mixing conditions have on flocculation                     
              of precipates produced by use of chemical coagulants in                        
              water and wastewater treatment processes.                                      
                                                                                             
              Results of this research are likely to be utilized in                          
              engineering design of processes and systems for removal of                     
              contaminants from municipal and industrial water supplies                      
              and in treatment of wastewater prior to discharge into the                     
              environment.
