Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This Presidential Young Investigator Award concentrates on                     
              research on wide bandgap semiconductor materials, such as                      
              diamond, silicon carbide, and boron nitride.  THe materials are                
              being synthesized using microwave plasma enhanced chemical vapor               
              deposition, oxyacetylene flame deposition, and heated filament                 
              deposition.  The emphasis in the synthesis studies is film                     
              surface morphology and film adhesion to the substrate.  Adhesion               
              studies involve surface characterization and interface                         
              modification by ion beam damage and in-situ cleaning.                          
              Characterization techniques include Auger spectroscopy, x-ray                  
              photoelectron spectroscopy, ultraviolet photoemission and                      
              inverse photoemission spectroscopy, and electron diffraction.
