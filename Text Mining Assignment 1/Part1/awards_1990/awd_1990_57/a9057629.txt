Abstract    :
              This Presidential Young Investigator Award is made to promote                  
              research in the nature of the residual stresses that can exist in              
              specific bodies.  Residual stresses exist in all manufactured parts            
              and many natural ones.  However they are normally ignored in stress            
              analysis studies and they should be considered.
