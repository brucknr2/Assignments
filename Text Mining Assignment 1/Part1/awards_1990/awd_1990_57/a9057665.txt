Abstract    :
                   Research concerns the design and analysis of algorithms for               
              discrete optimization problems, and the study of discrete                      
              structures in general.  Two areas of special interest are: (1) the             
              study of certain "obstructions", called tangles, to small tree- or             
              path-width, which play a crucial role in the Graph Minors theory;              
              and (2) to investigate a problem of interest in VLSI (very large               
              system integration) chip and communication network switch design,              
              involving the minimum number of edge crossings when drawing a graph            
              in the plane.  There are several open problems concerning crossing             
              numbers, one of the most important being their efficient                       
              approximation (there are no known results, either positive or                  
              negative).  The tools from the theory of arrangements will be                  
              employed.
