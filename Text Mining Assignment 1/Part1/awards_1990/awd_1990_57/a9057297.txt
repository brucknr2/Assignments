Abstract    :
                   Research focuses on developing Brownian approximations of                 
              mathematically intractable dynamic scheduling (or resource                     
              allocation) problems in order to develop effective scheduling                  
              policies for a variety of production systems.  These systems                   
              include multiclass, multistation closed queueing networks (which               
              are perhaps the most prominent mathematical models of                          
              manufacturing, computer, and communication systems), make-to-stock             
              queueing systems (that is, production/inventory systems, where the             
              production system is modeled as a queueing system) with random                 
              yields and substitutable demands (motivated by semiconductor                   
              manufacturing), and multiechelon repairable inventory systems.//
