Abstract    :
                   Industrial computer-aided design and manufacturing packages               
              live in the three-dimensional arena and it is assumed that solid               
              objects are homogeneous and isotropic.  These underlying                       
              assumptions are becoming invalid with the recent developments of               
              new materials such as composite, and emerging manufacturing                    
              technologies such as plasma spray.   Moreover, engineers are                   
              starting to integrate materials in the process of inhomogeneous                
              structure design.  A high-dimensional paradigm in geometric design             
              will be developed to capture, visualize and assist in the design               
              and manufacturing of inhomogeneous structures.  Specific emphasis              
              will be placed on scientific foundations for high-dimensional                  
              geometric representation and manufacturing integration.
