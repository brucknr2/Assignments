Abstract    :
              This research by a Presidential Young Investigator is focused                  
              on a variety of topics involved in fluid mixing and fluid                      
              instabilities.  Work is planned on instabilities in fluidized                  
              beds, interfacial instabilities, mixing in flows with large                    
              density non-uniformities, and mixing in gas flows with the                     
              occurrence of shock waves.                                                     
                                                                                             
              The results will have applicability ranging from processing in                 
              the chemical industry to operation of supersonic combustion                    
              ramjet engines.
