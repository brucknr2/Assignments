Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This PYI Award is for fundamental research on the                              
              processing science of temperature/high performance                             
              composite materials based upon intermetallic alloy, ceramic                    
              and carbon matrices.  One area of interest is novel                            
              processing techniques for the manufactoring of high                            
              temperature structural composites.  Analytical processing                      
              models will be developed to study the complex interaction                      
              of processing variables and to predict the evolution of                        
              microstructure during processing.  Advanced sensing                            
              techniques will monitor and control the processing                             
              variables which determine microstructure, properties, and                      
              the basis for developing intelligent processing                                
              methodologies.  Control of processing parameters so as to                      
              control interface behavior is a key factor, and significant                    
              effort will be devoted to develop a micromechanical model                      
              to correlate the interface properties with composite                           
              behavior.
