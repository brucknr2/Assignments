Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This PYI award will support research on the near-surface                       
              damage introduced into components during finishing                             
              operations and on methods to minimize such damage.                             
              Analytical models for surface deformation and                                  
              microfracturing due to mechanical and thermal stresses in                      
              brittle materials will be developed and validated by                           
              experimental studies.  In addition, the stress state of                        
              fretting fatigue will be evaluated in order to improve the                     
              characterization of this type of damage.
