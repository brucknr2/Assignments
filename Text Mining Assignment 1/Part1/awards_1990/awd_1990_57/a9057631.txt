Abstract    :
              This Presidential Young Investigator Award will support Dr.                    
              Kreutz-Delgado's development of a real-time testbed for sensor-                
              based control of a dual-arm robotic manipulation system.  His                  
              goal is exploration of robotic assembly and servicing principles               
              for flexible manufacturing and for autonomous robotic systems.                 
              His current research, begun at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory,                  
              involves application of a spatial operator algebra to real-time                
              task-level planning and use of neural-network approaches for                   
              manipulator and camera coordination.
