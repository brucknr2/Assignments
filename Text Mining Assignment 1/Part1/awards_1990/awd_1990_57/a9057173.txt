Abstract    :
                   Theoretical research in elementary particle physics will                  
              deal with the symmetry breaking which gives rise to elementary                 
              particle masses, and especially with the possibility that this                 
              symmetry breaking is a result of the physics known as                          
              "Technicolor".  This work will be part of a program which seeks                
              to overcome the technical problems of technicolor and to                       
              determine its experimental consequences.  The research, to be                  
              done by one of the new Presidential Young Investigators for                    
              1990, is an exploration of an important alternative to the                     
              somewhat more straightforward models of mass-generating                        
              symmetry breaking.
