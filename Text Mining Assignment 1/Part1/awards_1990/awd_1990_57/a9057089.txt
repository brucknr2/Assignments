Abstract    :
              This Presidential Young Investigator Award will support research               
              into the earliest era of the Universe.  Using state of the art                 
              detectors in the submillimeter region of the spectrum from the                 
              South Pole, Dr. Dragovan will attempt to measure the degree of                 
              isotropy of the cosmic background radiation, the radiation left                
              from the Big Bang.  By mapping the structure in the intensity of               
              the background radiation, one can then infer the distribution of               
              the mass in the early universe.  This distribution is a key element            
              in various theories of the evolution of the Universe and the                   
              formation of the structures such as clusters of galaxies that                  
              dominate the present day visible mass distribution.
