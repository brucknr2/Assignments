Abstract    :
                   This project represents work performed by a Presidential                  
              Young Investigator on mathematical problems arising in the                     
              theories of partial differential equations and several complex                 
              variables.  In the context of the research these are not separate              
              areas but are connected by fundamental questions relating to                   
              understanding when a differential equation, defined on the                     
              boundary of a domain in a space of several complex variables,                  
              admits a solution.  When this is the case, it follows that the                 
              boundary data extends to a neighborhood of the boundary as an                  
              holomorphic function.  Domains in the space of two complex                     
              variables for which the problem can be solved have been                        
              characterized.  The present work will look at the higher                       
              dimensional cases.  There is reason to believe that a direct                   
              generalization to higher dimensions may not be possible.                       
              Estimates needed in the proof of the two-dimensional result do                 
              not carry over directly.  New metrics recently introduced will                 
              provide good estimates of fundamental solutions of the                         
              differential equations, however the sharpness one needs cannot be              
              obtained.                                                                      
                   In addition to attacking this most pressing problem of the                
              day, work will also be done in using methods developed in                      
              analyzing the partial differential operator on manifolds which                 
              are not necessarily the boundary of a domain in several complex                
              variables.
