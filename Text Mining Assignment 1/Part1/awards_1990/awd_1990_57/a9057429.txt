Abstract    :
                   The Presidential Young Investigator will conduct research in              
              the area of computational fluid dynamics;  in particular, he will              
              study shock diffractions and bifurcations as different shocks                  
              interact with each other and with fluid interfaces and vortex                  
              sheets.  This is very important and timely research, and it is of              
              sufficient complexity that the PI will employ analytical methods               
              from geometry and bifurcation theory, in addition to                           
              computational techniques.  The goals of the research are twofold.              
              The first goal is to discover different types of wave patterns                 
              that result from the complex interactions of shocks and fluid                  
              structures, while the second goal is to develop numerical methods              
              that allow one to follow the evolution in time of the waves                    
              generated by the interactions.                                                 
                   Many phenomena in fluid dynamics arise out of the                         
              interactions of different types of waves with each other and with              
              internal fluid structures such as interfaces.  What makes these                
              interactions difficult to study mathematically is that they are                
              described by systems of nonlinear differential equations, and so               
              one must use computers in order to generate solutions.  But this               
              is tricky also, because computers can often generate meaningless               
              information, unless the numerical methods used are reliable.  The              
              PI will study such problems with "intelligent" numerical methods.              
              These are methods that have sufficient analytical and physical                 
              theory built into them that they produce sharp approximations to               
              the correct physical solutions.
