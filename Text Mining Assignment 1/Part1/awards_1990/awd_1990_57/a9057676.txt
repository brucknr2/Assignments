Abstract    :
              The research supported by the Presidential Young                               
              Investigator Award is the theoretical and experimental                         
              analysis of extrusion of biological materials.  One of the                     
              difficulties in predicting parameters, for instance flow                       
              rate, in extrusion processing is that most biopolymers                         
              undergo chemical reactions during extrusion-cooking.                           
              These chemical reactions significantly change the                              
              rheological behavior of the material.  The objective of                        
              the study is to develop a mathematical model to predict                        
              the interaction of rheological behavior, time-temperature                      
              history and reaction rate.  The experimental studies to                        
              verify the model will utilize magnetic resonance imaging.                      
              Magnetic resonance imaging will provide a quantitative                         
              evaluation of the velocity profile of fluid in the                             
              extruder during operation.
