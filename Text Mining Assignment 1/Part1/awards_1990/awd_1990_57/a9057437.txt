Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project addresses work in several topics, including                       
              the development of techniques to analyze nonlinear                             
              stochastic dynamical systems, and the development of local                     
              and global techniques for understanding bifurcations and                       
              for predicting chaotic dynamics of deterministic systems.                      
              Both analytical and computational issues are addressed.                        
              The primary research goals are: (1) to develop                                 
              computational techniques for understanding large chaotic                       
              multi-degree of freedom mechanical systems, (2) to develop                     
              algorithms for modeling nonlinear distributed systems                          
              (characterized by partial differential equations) by a                         
              finite number of ordinary differential equations, and (3)                      
              to develop symbolic algorithms for performing feedback                         
              linearization and to design nonlinear controllers for the                      
              nonlinear control systems defined on inertial manifolds.
