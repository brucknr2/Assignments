Abstract    :
              Techniques will be developed to prepare and understand the                     
              properties of a new class of molecules:  Fragments of simple                   
              inorganic semiconducting solids comprised of tens to tens of                   
              thousands of atoms, and ranging from 20 to 200 Angstroms in                    
              diameter.  Experimental investigations of the energies and                     
              densities of electronic states, vibrational frequencies,                       
              electron-vibration coupling, surface reconstruction and surface                
              tension will be undertaken, and the foundation for a theory of                 
              large clusters will be provided.
