Abstract    :
              Birmingham         This research focuses on the development of a set of tools 
              to rapidly prototype digital systems taking into account a need  to minimize
              lifetime costs by building testable systems and  including consideration of
              manufacturing issues.  The knowledge-  based synthesis system MICON serves as a
              software workbench.   MICON takes a input high-level functional specifications
              for a  microprocessor-based system and generates a complete design.   More
              specifically, this research focuses on three major topics:  1.     A
              design-for-testability extension (DFT);  2.     A domain-independent version of
              MICON (DIM); and,  3.     An interface to high-level (behavioral) synthesis
              tools.         Research is concentrating on three areas:  heuristic search 
              methods for large-scale optimization, knowledge acquisition  tools, and timing
              verification.
