Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              This PYI award will be used to pursue research into the novel                  
              area of ion implantation induced amorphization and subsequent                  
              solid phase epitaxial growth of compound semiconductors and                    
              heterocompositional compound semiconductor interfaces.  Solid                  
              state diffusion limitations account for observation of both the                
              larger scale growth front instabilities and the small scale (10-               
              15A) discrete aggregative type growth during solid phase epitaxy               
              of GaAs.  These solid phase growth  characteristics represent a                
              departure from the two dimensional Frank van der Merwe type                    
              growth associated with solid phase epitaxial growth of elemental               
              semiconductors.  With a new JEOL 4000FX high resolution the P.I.               
              will TEM with full image processing, study the layer by layer                  
              solid phase epitaxial growth process in situ.
