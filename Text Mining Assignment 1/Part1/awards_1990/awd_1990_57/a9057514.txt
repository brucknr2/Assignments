Abstract    :
              This Presidential Young Investigator Award provides general                    
              research funds for Dr. Werner-Washburne's studies of the                       
              regulatory events that control entry into stationary phase in the              
              yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.  Stationary phase represents                   
              cells' response to starvation through specific physiological and               
              morphological changes as well as the arrest of cell division.                  
              Yeast is an ideal system for this study because it is amenable to              
              both molecular and genetic analyses, and a number of mutants                   
              defective in entry into stationary phase have been isolated.
