Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Thermodynamics and transport properties of liquid-crystalline                  
              mixtures - Theory and Experiment                                               
              Liquid crystals (LC), especially their mixtures, are used                      
              extensively in many technological applications, and in                         
              biological systems their presence is widespread.  Despite                      
              their importance, an understanding of their thermodynamics and                 
              transport properties is very poor, especially at the                           
              microscopic level.  In this research the PI will use                           
              statistical mechanical theories (both the composition-space                    
              DFT as well as the traditional configuration-space DFT),                       
              molecular simulation, and experiment to study the dynamics and                 
              thermodynamic behavior of LC substances in the presence of                     
              various types of solutes.  These studies are designed to                       
              satisfy several goals, including:  (1) to explore the limits                   
              of both types of DFT; (2) to produce a comprehensive set of                    
              experimental data on the behavior of LC mixtures; (3) to                       
              validate some model potentials through comparison with the                     
              experimental data; and (4) to provide a molecular-level                        
              understanding of the behavior of LC mixtures to a degree which                 
              cannot be achieved by any other means.
