Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research is associated with a Presidential Young                          
              Investigator Award, and is concerned with obtaining tools                      
              which are useful in the analysis and control of systems                        
              containing significant uncertainty.  These uncertainties                       
              are characterized deterministically, rather than                               
              stochastically.  The systems treated can be linear or                          
              nonlinear and analyzed by either continuous time or                            
              discrete time methods.  The major application of the                           
              research is in the analysis and control of aerospace and                       
              mechanical systems.  Specific directions in this research                      
              will consider the following situations, (1) the                                
              uncertainties satisfy less restrictive structural                              
              conditions than presently assumed, (2) the complete state                      
              of the system is not available for feedback, (3) there are                     
              delays in state measurement or control application, (4)                        
              there are uncertainties in the dynamic order of the system,                    
              and (5) the system is infinite dimensional in character.
