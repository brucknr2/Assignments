Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Dr. Zamer wants to continue studying the genetic basis of physiological        
              phenomenon and their expression in varied environment.  He wishes to           
              examine the mechanisms by which natural selection leads to differential        
              reproductive success as a key issue in evolutionary biology.                   
                                                                                             
              In order to examine how the extent to which genetic variation affects          
              physiological performance, Dr. Zamer will study both the organismal and        
              metabolic and organismal levels of physiological performance.  He will         
              qualify genetic components of total variation for several metabolic and        
              organismal level physiological characteristics underlying genetically          
              identical sea anemones under a variety of relevant environmental               
              conditions.  This research is an important contribution to marine              
              biology and will enhance our understanding of the influence that               
              genetic variation has on reorganization of metabolism during                   
              environmental change.
