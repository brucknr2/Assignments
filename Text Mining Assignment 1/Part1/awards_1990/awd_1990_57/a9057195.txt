Abstract    :
              The goal of this research is to understand the role of molecular               
              and microstructural dynamics in determing the macroscopic                      
              material properties of polymers.  In the case of polymeric                     
              liquids, they are combining experimental and theoretical                       
              approaches in order to advance our ability to predict their                    
              rheological properties.  Due to the complex nature of these                    
              fluids, and in order to obtain appropriate information to test                 
              theory, it is necessary to observe the dynamics of individual                  
              components in multicomponent systems and to follow specific modes              
              of relaxation in response to macroscopic deformation.  To access               
              this level of information, this research will be developing                    
              combined spectroscopic and rheometric methods to study the                     
              order-disorder transition in block copolymers, the rheology of                 
              miscible polymer melts, and the orientational order of rigid-rod               
              polymer liquid crystals under flow.                                            
                                                                                             
              Molecular motions play an important role in solid polymers as                  
              well, and one aspect is the onset of mobility that is responsible              
              for the broad glass transition characteristic of miscible polymer              
              blends.  Therefore, will be used solid-state deuterium nuclear                 
              magnetic resonance to observe the rate of molecular motion in                  
              each component of the blend individually as a function of                      
              temperature through the glass transition.  These observations                  
              will give new insight into the factors that determine the                      
              temperature and breadth of the glass transition.
