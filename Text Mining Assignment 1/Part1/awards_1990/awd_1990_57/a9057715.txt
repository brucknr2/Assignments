Abstract    :
              Dr. Sedivy has developed a gene targeting method for mammalian                 
              cells in culture.  Using this method he will first develop null                
              mutants of the cellular proto-oncogenes c-myc, c-raf, and rb.                  
              He will avoid the possibility of lethality by providing an                     
              extra but conditional copy of these genes.  The main purpose                   
              is to determine the normal function of these genes.  Since                     
              aberrant expression of these genes have been implicated in                     
              cancerous cells, an understanding of their functions in normal                 
              cells may provide information useful to our understanding of                   
              the cancer transformation process.
