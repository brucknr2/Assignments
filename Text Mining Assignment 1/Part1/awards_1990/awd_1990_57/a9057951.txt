Abstract    :
              This first-year Presidential Young Investigator Award will                     
              support Dr. Boult's investigations in 3-D computer vision.  His                
              planned research includes stereo algorithms, surface estimation,               
              segmentation, material identification, error modeling, and                     
              information fusion.  Dr. Boult is also interested in complexity                
              theory and in the psychology of vision.
