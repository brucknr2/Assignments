Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              In this PYI research program will concentrate on                               
              experimentally measuring the properties of multiphase systems,                 
                                                                                             
              interpreting these measurements for comparison to current                      
              theoretical models and refining the models appropriately.  The                 
                                                                                             
              experimental measurements will utilize magnetic resonance                      
              imaging.  Magnetic resonance imaging is a spectroscopic                        
              technique for noninvasively and nondestructively acquiring the                 
                                                                                             
              spatial distribution of species concentrations, velocities,                    
              diffusivities or temperatures within a sample.  Specific areas                 
                                                                                             
              of study are:                                                                  
                                                                                             
              1. Transport processes in porous media: Experiments are                        
              planned to measure local volume averaged saturations and                       
              velocities in single-phase flow and multiphase flow in porous                  
              media.  The overall objective is to make a direct comparison                   
              between measured and predicted fields in the absence of                        
              adjustable parameters.                                                         
                                                                                             
              2. Structure and dynamics of particle sedimentation: A series                  
              of model experiments is planned in which the sedimentation of                  
              various shaped and sized particles will be examined.  The goal                 
                                                                                             
              is to obtain quantitative microstructural data for suspensions                 
                                                                                             
              having different volume fractions of particles, from dilute                    
              through concentrated, and ascertaining the effect if the                       
              suspending fluid properties.
