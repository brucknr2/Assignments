Abstract    :
              This project focuses on research in three areas: Query                         
              Optimization, Active Databases, and Learning mechanisms for                    
              relational database management systems. Query optimization is                  
              necessary to provide fast access to large databases; in this                   
              project, techniques that allow the optimization of multiple                    
              queries, thus providing higher throughput for the system are                   
              developed and implemented in a prototype system. In contrast to                
              the traditional single command-at-a-time optimization, a                       
              multiple-query processing strategy avoids redundant page accesses              
              by accessing data common to more than one query, only once. The                
              research on Active databases investigates methods that allow the               
              specification, efficient monitoring and processing of triggers in              
              relational systems. Such methods are essential in contemporary                 
              systems and allow the database management system to "react" to                 
              changes performed. The use of machine learning is explored at the              
              buffer management and query optimization levels in order to                    
              improve the performance of database systems. In particular,                    
              schemes that will adapt the above sub-systems based on the query               
              and user environment, are investigated.  The contributions of the              
              research in the above three areas lie in improving performance of              
              relational database systems in contemporary applications, such as              
              deductive and engineering databases.
