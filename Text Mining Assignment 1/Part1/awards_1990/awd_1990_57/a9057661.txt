Abstract    :
              The Principal Investigator (PI) intends to research two                        
              specific topic areas; Bivalent Antibody - Multivalent                          
              Antigen Interactions; and, Structure and Dynamics of                           
              beta-Amyloid Protein Aggregation. For the first topic                          
              area, experimental results will be used to construct a                         
              comprehensive numerical simulation of the complex                              
              interactions between antibody and cell-surface antigen.                        
              This quantitative analysis should be useful in developing                      
              antibody-based diagnostic assays or antigen-targeted                           
              therapeutic agents, and in analyzing other                                     
              receptor-ligand systems.  For the second topic area,                           
              aggregation of beta-amyloid protein into fibrils and                           
              subsequent deposition in the brain is believed to                              
              initiate processes leading to abnormalities                                    
              characteristic of Alzheimer's disease.  Techniques                             
              developed to carry out this topic area may lead to a                           
              better understanding of how beta-amyloid protein                               
              aggregation contributes to neurodegenerative processes,                        
              and to the development of new methods to investigate                           
              protein aggregation.
