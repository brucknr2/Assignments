Abstract    :
              Dr. L. Keith Woo of the Iowa State University is supported as a                
              Presidential Young Investigator by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic                 
              and Organometallic Chemistry Program. Dr. Woo's project is                     
              concerned with unusual reactions of compounds of transition                    
              metals, such as iron and molybdenum, in which two or even three                
              electrons are transferred simultaneously. Such processes are                   
              poorly understood and present new experimental and theoretical                 
              challenges. The known examples of such reactions involve metal                 
              complexes of porphyrins, which are related to the iron-binding                 
              center in hemoglobin.                                                          
                                                                                             
              Multi-electron redox reactions, and the accompanying nitrogen                  
              or oxygen atom transfers, between metalloporphyrins will be                    
              investigated. The specific goals of the project include                        
              delineating the scope and generality of nitrogen and oxygen                    
              atom transfer, determining how thermodynamic and kinetic                       
              parameters of these processes vary as a function of molecular                  
              (structural, electronic) changes, and elucidating the                          
              relationship of these processes to other multi-electron                        
              processes such as nitrogen fixation and oxygen activation.
