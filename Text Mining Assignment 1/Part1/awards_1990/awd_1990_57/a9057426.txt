Abstract    :
              It is planned to apply the dc SQUID (Superconducting Quantum-                  
              Interference Device) to mesoscopic systems.  The P.I.'s technique              
              of "stochastic cooling" will be further developed, beginning with              
              studies of electron-phonon thermal transport in mesoscopic                     
              samples.  Studies will also be conducted of the properties of a                
              "mesoscopic atom" -- an isolated, submicron-size, normal-metal                 
              ring.
