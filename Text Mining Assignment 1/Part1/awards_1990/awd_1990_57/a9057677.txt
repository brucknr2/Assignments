Abstract    :
              The Principal Investigator (PI) intends to study the                           
              biological limitations of expression systems used in the                       
              production of pharmaceutical proteins, initially focusing                      
              on yeast as a model organism.  The development of stable                       
              high copy number recombinant vectors and hyper-secreting                       
              mutations in yeast are primary goals. Achieving these aims                     
              will require fundamental research into the molecular                           
              biology of amplified genetic elements and heterologous                         
              protein secretion.  The PI's approach to these problems                        
              will combine the analytical tools of traditional chemical                      
              engineering with the experimental techniques of molecular                      
              and cellular biology.
