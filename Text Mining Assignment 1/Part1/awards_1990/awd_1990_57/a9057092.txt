Abstract    :
              This Presidential Young Investigator Award given in the Organic                
              Dynamics Program supports the research of Dr. Joshua L. Goodman                
              of the University of Rochester.  This work is aimed at                         
              describing accurately the properties of high-energy species                    
              that are formed in chemical reactions, and it will improve our                 
              basic understanding of how chemical reactions occur.                           
                                                                                             
              The experiments that will be carried out by Dr. Goodman will                   
              span three areas:  (1) the study of retinal proteins to                        
              determine how light energy drives chemical and biological                      
              reactions, (2) the investigation of relationships between                      
              structure and energy for organic reactive intermediates, and                   
              (3) the applicability of orbital symmetry selection rules to                   
              odd-electron photochemical reactions.  The work will utilize                   
              time-resolved photoacoustic calorimetry, which allows                          
              measurement of microscopic volume changes of a system following                
              perturbation by photoexcitation.  The magnitudes of these                      
              volume changes can be related to reaction enthalpies and to                    
              volume changes involving reactive intermediates.  The                          
              photoacoustic detection method will be extended to methods of                  
              activation other than photoinitiation.
