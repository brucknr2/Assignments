Abstract    :
                   This project focuses on four topics: 1) data network                      
              architectures 2) multi-user information and communication theory 3)            
              relationship between algebraic coding theory and digital signal                
              processing and 4) generation of pseudo-random sequences for                    
              cryptographic purposes.  The first involves the question of how                
              common communication resources can be shared in a highly flexible              
              manner by a large number of bursty users.  The second involves                 
              questions of the analysis and construction of multi-user coding and            
              modulation schemes for multiple access channels with or without                
              noise.  The third sis directed at exploiting the advantages of both            
              the algebraist's and the engineer's point of view, for example to              
              perhaps characterize the algebraic structure of convolutional                  
              codes.  The fourth looks at new techniques to generate pseudorandom            
              sequences from LFSR sequences over a field with characteristic                 
              different from the characteristic of the desired sequence.
