Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator is studying the coherent                       
              interaction of light with matter, on extremely short timescales                
              (subpicosecond).  Of particular interest is the way in which                   
              the relaxation dynamics of simple electronic systems is                        
              modified by strong optical fields, on time scales shorter than                 
              or comparable to the timescales on which the exchange of energy                
              between the electronic system and a dissipative reservoir                      
              occurs in many solid state systems.
