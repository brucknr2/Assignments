Abstract    :
                   Tolerances play an important role in determining the quality,             
              cost, and time to market, of manufactured products.  Current                   
              tolerancing methods are labor intensive, and error prone.  Research            
              is directed to the development of the theoretical foundations                  
              necessary for the automated computer solution of tolerancing                   
              problems, based on product design specifications derived from                  
              traditional computer-aided design systems.                                     
                   Some of the specific sub-problems being addressed are: the                
              development of a mathematical theory of tolerances that provides               
              a useful algorithmic interpretation of each of the geometric and               
              plus-minus tolerances used in current design practice; the                     
              development of assembly models that capture the semantics of mating            
              feature relationships; the extension of automated tolerancing                  
              capabilities to conceptual design; and the development of                      
              strategies for computational geometry that are robust in the                   
              presence of small simulated manufacturing variations.
