Abstract    :
              This project is in the general area of analytical and surface                  
              chemistry and in the subfield of mass spectrometry.  Professor                 
              David Laude will utilize Fourier transform ion cyclotron                       
              resonance mass spectrometry to monitor flow from                               
              chromatographic experiments.  The utility of the FTMS method                   
              will be expanded via fundamental studies into the ion charge                   
              density movement within the cyclotron cell.  This understanding                
              will allow the development of theory and application of                        
              trapping the ions to improve resolution and mass range in FTMS.                
              This will make the coupling of the method to various                           
              chromatographic experiments realizable.                                        
                                                                                             
              This five year continuing grant to the University of Texas at                  
              Austin for the support of Professor Laude as a Presidential                    
              Young Investigator is designed to promote his rapid and                        
              effective growth as an independent researcher in the area of                   
              Fourier transform methods and mass spectrometry.
