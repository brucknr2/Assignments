Abstract    :
                   A research program in theoretical astrophysics and                        
              gravitational physics will be initiated.  This research will be                
              pursued using both analytic and numerical methods.  In some                    
              cases, observations will be made to compare theoretical                        
              predictions with the behavior of real astronomical systems of                  
              interest.                                                                      
              The topics to be investigated include:                                         
              a)  generation of gravitational radiation in stellar collapsed                 
              and collision                                                                  
              b)  tidal disruption of stars by massive black holes                           
              c)  magnetized stellar winds                                                   
              d)  the eclipsing millisecond pulsar (PSR 1957 + 20).
