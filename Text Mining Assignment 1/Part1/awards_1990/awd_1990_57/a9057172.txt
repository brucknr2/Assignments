Abstract    :
              Over the next five years, two experimental programs with related               
              research goals will be pursued.  The first will better                         
              characterize the natural radio environment of the earth at LF-HF               
              frequencies.  Significant natural emissions have been detected                 
              above the ionosphere in this band, but the study of natural                    
              emissions from the ground have been relatively few.                            
              The second research goal is to undertake experimental studies of               
              non-linear plasma physics processes in space.  Examples include                
              wave-wave and wave-particle interactions, plasma turbulence and                
              non-linear structures such as solitons.  Both kinds of                         
              experiments will develop new software technologies along with                  
              wave receives instrumentation.
