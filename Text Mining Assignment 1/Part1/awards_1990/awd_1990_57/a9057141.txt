Abstract    :
                   A Presidential Young Investigator will continue her research              
              on young children's learning of mathematics in minority settings.              
              The research will include investigation of small group                         
              collaborative learning, small group interactions,  establishment               
              of social norms for cooperation, and affective issues in learning              
              mathematics.  Activities will include classroom teaching                       
              experiments, analysis of data, the development of theoretical                  
              perspectives, and implementation of developed curricula.
