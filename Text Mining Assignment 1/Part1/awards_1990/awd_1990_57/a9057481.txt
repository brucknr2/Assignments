Abstract    :
               This project focuses on sequential as well as  parallel algorithms for
              constrained optimization and   computational geometry. One of the goals in the
              area of   constrained optimization is the application of   recent developments
              in convex optimization to non-linear  membrane and plate problems in mechanics.
               Interior point methods in  optimization are studied further in order to obtain
              better  solutions/heuristics for (hard) integer programming problems.  Research
              in computational geometry with a special emphasis on problems  defined on a set
              of points in high dimension is conducted. Such  high dimensional problems arise
              routinely in classification, pattern  recognition, vision, and speech
              recognition.  A typical problem in  this class would be developing a
              practically workable data structure  for near neighbor search.  In particular,
              all known data   structures that achieve a sub-linear worst-case query time,  
              require an astronomical amount of storage and preprocessing.    This project
              investigates how  techniques in computational geometry may be used to obtain
              better  algorithms for solving large scale linear systems arising in the 
              context of partial differential equations.
