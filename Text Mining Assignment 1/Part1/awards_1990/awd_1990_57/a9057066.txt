Abstract    :
                   During the first year of the PYI program research will                    
              concentrate in the area of computer vision inspection.  An element             
              of success will be the integration of state-of-the-art technology              
              into the development of an automatic on-line inspection system.                
              The system, consisting of a mechanical handler, a vision system,               
              and a dedicated computer, will inspect parts with a polygonal                  
              profile and reject those with out-of-tolerance dimensions, or                  
              surface flaws.  Optimization techniques will be developed to                   
              analyze digital images in order to determine the orientation of                
              parts and to perform dimensional measurement.  The techniques must             
              have the flexibility to handle parts with different polygonal                  
              shapes, size, and tolerance levels.  Quality control issues and                
              procedures to facilitate the real-time implementation of the                   
              techniques will also be investigated.
