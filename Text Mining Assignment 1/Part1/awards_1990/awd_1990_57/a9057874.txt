Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to design a 'process-oriented' environment         
              architecture and build tools to effectively support software                   
              development in a distributed work-station environment.                         
              A process-oriented environment architecture presents itself to the             
              user (e.g., software developer or manager) as a collection of                  
              methodological tools supporting the planning and specification of              
              explicit software process models and their controlled execution,               
              rather than as a collection of tools supporting isolated development           
              activities (e.g., coding or testing).                                          
                                                                                             
              This project involves work in a variety of areas including process             
              modeling, environment architectures, measurement, reuse and learning,          
              and experience bases.  Example research and development tasks include:         
                                                                                             
              o Design of a process-specification driven environment architecture            
                                                                                             
              o Definition and implementation of a comprehensive process                     
                specification language                                                       
                                                                                             
              o Use of measurement data in characterizing project goals and                  
                selecting the appropriate software processes to achieve them                 
                                                                                             
              o Design and implementation of process execution support                       
                                                                                             
              o Using measurements to improve existing process specifications.
