Abstract    :
                   This PYI grant will extend previous studies of coupled                    
              modulational instabilities and non-linear focusing of collinear                
              waves to media with relaxing nonlinearities and to media which                 
              are Brillouin-active.  The dependence of the transition from                   
              absolute to convective instabilities on external parameters                    
              will be determined and the evolution of the instabilities will                 
              be studied through analytic modeling and numerical simulation.                 
              Collaborations with experimentalists will be carried out.
