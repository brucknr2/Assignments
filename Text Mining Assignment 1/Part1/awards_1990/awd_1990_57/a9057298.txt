Abstract    :
              This is an award to provide support for research to be                         
              initiated by this Presidential Young Investigator who was                      
              nominated under conditions contained in the Program                            
              Announcement NSF 89-58.  The broad goals of this                               
              investigator's research are concerned with understanding                       
              the processes that govern the concentrations and fate of                       
              indoor air pollutants.  He plans to work on development of                     
              fundamental information that is needed to assess and                           
              control the physical processes that affect the quality of                      
              indoor air.  He plans to apply deterministic mathematical                      
              modeling of laboratory systems as an interpretive                              
              framework in relating the results of experimental studies                      
              to actual indoor environments.                                                 
                                                                                             
              Results of this research are likely to be utilized in                          
              engineering design of processes and systems to reduce the                      
              unfavorable impact of air pollutants on occupants and                          
              provide the basis for removal of contaminants from indoor                      
              air.  Examples of indoor pollutants he plans to                                
              investigate include radon, radon decay products and                            
              airborne particles.
