Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This Presidential Young Investigator Award will focus on                       
              theoretical studies of polymeric systems; particularly, the phase              
              and interfacial behavior of polymeric materials.  Three general                
              subject areas will be addressed:  (1) Phase behavior of blends                 
              with block copolymers; (2) Interfacial properties of liquid                    
              crystal copolymers; (3) Phase separation of polymer solutions                  
              under flow.
