Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research is directed towards a better understanding of                    
              corrosion behavior in high technology materials.  Emphasis is on               
              metal-matrix composites, which can possess extraordinary                       
              mechanical properties from a combination of extremely strong                   
              particles or fibers in a ductile or brittle metal matrix.                      
              Corrosion properties of these materials are not well known, but                
              it is reasonable to expect galvanic corrosion to occur between                 
              the dissimilar constituents and localized corrosion to be                      
              enhanced by reaction products formed at the reinforcement/matrix               
              interface.  This research is devoted to identification of                      
              corrosion mechanisms in such materials and exploration of                      
              remedies.
