Abstract    :
              A low pressure, flat flame burner will be used to grow diamond                  
                                                                                            
              under highly controlled and well characterized conditions.                     
              Low pressure, porous plug-stabilized flames have a simple one-                 
                                                                                             
              dimensional structure which lend themselves to accurate                        
              modeling and diagnostic probing, providing a significant                       
              advantage for fundamental studies over other types of diamond                  
              growth reactors.  Stable species concentrations will be                        
              measured in the boundary layer of a temperature-controlled                     
              substrate placed in the flow.  Radical species and                             
              temperatures will be measured using laser-induced                              
              fluorescence, resonantly-enhanced multiphoton ionization, and                  
              Raman scattering techniques.  IR/visible sum generation will                   
              be used to detect molecules adsorbed on the substrate during                   
              diamond growth.  A reacting flow numerical model will be                       
              developed and predicted species, temperature, and growth rates                 
                                                                                             
              will be compared to experimentally measured values.                            
                                                                                             
              Diamond films appear very promising for tribological, optical,                 
                                                                                             
              and electronic applications, but the quality of currently-                     
              grown films is insufficient for most uses.  The experiments                    
              planned will be the first to study diamond growth in a                         
              thoroughly characterized environment, and should yield                         
              significant information on the processes responsible for                       
              maximizing growth rate and controlling quality.
