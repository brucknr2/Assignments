Abstract    :
              This Presidential Young Investigator Award is concerned with                   
              nonlinear dynamic response of soil systems.  Efforts will be                   
              directed towards the development of NDE techniques for the                     
              detection of structural integrity deterioration of soil/structure              
              systems due to crack initiation and propagation, scour and/or                  
              piping.
