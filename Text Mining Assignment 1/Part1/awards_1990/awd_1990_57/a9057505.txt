Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              With a Presidential Young Investigator award from the National                 
              Science Foundation, Dr. Mayfair Yang of the University of                      
              California-Santa Barbara, will continue her studies of informal                
              exchanges in mainland Chinese society.  Through her analysis of                
              gift exchange and the exchange of favors, she is revealing the                 
              actual workings of Chinese society, as distinct from the                       
              normative rules published and supported by the state bureaucracy.              
              Dr. Yang will conduct ethnographic research in a small town in                 
              China and conduct participant observation on the variety of non-               
              state organizations, both economic and non-economic, spawned by                
              the economic reforms of the 1980's.  She will analyze their                    
              organization, leadership structure, membership and activities,                 
              relation with the state, and the role of women.                                
              This research is important because these informal exchanges are                
              the "grease" that allows the sticky bureaucratic machinery of                  
              communist societies to function in the actual world, as distinct               
              from the paper world of state planners.  In-depth ethnographic                 
              studies such as Dr. Yang's will help us understand the actual way              
              such societies function, and so will help us deal successfully                 
              with them.
