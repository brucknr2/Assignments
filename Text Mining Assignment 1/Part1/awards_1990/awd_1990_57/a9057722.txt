Abstract    :
              This Presidential Young Investigator intends to study                          
              hydrogenated amorphous silicon.  This "hydrogen glass" material                
              presents unique advantages as a system to probe the physics of                 
              disordered systems.  The structural rearrangements which                       
              underlie the glassy material are readily influenced by doping and              
              alloying, and are manifested by straight forward electronic                    
              measurements.  Among the phenomena to be explored are:  1)                     
              stretched exponential relaxation; 2) the glass transition                      
              temperature; 3) flicker of 1/f noise; and 4) magnetoresistance in              
              the hopping regime.  In addition to enhancing our understanding                
              of the basic physical properties of hydrogenated amorphous                     
              silicon these studies will enable the fabrication of amorphous                 
              semiconductor-based devices with superior qualities.
