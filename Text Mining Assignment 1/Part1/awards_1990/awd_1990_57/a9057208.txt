Abstract    :
              This Presidential Young Investigator Award given in the Organic                
              and Macromolecular Chemistry Program provides support for the                  
              work  ("Molecular Design" or "Molecular Engineering") of Dr.                   
              Eric V. Anslyn at the University of Texas at Austin.   The                     
              research involves the design, synthesis, and utilization of                    
              molecules that accomplish a specific objective or task in a                    
              similar manner to biological molecules.   Molecular recognition                
              and molecular assembly are being used to approach problems in                  
              bioorganic and organometallic catalysis, and solid state                       
              structure design.                                                              
                                                                                             
              One area of study is involved with developing molecular clefts.                
              The interior of the cleft can be used to recognize and bind                    
              several different types of molecules.  The molecules are being                 
              designed to catalytically hydrolyze amides and phosphodiesters.                
              A second area of study involves development of templates that                  
              recognize and bind organic functional groups in organic media.                 
              These templates will be attached to organometallic catalysts in                
              order to accomplish substrate multipoint binding and to impart                 
              specificity in the catalysis.  Another focus of research is on                 
              the development of electrical conductors and  ferromagnets                     
              which possess important properties desired in the semiconductor                
              and data storage industries.
