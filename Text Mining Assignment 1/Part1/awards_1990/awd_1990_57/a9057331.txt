Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              During his five-year Presidential Young Investigator Award,                    
              Dr. Steven Frank, University of California, Irvine, plans to                   
              continue and expand his research activities in four areas.  The                
              first two concern the inherent instability and resulting                       
              dynamics caused by conflict at different genetic and ecological                
              levels.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              Specifically, Dr. Frank will extend his present work on genomic                
              conflict to explain uniparentally inherited sex-biasing                        
              elements and the role of meiotic drive in maintaining                          
              chromosomal inversions and genetic differences between species.                
              Using host-parasite systems, he will also attempt to relate                    
              observable statistics about spacial variation to models of                     
              long-term ecological and evolutionary dynamics that maintain                   
              observable patterns.                                                           
                                                                                             
              A third research goal involves understanding the patterns of                   
              parental investment in male vs. female offspring, including                    
              exploring a different interpretation of sex allocation in warm-                
              blooded vertebrates.  Finally, Dr. Frank will initiate research                
              on the evolution of learning by merging advances in artificial                 
              intelligence and computers with classic methods from population                
              genetics and evolutionary biology.  His goal of applying                       
              advanced computer technology to evolutionary genetics is                       
              particularly innovative and, if successful, may herald a new                   
              era in evolutionary biology research.
