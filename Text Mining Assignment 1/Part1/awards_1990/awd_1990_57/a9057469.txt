Abstract    :
              This research by a Presidential Young Investigator is focused                  
              on experiments in wakes and mixing regions.  These are                         
              characterized by the absence of boundaries but have shear                      
              generated from upstream boundaries.                                            
                                                                                             
              Specific topics to be investigated are:  the effect of bubbles                 
              in a free shear flow, the effect of initial conditions on                      
              cylinder wakes, and study of forcing in a free shear layer to                  
              create either organized three-dimensional structures or chaos.
