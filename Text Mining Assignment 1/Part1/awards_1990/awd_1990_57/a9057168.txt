Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  A Presidential Young Investigator will continue his research              
              into the fundamental groups of Kahler manifolds and the rigidity               
              of finite group actions for subgroups of complex Lie groups.                   
                   The principal investigator will extend his theories of                    
              fundamental groups of certain complex manifolds.  Fundamental                  
              groups are determined by closed loops on manifolds which cannot                
              be deformed into one another.
