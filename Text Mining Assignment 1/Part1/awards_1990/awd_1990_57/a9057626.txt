Abstract    :
                   This research focuses on the mechanical behavior of composite             
              materials during fabrication and during failure.  The myriad                   
              choices available to the designer of composites, combines with the             
              diversity of phenomena which may occur at the various stages of                
              processing and service make modeling of critical importance.                   
              Analytical and numerical techniques will be developed and used,                
              supported by carefully designed model experiments where                        
              appropriate, to provide guidelines for the material designer.                  
                   Two topics initially to be explored are crack growth at                   
              ductile/brittle interfaces and the effect of damage of sintering               
              of ceramic composites.  The former will involve the development of             
              a steady-state algorithm of rather general utility, the latter the             
              incorporation of a constitutive description of a damaged powder                
              matrix into a detailed model of composite sintering.  Each is an               
              example of a micromechanical process with significant macroscopic              
              consequences for the reliability of composite materials.
