Abstract    :
              Saleh         This research is on simulation techniques and modeling  approaches
              for analog circuits.  Accuracy of the analysis is the  key goal.  High-level
              modeling approaches are being developed for  functional blocks in the circuits
              that improve the overall  efficiency of simulation.  Software is being
              developed that  checks for the integrity and robustness of new macro-model 
              primitives before they are used in a simulation.  A consistency  checking and
              optimization tool is being used to verify and  correct the performance of a
              given parameterized macro-model.   The new models and algorithms are being
              integrated into a multi-  level analog simulation tool that includes the
              ability to perform  circuit level, functional level and behavior level
              simulation  within one simulation run.  Circuits considered include sigma- 
              delta modulators, phase-locked loops, and switched capacitor  circuits among
              others.
