Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  A Presidential Young Investigator will study geometric                    
              partial differential equations motivated by problems at the                    
              boundary between mathematics and physics.  He will continue his                
              investigation of geometric aspects of the Atiyah-Singer index                  
              theorem and the relationship between quantum field theory and                  
              low-dimensional topology.                                                      
                   The principal investigator will conduct research in the                   
              emerging field of geometry, topology, and physics.  This will                  
              involve work related to the Yang-Mills partial differential                    
              equations and the Atiyah-Singer index theorem.
