Abstract    :
              This project is in the general field of analytical and surface                 
              chemistry and in the subfield of scanning tunneling microscopy                 
              (STM).  Professor Andrew Gewirth will study the electronic                     
              structure of molecules on surfaces using STM methods.  In                      
              addition, atomic force microscopic methods will be developed to                
              study electrode surfaces.  Both methods will be used in situ.                  
              Particular focus of these studies includes transition metal                    
              containing adsorbates on electrode materials.  The development                 
              of electronic structure measurements using STM spectroscopic                   
              methods will be accomplished.  AFM studies will focus on under                 
              potential deposition (upd) processes in redox active                           
              electrolytes.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              This five year continuing grant to the University of Illinois                  
              for the support of Professor Gewirth is designed to promote his                
              rapid and effective growth as an independent researcher in the                 
              field of tunneling microscopy at electrode interfaces.
