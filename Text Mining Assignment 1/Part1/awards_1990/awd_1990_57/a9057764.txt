Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              For this PYI award research will be conducted in two areas of                  
              theoretical polymer physics: (1) the statistics of polymer blends              
              and solutions, and (2) the dynamics of long polymer chains in                  
              topologically restricted environments.  In the first area studies              
              are underway on equilibrium microphases, their morphology and the              
              dynamics of microphase transitions.  Other studies will include                
              segregation in blends of network with linear polymers or solvent,              
              and homopolymer blend statistics and dynamics.  Computer                       
              simulations and analytic methods will be used to study the                     
              dynamics of polymer chains.
