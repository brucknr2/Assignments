Abstract    :
              The P.I. will study the analysis and design of large-                          
              scale stochastic systems, specifically binary neural                           
              networks and adaptive distributed detection systems.                           
              He will work on a theoretical framework for these                              
              systems, and on demonstration of the application of                            
              the theory in assessing existing designs and in                                
              devising synthesis techniques.  The expected                                   
              applications are in Machine Intelligence and in                                
              Sensor Fusion.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              The objective is to provide designers and users of                             
              neural networks and distributed-detection systems                              
              with a set of reliable polynomial-time algorithms, for                         
              calculating in advance (at least a bound on) the                               
              expected performance.  In particular, such                                     
              assessments are important when the designer using                              
              suboptimal or "intelligent" (i.e. heuristic) design                            
              algorithms.  Often, a close-form optimal architecture                          
              is not available, or the implementation such design is                         
              prohibitive from the computational or the hardware-                            
              complexity viewpoints.                                                         
                                                                                             
              A related objective is to synthesize and assess on-                            
              line learning algorithms, since the common                                     
              assumptions on availability of environmental statistics                        
              and on stationary of the statistics are often not                              
              realistic.
