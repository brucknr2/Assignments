Abstract    :
              Zakhor         This research incorporates signal and image representation, 
              synthesis and restoration, and issues related to the  applicability of
              multiresolution decompositions to various  classes of signals and signal
              processing algorithms.  These  include fractal-type signals to which
              traditional wavelet  analysis applies, and those which are best represented by 
              different filters at different resolutions.  For the latter class  of signals,
              an adaptive subband coding algorithm is being  developed that affects the
              multiresolution decompositions.
