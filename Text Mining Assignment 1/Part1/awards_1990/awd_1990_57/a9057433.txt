Abstract    :
                   This project is devoted to the analyses and developments of               
              various biological and physical phenomena using mathematical                   
              models.  Topology and nonlinear differential equations will be                 
              used in conjunction with problems as diverse as DNA structure,                 
              oscillating cells in the heart and nervous systems, and charge-                
              density waves in quasi-one-dimensional metals.
