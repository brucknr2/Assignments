Abstract    :
              This research by a Presidential Young Investigator is focused                  
              on several thrusts in the area of fluid flow with complex, non-                
              Newtonian fluids.  The approach is both theoretical/numerical                  
              and experimental.  The areas are:  composites, polymer melts,                  
              and suspensions; viscoelastic instabilities; and material                      
              transport characteristics.  In addition, layer phenomena related               
              to plasma etching and bilayer lithography are included in the                  
              research plans.                                                                
                                                                                             
              Impact of the research will be on improved process control for                 
              superior material characteristics involving electronic materials               
              and solid fiber composites.
