Abstract    :
              Research under this Presidential Young Investigator Award will have            
              three main thrusts.  The first is the development of improved                  
              submillimeter receiver components.  The Principal Investigator is              
              particularly interested in expoiting superconducting thin film and             
              tunnel junction technology to develop novel submillimeter circuits.            
              Devices such as SIS mixers, 2-dimensional imaging arrays,                      
              submillimeter Josephson oscillators, SQUID and parametric                      
              amplifiers, low-loss transmission lines, passive components such               
              as filters couplers, and perhaps even integrated receivers are all             
              feasible with this technology.  The second thrust is the                       
              construction of practical receiver systems for astronomical use at             
              the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory and the Antarctic Telescope              
              and also on airborne telescopes, and eventually for space missions.            
              This effort will be pursued in parallel with the first, using                  
              existing components when necessary but taking advantage of new                 
              components as they are developed.  The third thrust is the                     
              employment of these receivers to attack astrophysical problems.                
              Principal interests at present are the structure and physics of                
              molecular clouds, photodissociation regions, molecular outflows,               
              and star-forming regions.  Submillimeter spectroscopy is the                   
              optimal method for studying the warm and dencse gas typically found            
              in these regions.
