Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Numerical solution of partial differential equations is one of                 
              the most computationally difficult tasks in existence, so only                 
              the most efficient algorithms can be used.  The actual numerical               
              formulas used in the algorithms are fairly well understood by                  
              now, but the computational issues arising from geometrical issues              
              are less so.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              One line of research is intended to determine the proper handling              
              of grids for partial differential equations.  Solution techniques              
              such as finite element methods require the subdivision of the                  
              geometric domain into small polygonal elements.  This research                 
              will establish the best ways to carry out this subdivision,                    
              especially when the domain has a complicated shape.  It will                   
              determine the proper method to partition the domain among                      
              processors of a parallel computer.                                             
                                                                                             
              Boundary element techniques show great promise for handling                    
              complicated geometries.  They are receiving recent attention                   
              because of their newly-discovered links to wavelet                             
              transformations.  The research seeks new algorithms that will                  
              speed up boundary element calculations.
