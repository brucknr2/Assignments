Abstract    :
              This PYI award will support research in two topics                             
              including advanced mechanical systems, and advanced                            
              electrical components.  The first research activity focuses                    
              on the dynamics of systems comprising rigid and flexible                       
              bodies.  A unified formulation of such systems will be                         
              developed within the framework of geometrically-exact                          
              structural theories.  Nonlinear characteristics with the                       
              development of robust continuation methods for singular                        
              points/surfaces for nonlinear systems.  The second research                    
              topic focuses on the development of a finite element based                     
              computer aided engineering system for the next generation                      
              of advanced multilayer capacitors (AMLC).  Formulation of                      
              field equations derived from Maxwell's equations will be                       
              developed.  This will be followed by the development of                        
              algorithms for the resulting differential/algebraic                            
              equations, and of methods to synthesize the equivalent                         
              series resistance and inductance of AMLC for subsequent                        
              circuit simulations.
