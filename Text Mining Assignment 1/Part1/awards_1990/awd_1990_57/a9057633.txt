Abstract    :
              The PI's research interests are centered around the development and            
              application of tools for studying charge transport in semiconductor            
              materials.  Such tools are essential in the design and analysis of new         
              high performance device structures and in the study of basic device            
              phenomena.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              During the course of the PYI program, the PI's will demonstrate                
              InP/InGaAs HBTs with collector structures optimized to show enhanced           
              or extended velocity overshoot effects which result from field                 
              profiling.  They will also upgrade their simulators to handle                  
              transport in the strained layer systems which are showing increased            
              promise for device applications.  The recent addition of Professors            
              Joe Campbell and Russ Dupuis to the Microelectronics Research Center           
              has provided a tremendous boost to their experimental HBT                      
              capabilities.  Dupuis's group will provide the MOCVD grown layers and          
              Campbell's group will assist in the high frequency measurement and             
              noise analysis of the HBTs designed and fabricated by the PI's group.          
                                                                                             
              An additional area of research which the PI plans to pursue during the         
              course of this program is the development of approaches to                     
              characterize barrier transport based on noise measurements.  This work         
              will involve both the development of a noise measurement simulator             
              (based on the Monte Carlo approach), and will also involve                     
              experimental characterization of the barrier transport and related             
              noise.  The experimental portion of this work will be done in                  
              collaboration with Professor Dean Neikirk (PYI 1986, Electrical                
              Engineering).
