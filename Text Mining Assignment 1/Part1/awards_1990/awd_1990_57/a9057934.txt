Abstract    :
              This first-year Presidential Young Investigator Award will                     
              support Dr. Aloimonos' work in active vision and navigational                  
              reasoning.  His principle goal is to build robotic systems with                
              robust, real-time visual capabilities for accomplishing specific               
              navigational tasks such as moving object detection by a moving                 
              observer, object tracking, and obstacle avoidance.  Dr. Aloimonos              
              also intends to continue his research in robust scene analysis,                
              visual learning, parallel computation, path planning, and other                
              related topics.
