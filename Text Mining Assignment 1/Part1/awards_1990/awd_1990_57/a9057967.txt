Abstract    :
              The PI does research on the modeling,                                          
              analysis, and control of discrete event                                        
              systems (DES's).  A DES is a man-made                                          
              dynamical system whose behavior is described                                   
              by the complex interactions of distributed,                                    
              communicating, controlled processes.  These                                    
              interactions are modeled by traces of events                                   
              that record significant changes in the state                                   
              of the system.  A process may for example be                                   
              a computer program or a user's transaction in                                  
              a computer system or a machine or a robot in                                   
              a flexible manufacturing system.  The first                                    
              component of the research deals with                                           
              theoretical work on the control of DES's.                                      
              Specific issues being studied include:                                         
              detailed study of the properties of                                            
              controllers for DES's; the synthesis of                                        
              controllers with good qualitative and                                          
              quantitative performance characteristics;                                      
              modeling and analysis of recovery in the                                       
              control of systems that block; and on-line                                     
              supervisory control under partial information.                                 
              Progress on these problems will enhance the                                    
              scope and applicability of the emerging                                        
              control theory for DES's.  The second                                          
              component of the research deals with the                                       
              development of algorithms for controller                                       
              synthesis problems in a relational algebraic                                   
              framework.  This approach is pursued in order                                  
              to address synthesis problems for large scale                                  
              DES's.  Finally, representative case studies                                   
              from the fields of database systems,                                           
              manufacturing systems, and traffic systems are                                 
              being analyzed in conjunction with the above                                   
              development of theory and algorithms.
