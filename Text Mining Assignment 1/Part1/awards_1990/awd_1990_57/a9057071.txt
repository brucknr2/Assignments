Abstract    :
              Buckley         In the general area of Source Localization Estimation (SLE), 
              this research will:  1.     continue SLE algorithm performance evaluation(s); 
              2.     investigate algorithm improvements based on considerations  of
              analytical performance expressions derived during the course  of this project;
              and  3.     address the combined issue of robust estimation and high 
              resolution in the presence modeling errors.         In the area of
              acoustical/biomedical digital signal  processing, specifically hearing aids,
              effort will be directed  towards the specification of algorithm constraints and
               appropriate cost functions, incorporating robustness and real-  time testing
              both in the laboratory and in the field.  Adaptive  methods will be examined
              for use in active noise cancellation of  undesired nonstationary noise.
