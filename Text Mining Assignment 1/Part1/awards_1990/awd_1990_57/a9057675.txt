Abstract    :
              Research is planned to make new advances in                                    
              mm-and sub-mm wave sources, as well as their                                   
              applications.  This work will be based on prior                                
              experience in developing mm-wave Free                                          
              Electron Laser devices at reduced beam voltages                                
              (both high power 0.5-1.0 MV FEL oscillators                                    
              and 50 kV harmonic "ubitron" amplifiers).  The                                 
              new directions, however, will emphasize studies                                
              of compact, "low" voltage (< 100 kV), and                                      
              moderate power (0.1-100 kW) devices to be                                      
              compatible with commercially practical civilian                                
              and government applications.  To accomplish                                    
              new developments in this field, research                                       
              innovations in electron beam generation and                                    
              focusing techniques, small-scale radiation cavities                            
              and periodic structures, and nonlinear efficiency                              
              enhancement and mode control techniques will                                   
              be carried out.  Also research on compact                                      
              periodic structures as an opportunity to research,                             
              develop, and perform (scaled) testing of new                                   
              insertion devices for high energy electron                                     
              storage rings will be performed.  Such insertion                               
              devices should extend the capabilities of U.S.                                 
              storage ring facilities as high brightness IR,                                 
              VUV, and x-ray light source facilities for                                     
              spectroscopic, materials science, lithographic,                                
              and biomedical applications.  Finally, in addition                             
              to the ceramic sintering process, there are                                    
              several new applications for moderate power                                    
              mm-wave sources such as, mm-wave heating of                                    
              a compact, high density, mirror plasma to                                      
              efficiently generate soft x-rays for lithography                               
              and materials processing applications.  Another                                
              interest is to study the use of mm-waves for                                   
              improved thermal processing of dielectric                                      
              coatings.  A third area of interest would be the                               
              previously mentioned use of coherent sub-mm                                    
              sources, (i.e., wavelengths between 0.01-1.0 mm)                               
              for spectroscopy of various chemical chain                                     
              reactions and solid-state semi-conductor                                       
              phenomena.
