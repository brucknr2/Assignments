Abstract    :
                                                                                              
              The PI has discovered a unique protein that appears to be                     
              essential to the biologic clock which determines daily rhythms                 
              controlled by the brain. The discovery of the protein came out of              
              work she did at Harvard on the molecular biology of the "period"               
              gene in the Drosophila and its influence on biological rhythms.                
              From this lowly fly brain an exciting generalization has come                  
              because the proteins which the Drosophila genes express in                     
              neurons are also expressed in the hypothalamus of vertebrate                   
              animals. This indicates the vital importance of the gene to brain              
              function as it has been conserved for millions of years.                       
              Dr Siwicki will study the neurons in the brain by applying an                  
              antibody she has produced to the protein produced by the gene and              
              study the electrophysiology of the identified neurons to test the              
              biological consequence of neurons containing the protein. This                 
              should clarify if cells that produce the product are rhythm                    
              generators which keep the brain "on time" to coordinate brain                  
              function.
