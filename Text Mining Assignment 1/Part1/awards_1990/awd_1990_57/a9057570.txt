Abstract    :
               The semantics of programs and reasoning about them are strongly  influenced by
              the adoption of rich type disciplines.  This research   concerns the
              relationships between type systems on the one hand,  and operational semantics,
              specification logics, correctness proof  systems, and denotational semantics on
              the other hand.  Particular  attention is given to programming with limited
              forms of recursion  enhanced by rich type disciplines, and to automated
              reasoning  (especially rewriting techniques) about such programs relative to
              data  type specifications.  Attention is also given to the  problem of matching
              complex data models, in particular object-oriented  database models, with
              appropriate type systems for data manipulation  languages.  The integration
              under a statically enforceable type  discipline, and in a uniform and
              perspicuous semantic framework, of  class abstraction, inheritance,
              polymorphism, set manipulation, and  persistence helps to increase the
              reliability and maintainability of  database software.
