Abstract    :
              This project focuses on the computational complexity of combinatorial          
              problems.  The principal goal is the development of new techniques for         
              establishing lower bounds on complexity.  A wide variety of                    
              computational models will be investigated, including: Boolean                  
              circuits, communication complexity, proof systems, and the cell-probe          
              model.
