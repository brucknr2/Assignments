Abstract    :
              The P.I.'s currently interested in research in massively                       
              parallel, disturbed, and collective computations,                              
              artificial neural systems, learning machines,                                  
              associative neural memories, photonic computing, and                           
              optical neural network implementations.  In the area                           
              of neural networks, he plans to investigate the                                
              performance of various associative neural memory                               
              architectures and related recording/learning                                   
              algorithms.  He has introduced new high-performance                            
              recording/learning algorithms for associative                                  
              memories, and is currently investigating the dynamics                          
              of such neural memories for various                                            
              recording/learning algorithms.  In the Computation                             
              and Neural Networks Laboratory, he and his students                            
              are developing unsupervised learning self-optimizing                           
              neural net architectures for clustering and                                    
              unsupervised pattern classification.  In another                               
              project, neural net architectures will be employed in                          
              solving complex optimal path finding problems in two-                          
               and higher-dimensions.  He will also be investigating                         
              the optical implementations of artificial neural                               
              systems.  He holds a patent for the first integrated                           
              optical threshold gate ("optical neuron") and has                              
              developed fiber optic cross-bar network fabrication                            
              techniques, which are potentially useful in optical                            
              neural network implementations.  He has recently                               
              completed the design and implementation of a fiber                             
              optic-base high-performance dynamic associative                                
              neural memory prototype.  He is also interested in                             
              the application of neural networks in signal                                   
              processing and parallel  computing.  In a joint effort                         
              with researchers at Wayne State's Neurology                                    
              Department, he is developing a neural-network-based                            
              technique for automatic quantification of the clinical                         
              Electromyogram (EMG) for clinical diagnostic                                   
              purposes.  His future research will focus on adaptive                          
              unsupervised synthesis techniques for high-                                    
              performance dynamic artificial neural networks.  He                            
              will also be investigating ways of speeding up learning                        
              in multiple-layer neural nets through self-optimizing                          
              neural architectures.  His future research will also                           
              involve proposing and implementing large scale high-                           
              performance fiber optic interconnected dynamic                                 
              associative neural memories and other neural                                   
              network paradigms.
