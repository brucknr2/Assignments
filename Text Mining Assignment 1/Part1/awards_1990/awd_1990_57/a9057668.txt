Abstract    :
              This is an award to provide support for research to be                         
              initiated by this Presidential Young Investigator who was                      
              nominated under conditions contained in the Program                            
              Announcement NSF 89-58. The broad goals of this                                
              investigator's research are concerned with understanding                       
              the underlying mechanisms that affect physical and                             
              chemical processes used to treat water and wastewater.                         
              She is particularly interested in to the role of particle                      
              chemistry and physics in coagulation, filtration,                              
              adsorption and disinfection and in the use of ozone as a                       
              destabilization agent and disinfectant in dilute aqueous                       
              systems.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              Results of this research are likely to be utilized in                          
              engineering design of processes and systems for removal of                     
              contaminants from municipal and industrial water supplies.                     
              The results are also potentially applicable to formulating                     
              models that track particles suspended in water as they                         
              move through groundwater aquifers.
