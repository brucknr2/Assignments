Abstract    :
                   This research will consider numerical methods for highly                  
              advective flow problems with particular application to simulation              
              of flows in porous media and incompressible flows modeled by the               
              Navier-Stokes equations.  Discretization by operator splitting                 
              methods will be emphasized.  The advection operator will be                    
              approximated  using the modified of characteristics, and                       
              diffusion-dispersion or viscosity and the Stokes problem will be               
              dealt with using finite element methods.                                       
                   This work should provide new insight into flows in                        
              unsaturated zones and flows in fractured media.
