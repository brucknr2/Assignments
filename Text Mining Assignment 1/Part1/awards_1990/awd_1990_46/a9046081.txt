Abstract    :
              This award will provide supplementary support to enable Dr. Daniel             
              D. Weeks to continue collaborative research with Dr. Tadashi                   
              Kifune at the Institute of Cosmic Ray Research, University of                  
              Tokyo, Japan.  Dr. Weeks will spend a total of 20 months in Japan              
              conducting research in the area of astrophysics.                               
                                                                                             
              Data collected over several years at the Akeno Observatory in                  
              Japan will be analyzed to determine the densities, energies and                
              arrival times of high-energy cosmic rays.  The data will be                    
              subjected to periodic time correlation analysis in an effort to                
              unravel the mysteries of the sources and mechanisms of the cosmic              
              ray emissions.  Dr. Weeks has considerable experience with the                 
              Haleakala gamma-Ray Experiment in Hawaii, and this research                    
              collaboration with Dr. Kifune at the University of Tokyo should                
              prove synergistic.
