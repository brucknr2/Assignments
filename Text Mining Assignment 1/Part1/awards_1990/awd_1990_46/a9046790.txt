Abstract    :
              This project is a continuation of a recent project to                          
              study the in-plane seismic resistance of two-story masonry                     
              walls with openings under the coordinated TCCMAR program.                      
              Additional experimental work will be conducted, using the                      
              existing test set-up to permit (1) out-of-plane movement                       
              at floor levels, and (2) application of out-of-plane                           
              loads.                                                                         
                                                                                             
              This additional study will resolve the discrepancies                           
              existing between two different design concepts: (a) the                        
              earthquake damage is concentrated in vertical masonry                          
              piers and (b) the walls should be designed as coupled                          
              walls in which case the damage will be concentrated at the                     
              wall bases.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              This study will broaden the theoretical basis of masonry                       
              walls design concepts and facilitate the development of                        
              rational design methodologies to resist seismic loads.
