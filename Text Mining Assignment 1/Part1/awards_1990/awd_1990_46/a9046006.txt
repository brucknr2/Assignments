Abstract    :
                   A large NaI detector array will be instrumented for                       
              experiments at the BNL/LEGS high energy gamma facility.  The                   
              first measurements will be of elastic photon scattering from                   
              the proton with 100% linearly polarized gammas, followed by                    
              similar measurements for the deuteron, with an aim of obtaining                
              the nucleon polarizability.  This information is of fundamental                
              interest, and relates to tests of QCD and models of the                        
              nucleon.
