Abstract    :
              Calculus students at many institutions are benefiting from                     
              integrated supplements:  labs exercises, projects, problems, and               
              software packages.  The lab exercises are modelled after a typical             
              chemistry or physics lab, projects involve the student discovering             
              and conjecturing results, and problems are challenging and                     
              realistic.  The software packages provide materials and facilities             
              and run on MS-DOS or Apple Macintosh machines.
