Abstract    :
              This project, entitled "MS WIZ," is designed to motivate young girls to        
              be prepared to select a mathematical, scientific or technical field for        
              their professional major in college.  Hopefully, this will bring a             
              substantial number of women into the fields of science and technology          
              in the near future.  MS WIZ is a summer intensive two week program to          
              help girls believe that it is acceptable to be bright, interested in           
              science, and to be a female.  The purpose is threefold: first, to help         
              girls be exposed to the curriculum content in a way that gets them             
              excited about this subject matter; second, to help girls experience            
              values such as choice; intellectual risk-taking, decision-making and           
              power; and third, to create a community in which young girls have              
              positive role models in these fields and have a personal opportunity to        
              speak, to question and work with women in the sciences at many levels.
