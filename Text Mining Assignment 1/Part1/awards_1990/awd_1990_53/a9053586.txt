Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is a 30 month program sponsored by the Council                    
              for Basic Education. The funds will provide stipends for 150                   
              outstanding high school teachers of science who wish to do an                  
              independent research project on topics which connect science                   
              with other fields such as history of science, science and                      
              society, science and ethics and science and the environment.                   
              The teachers will be selected through a competitive national                   
              search process, provided summer stipends and paired with a                     
              mentor who has done scholarly work in the proposed field of                    
              study. Fellows will be selected on the basis of a submitted                    
              plan which describes the topics to be explored, explains the                   
              strategy for applying the results across disciplines and                       
              shows evidence of a collegial relationship with fellow                         
              teachers in other disciplines so that the likelihood of                        
              disemination will be enhanced. The independent study project                   
              must satisfy the criteria required by the Council for Basic                    
              Education for academic rigor and cross-disciplinary links.                     
              The Council for Basic Education will monitor each Fellow's                     
              progress throughout the study period and evaluate the                          
              effectiveness of the fellowship project in the classroom. The                  
              NSF grant of $600,000 will be matched by $406,029 from the                     
              Council                                                                        
              for Basic Education. This is a matching amount which exceeds 67%.
