Abstract    :
              Students are learning calculus in a laboratory setting and are                 
              discovering for themselves the concepts and problem solving power              
              of calculus.  The overall framework of the laboratory and the                  
              course materials being used were developed with NSF support at Duke            
              University and are being tested in this setting.
