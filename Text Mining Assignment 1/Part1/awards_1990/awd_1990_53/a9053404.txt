Abstract    :
              A forum is established for the dissemination and classroom testing             
              of innovative ideas, pedagogy, and technological advances in                   
              teaching calculus.  Classroom testing is taking place on campuses              
              of California Community Colleges and State Universities under the              
              auspices of the California Calculus Consortium.  Faculty are                   
              introduced to innovative approaches via a summer workshop and these            
              approaches are reinforced through follow-up activities during the              
              academic year.
