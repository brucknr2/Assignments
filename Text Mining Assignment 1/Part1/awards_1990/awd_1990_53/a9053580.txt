Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              New Mexico State University will conduct a four-year program to improve        
              secondary school teaching and learning of mathematics through student          
              "research" projects.  The concept, which has been developed and                
              successfully tested at New Mexico State by the project staff, will be          
              transported to secondary schools and tested via this teacher enhancement       
              program.  In line with the NCTM Curriculum Standards and with principles       
              underlying calculus reform, the idea is to transfer the emphasis from          
              teaching by transmitting information to learning by hands-on problem-          
              solving work.  The program activities will focus on the posing and             
              solving                                                                        
              of substantial problems that form the basis of project-oriented                
              learning,                                                                      
              and on cooperative learning strategies.  All three Las Cruces public           
              schools will participate in this project, with 28 teachers as                  
              participants.                                                                  
              The evaluation component has a unique characteristic in that a high            
              percentage of the Las Cruces high school graduates who continue on to          
              higher education do so at New Mexico State University.  For this reason,       
              the progress of a substantial number of students can be monitored and          
              assessed during the life of the grant.  The project staff has produced         
              materials for over 100 undergraduate student research projects and,            
              together with the participants, the staff will produce 100 for teacher         
              enhancement under this grant.  A leadership component is included to           
              achieve a multiplier effect.  New Mexico State University and the Las          
              Cruces Public Schools have contributed an amount equal to 47% of the           
              National Science Foundation request.
