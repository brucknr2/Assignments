Abstract    :
              Mathematical Scientists are assessing the current state of linear              
              algebra instruction in the undergraduate curriculum in U. S.                   
              colleges and universities, laying a foundation for its improvement,            
              and identifying priorities for further and continuing study.  This             
              endeavor is being carried out by means of a survey of linear                   
              algebra curricula, a workshop at the College of William and Mary,              
              and a conference at the 1991 Joint Mathematical Meetings.  The                 
              institution is contributing an amount equal to the award.***//
