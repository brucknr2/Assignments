Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Science Academy of Austin will conduct the project, "Austin                
              Science and Math Consortium:  A Private Sector School Partnership              
              for Tomorrow's World" to begin restructuring the math and science              
              curricula in grades K-12 and make them components in a district-               
              wide integrated "thinking curriculum."  The project will address               
              uses of technology in education, environmental issues, and                     
              scientific and mathematical literacy.  Sixty teachers will be                  
              trained each summer for four summers in the use of technology.                 
              Two summer institutes will be conducted in the BSCS elementary                 
              school curriculum, and teachers will participate in environmental              
              summer programs.  Linkages will be developed among teachers,                   
              students, university faculty, and public and private sector                    
              leaders.  An additional 10 to 15 Science Academy students will be              
              provided each year to conduct classes in elementary schools.                   
              Interdisciplinary Science Academy courses will be developed on                 
              Planet Earth an on physics and technology.
