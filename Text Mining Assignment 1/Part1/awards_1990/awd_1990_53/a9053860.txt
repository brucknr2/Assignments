Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              This project is designing and implementing a model to assist in                
              integrating people with orthopedical disabilities into careers in              
              technology.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              Twenty-four orthopedically disabled individuals have been chosen               
              to be provided with an education opportunity in the Construction               
              Technology Department of Indiana-Purdue University at Indianapolis             
              through a special Certificate Program.                                         
                                                                                             
              Handicapped accessible computer stations are being established and             
              equipped with software for students with disabilities.  Computer-              
              aided and other innovative types of instructional methodologies are            
              being developed and employed in the courses in this program.                   
              Education of the disabled in technology programs are being                     
              researched through this model undertaking.                                     
                                                                                             
              Disabled students are thus able to access mainstream construction              
              technology education and resultant careers.  Graduates of the model            
              project will be placed in the industry and their progress                      
              monitored.
