Abstract    :
              Students are learning the geometric aspects of calculus using                  
              computer graphics and are learning the mathematical concepts via               
              a mathematical programming language that allows them to make                   
              standard mathematical constructions using standard mathematical                
              notation:  drill and practice are being reducing by using a                    
              computer algebra system.  Research into the process of learning the            
              underlying ideas of calculus is also being conducted.
