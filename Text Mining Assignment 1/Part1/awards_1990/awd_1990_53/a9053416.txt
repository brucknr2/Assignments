Abstract    :
              Students are achieving increased understanding of concepts, seeing             
              the unity of the important topics in calculus, obtaining a deeper              
              geometric understanding, and learning problem-solving skills in a              
              new calculus course that integrates large, open-ended problems into            
              the curriculum.
