Abstract    :
              Courseware is being developed for a self-paced course on modern                
              electronic instrumentation and computerized data acquisition.                  
              This course is aimed at lower division students from all                       
              engineering disciplines as a lead-in to their discipline                       
              oriented laboratory courses.  All of the course instruction is                 
              computer-based; students work individually with laboratory                     
              equipment, guided by the computer program.  A library of                       
              modules is supplied allowing faculty to adapt the courseware to                
              the specific hardware available in their laboratories. The                     
              first phase of the development is already complete and the                     
              resulting courseware has been successful used in two courses at                
              Stanford. This project extends the coverage of the existing                    
              courseware, refines the courseware adding, in particular, more                 
              direct testing of the student by the computer, and develops the                
              library of modules specific to hardware not presently used in                  
              Stanford laboratories.  Finally, a workshop is to be held to                   
              introduce the courseware to engineering faculty at other                       
              universities and to develop a team of collaborators for further                
              refinements.
