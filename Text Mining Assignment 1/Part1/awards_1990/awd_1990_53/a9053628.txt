Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Mathematical Sciences Education Board (MSEB) is a board of the             
              National Academy of Sciences (NAS) enabled to coordinate and assist the        
              process of mathematics education reform in the United States.  MSEB is         
              charged with building alliances, promoting cooperation, and encouraging        
              national, regional, and local projects.                                        
                                                                                             
              The MSEB will pursue the following goals to provide:  (1) leadership of        
              continuing efforts to improve mathematical sciences nationally; (2)            
              coordination among existing mathematics education projects; (3) service        
              to localities and states, through assistance in determining curricular         
              goals and higher standards for all students, and improving teacher             
              preparation; (4) recommendations of ways to strengthen weak parts of the       
              infrastructure of mathematics education; (5) information to increase           
              public understanding of the rapidly changing missions and character of         
              the mathematical sciences; and (6) advice to federal, state, and local         
              agencies on long-range goals and needs in mathematical sciences                
              education.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              In order to pursue these goals, the present proposal will fund five            
              major initiatives (Leader Initiative):  school mathematics projects,           
              college/university projects, state and local networks, minority                
              programs, and general outreach.  NAS currently supports the executive          
              director and staff of MSEB, NSF will support the five major initiatives        
              plus policy formation, strategic planning, and project creation by the         
              Board and its working committees.  Support for project implementation is       
              obtained through separate grants from foundations and agencies both            
              private and public.
