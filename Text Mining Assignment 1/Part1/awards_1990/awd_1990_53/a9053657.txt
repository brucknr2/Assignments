Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              The major goal of Project Linkage is to increase the number                    
              and effectiveness of Wisconsin partnership programs that                       
              stress science and mathematics education.  The Wisconsin                       
              Academy of Sciences, Arts, and Letters plans to accomplish                     
              this task by (1) identifying existing appropriate                              
              partnerships, (2) developing a framework for improved                          
              understanding of the initiations, implementations, and                         
              outcomes associated with these partnerships, (3) conducting                    
              and disseminating case studies for specific partnership                        
              components, (4) creating a climate for the awareness and                       
              importance of existing partnerships, (5) encouraging and                       
              assisting the formation of new partnerships, and (6)                           
              developing a continuing linkage of existing and projected                      
              partnerships through a newsletter and annual conference.
