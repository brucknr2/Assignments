Abstract    :
              Students are discovering the concepts and ideas of calculus by                 
              exploration and experimentation in a revitalized calculus course,              
              called Calculus & Mathematica, that combines the concept of                    
              calculus as a laboratory science with correct mathematical                     
              foundations.  The classroom/laboratory is equipped with Macintosh              
              computers and the text materials are presented via the Notebook                
              feature of Mathematica.
