Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  CUNY City College will develop, implement, and evaluate a                 
              program for preparing secondary science and mathematics teachers.              
              The program includes an aggressive recruitment campaign in the                 
              New York City Schools, a preparatory semester prior to the                     
              freshman year for students with ability but requiring enhancement              
              of skills before beginning freshman work, a restructuring of the               
              freshman science and mathematics courses, an active system of                  
              tutoring and support, and opportunities for the students to serve              
              as tutors and interns.  Throughout the program there will be                   
              emphasis on the development problem solving skills, promoting                  
              active student-centered learning, and the formation of support                 
              and study groups.  The project will continue work begun under the              
              grant TPE-8954736.  The University's cost sharing will be 52% of               
              NSF's contribution.
