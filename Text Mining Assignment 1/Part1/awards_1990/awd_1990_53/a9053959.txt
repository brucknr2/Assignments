Abstract    :
              This project involves a cooperative effort among eleven                        
              institutions in the Maricopa County Community College District, in             
              cooperation with Arizona State University and 58 public school                 
              districts in Maricopa County.  The project consists of a set of                
              coordinating activities, designed to increase significantly the                
              representation of minorities, blacks, Hispanics, and Native                    
              Americans in science, engineering, and technology.                             
                                                                                             
              The minority enrollments (1988-89) were 73% Hispanic, 19% Black,               
              and 8% Native American.  A total of approximately $450,000 has been            
              committed for the first year in leveraged funds.  There are several            
              creative characteristics to the program, such as day care                      
              facilities, bilingual materials, and programs for parents.  Other              
              program activities include 22 summer camps, precollege motivational            
              and nurturing experiences, after school tutoring, hands-on                     
              laboratory work, and research minigrants.                                      
                                                                                             
              The needs have been well documented.  The management plan is                   
              strong.  The competence of staff and documented, relevant                      
              experience are outstanding.                                                    
                                                                                             
              The District, as a measure of its commitment and support, will                 
              assume, by the fifth year, the full salary of the project director.            
              In addition, an 8% indirect  cost rate is use to maximize the funds            
              available for the program.
