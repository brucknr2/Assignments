Abstract    :
               This project provide 20-25 undergraduate women (recruited                     
              from SIUC and seven surrounding community colleges) with an                    
              intensive two-week workshop in the sciences to expose them to                  
              science career options. Sciences include mathematics,                          
              zoology, chemistry,plant ecology, geology, psychology, animal                  
              sciences, and microbiology. Activities cover such fields as                    
              molecular biology and recombinant DNA, assessing ecological                    
              integrity, gene expression after bacterial transformation,                     
              geologic  hazards, and biotechnology of mammalian embryos. Two                 
              additional single day workshops and three individual                           
              mentoring sessions will follow throughout the academic year.                   
              Women scientists from industry give seminars during both the                   
              summerand academic year workshops to expand  participants'                     
              perceptions of science career options. A second group of                       
              women will be recruited for the second year for a total of                     
              40-50 participants.                                                            
              Measurable objectives designed to measure project                              
              effectiveness include:                                                         
                                                                                             
                   - The number of participants with undeclared majors who                   
                     select science majors.                                                  
                                                                                             
                   - The number of participants who decide to become                         
                     science teachers.                                                       
                                                                                             
                   - Of participants who do not enter a four-year college                    
                     (e.g., for economic reasons), the number who enter                      
                     science-oriented careers with their two-year degree.                    
                                                                                             
                   - A significantly lower drop-out rate (including change                   
                     to a non-science major) than among the general                          
                     population of women science majors.
