Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Field Museum requests $1,033,456 from NSF for the                         
              geological and biological science portions of the new, 14,000                  
              square-foot multidisciplinary exhibit on Africa.  This $3.45                   
              million permanent reinstallation will capitalize on Field                      
              Museum's extensive African collections.  We intend to use these                
              collections and other presentational strategies, broad                         
              scientific and community input to develop a sensitive and                      
              appealing exhibit that will advance central scientific themes                  
              in anthropology, geology, ecology, and conservation.  A variety                
              of techniques will be used to appeal to the individual                         
              interests, needs and learning styles of our diverse audience.                  
              Project director will be Michael Spock, Vice President for                     
              Public Programs at Field Museum.  Co-developers will be Karen                  
              Hutt and Fath Ruffins.  Exhibit consultants and advisors                       
              include Field Museum scientists and educators, and experts in                  
              the fields of biology, zoology, and conservation from outside                  
              the Museum.  An estimated 14 million children and adults will                  
              be reached by this ehibit over the next 20 years, and extensive                
              documentation of the exhibit development process will serve as                 
              a model for development of other comprehensive exhibits                        
              throughout the world.
