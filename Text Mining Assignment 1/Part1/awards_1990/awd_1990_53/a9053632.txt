Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The Museum of Science will design and produce an                          
              exhibition, "Two of Every Sort", whose aim is to present a                     
              scientific basis for the public's understanding of genser,                     
              reproduction and human diversity.  Using interactive techniques                
              and state-of-the-art media technology, the exhibition will                     
              debut at the Museum in Boston, tour science centers in seven                   
              other cities and reach an audience of nearly 2.5 million.  The                 
              eight museums are members of the Science Museum Exhibit                        
              Collaborative, which has approved "Two of Every Sort" as one of                
              a second round of shared-cost exhibitions scheduled to appear                  
              at each of the member institutions.  "Two of Every Sort" (4,000                
              square feet) will present introductory scientific overview,                    
              ranging among biology, anthropology, botany and biomedical                     
              technology, to make discussion of these difficult and sensitive                
              matters more meaningful.  The exhibit will offer an unusual                    
              opportunity to millions of people -- families, teachers and                    
              youngsters, to consider complex questions in a safe, friendly                  
              learning enviroment.
