Abstract    :
              This model project is designed to improve access for disabled                  
              students by dissemination of information among college teachers by             
              intensive recruitment of disabled students, by consultation, and               
              by establishing a lending library of adaptive technology and                   
              special science  materials.  The institution has an excellent track            
              record of faculty research on technology aids for the disabled and             
              an information dissemination regarding science education for the               
              disabled.  The State Department of Public Instruction has a network            
              of regional education centers to promote support services to local             
              schools.  An additional network, in place, is the Rural Education              
              Institute at the University.  The strengths of the project are its             
              innovation and its potential for dissemination and replication.//
