Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History is developing                 
              an innovative exhibit and teaching laboratory called                           
              INTERACTIONS.  The unique feature of INTERACTIONS is the                       
              combination of an exploratory, interactive natural science                     
              exhibit with an adjacent live-insect-rearing laboratory.  The                  
              exhibits will give the visitors some of the exploratory tools                  
              and experiences of the scientist and involve them in the                       
              process of scientific discovery.  The laboratory will provide                  
              visitors with direct experience with scientists and involve                    
              them in the scientific process.  Ecological in scope,                          
              INTERACTIONS will communicate environmental issues.                            
                                                                                             
                   The museum's plant and insect halls, designed over thirty                 
              years ago, will be renovated totally.  In their place, a                       
              single, large exhibit and teaching laboratory will be created                  
              focusing on the interactions of insects and plants.  The                       
              exhibits, videos, computer stations, and adjacent insect                       
              rearing laboratory will invite visitors to participate,                        
              question and examine.  This combination of exhibits, hands-on                  
              activities, video, and laboratory will increase the retention                  
              of information, stimulate interests in natural science, and                    
              give vitality to the museum experience.                                        
                                                                                             
                   The total cost of renovation, modernizing, exhibit                        
              construction and installation is $1,340,000 with $1,000,000                    
              raised by a vigorous capital campaign.  This request is for the                
              balance of $340,000 to complete the exhibit construction.
