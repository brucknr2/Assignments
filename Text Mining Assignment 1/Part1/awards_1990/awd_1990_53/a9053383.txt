Abstract    :
              Students in the Accelerated Calculus Program are benefiting from               
              a new curriculum that treats beginning calculus as a laboratory                
              course with Next computers and Mathematica software as the                     
              equipment.  Students, in classes of 125, work on open ended                    
              projects with assistance from graduate teaching assistants,                    
              upperclass undergraduates, and faculty.
