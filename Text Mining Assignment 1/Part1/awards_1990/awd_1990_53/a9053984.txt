Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              This project is building on the success of Gallaudet University's              
              involvement in problem solving education by beginning a national               
              initiative to improve problem solving skills of high school and                
              college deaf students.  An Advisory Panel to plan a National                   
              Initiative to Improve Problem Solving Skills of Deaf Students has              
              been formed.  The Advisory Panel includes representatives, some of             
              whom are deaf, from various disciplines.  These disciplines include            
              deductive reasoning, inductive reasoning, non-traditional thinking,            
              the use of symbolism in reasoning, hand-on scientific museums,                 
              invention, teaching problem solving techniques to deaf students,               
              as well as deaf education.                                                     
                                                                                             
              The panel met for two days to accomplish the following:  a written             
              statement delineating the scope of "problem solving" as it pertains            
              to this effort; an outline of a practical plan to improve problem              
              solving skills of deaf students nationally; identification of                  
              mechanisms for implementation; identification of personnel and                 
              organizational resources; and a comparison of the similarities and             
              differences of the approach to what would be possible for the non-             
              dear population to determine whether a parallel effort should be               
              made for hearing students.                                                     
                                                                                             
              It is expected that the analysis of deaf students' problem solving             
              skills will provide insight into those aspects of general problem              
              solving skills related to visualization -- and this should be of               
              value to the general student population.
