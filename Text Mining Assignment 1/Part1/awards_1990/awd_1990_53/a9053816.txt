Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project of the Cleveland Education Fund aims to improve                   
              student performance by establishing NCTM standards for teaching                
              high school mathematics in Cleveland.  A representative racial                 
              and gender mix will be sought, both in enrollment in classes and               
              in the contact the students have with the business partners.  A                
              new curriculum will be developed and implemented in Cleveland                  
              high schools.  Problem-solving abilities will be enhanced.  The                
              effectiveness of the NCTM standards in an urban setting will be                
              determined.
