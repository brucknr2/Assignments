Abstract    :
              This pilot project focuses on the development of computer                      
              modules that present the fundamentals of archeology to                         
              undergraduate students in an interactive, visually stimulating                 
              context.  The software modules, involve: 1) stratigraphy and                   
              relative dating, 2) artifact classification, and 3) analysis of                
              animal bones have a strong visual component, and employ current                
              techniques of video image analysis that allow students to                      
              participate in the process of science, not just its results.                   
              It is hoped that by providing stimulating laboratory exercises                 
              with a significant visual component, that the recruitment and                  
              retention of students in the sciences will be enhanced,                        
              especially with respect to the significant Native American                     
              population served by the institution.
