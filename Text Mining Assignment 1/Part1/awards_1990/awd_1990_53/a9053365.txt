Abstract    :
              The introductory linear algebra curriculum that is typically part              
              of the two-year calculus sequence is being revitalized by the                  
              introduction of computer projects and related material.  The                   
              projects are diverse in nature, ranging from those that explore                
              mathematical concepts to those that involve mathematical models.
