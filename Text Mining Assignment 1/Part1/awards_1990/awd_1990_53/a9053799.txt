Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              The University of Arizona will carry out a project for                         
              preparing teachers of secondary science and mathematics.  As                   
              is the case in many large research-oriented institutions, the                  
              university previously had not capitalized on its resources                     
              and faculty to produce significant numbers of secondary                        
              teachers.  Under this project, a close-knit alliance of                        
              scientists, mathematicians, educators, and teachers will                       
              develop a coordinated curriculum that integrates education in                  
              the content areas with pedagogical preparation.  The program                   
              will include rigorous content-area courses, subject-specific                   
              pedagogical courses, a range of practice teaching situations,                  
              and paid summer internships in research laboratories.                          
              Special attention will be given to recruiting and retaining                    
              minorities.  Throughout the program the students' interest in                  
              teaching will be nurtured and encouraged by careful advising,                  
              close supervision, and follow-up during the first years of                     
              teaching.  The University's cost sharing will be 25% of NSF's                  
              support.
