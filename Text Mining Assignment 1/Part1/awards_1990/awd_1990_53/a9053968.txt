Abstract    :
              Prince George's Community College (PGCC) and the University of                 
              Maryland at College Park (UMCP) will conduct a model program in                
              cooperation with the Prince George's County Public Schools.  The               
              program is designed to address the shortages of woman and monorities           
              among engineers and scientists.  The program, Sciences and You (SAY),          
              will strengthen 30 women students' backgrounds in 1-3 weeks summer             
              institutes, after graduation from high school and enroll them in a             
              two year mathematics or science transfer program at PGCC.  They will           
              complete their baccalaureate degrees at UMCP.  The goal is to bring            
              at least 50% of the original cohort to graduation in                           
              science/engineering fields.  Internships, monitoring, tutorials,               
              field trips, parent/student evenings are among the program                     
              activities.
