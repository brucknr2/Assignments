Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This eighteen-month project is designed to help teachers                       
              gain insights into their students' mathematical cognition.                     
              The project will develop assessment techniques which                           
              teachers in grades 2 and 3 may use to learn about their                        
              students' mathematics thinking and learning in the                             
              classroom.  The clinical interview, a technique normally                       
              used only as a research methodology in developmental and                       
              educational psychology, will serve as the basis for the                        
              development of the assessment techniques.  Skilled teachers                    
              will participate in the development; four diverse school                       
              districts have agreed to participate in a substantive way in                   
              the project.  Project activities include: a series of three                    
              workshops for teachers and supervisors introducing educators                   
              to general concepts concerning children's mathematics                          
              learning and understanding, focusing in particular on second                   
              and third grade learners, and introducing the ideas of                         
              clinical interviewing. (The workshops will be based                            
              primarily on the materials for teachers developed in TEI-
