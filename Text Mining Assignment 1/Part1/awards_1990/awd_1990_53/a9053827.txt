Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project at the University of California at Berkeley is                    
              entitled, "Science and Societal Issues:  Industry and Education                
              Partnership Program at the Lawrence Hall of Science."  This                    
              three-year project uses practicing scientists in the development               
              of activities that will introduce students and teachers to topics              
              in the scientist's area of expertise.  The emphasis is on science              
              topics that relate to current societal issues, such as global                  
              warming, acid rain, AIDS, recombinant DNA technology, and the                  
              effects of drugs on the brain.                                                 
                                                                                             
              A one-day program will be held each year to introduce                          
              participating scientists to hands-on activities that relate to                 
              societal issues of relevance.  A Science and Societal Issues                   
              Symposium will motivate 500 high school students each year to                  
              confront the ethical and societal issues raised by recent                      
              scientific and technological advances.  Fall meetings will model               
              activities and pair teachers and scientists.  Each scientist will              
              spend at least four days per year visiting classrooms.  Spring                 
              follow-up meetings will enable teachers, scientists, and staff to              
              assess the progress of the project and generate new ideas.
