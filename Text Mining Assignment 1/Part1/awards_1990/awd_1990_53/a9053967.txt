Abstract    :
              The computer provides handicapped people in this modern society a              
              tool which can greatly enhance their chances of independent living             
              in many ways.  It permits them to live more normal lives.  This                
              program proposes to utilize special education majors by teaming                
              them with handicapped students.  The special education majors                  
              involved will receive instruction related to the specific hardware             
              and software required by their teammates.  They, in turn, will have            
              the responsibility of teaching these computer related skills to                
              their partners.                                                                
                                                                                             
              This program will provide all students involved with the basis for             
              further studies in the area of computing; the special education                
              students will be provided with important exposure to tools of their            
              trade not normally received in an undergraduate program and the                
              handicapped with knowledge that will make them more marketable.                
              Matching funds are available.
