Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This two-year project will double or triple the time spent on                  
              science and mathematics by elementary students in Marshall                     
              County, West Virginia.  The Science and Mathematics Education                  
              Enhancement Council (SciMEEC), an incorporated group of                        
              citizens, parents, teachers, and scientists, is collaborating                  
              with 12 public and 4 private schools in the county to develop 32               
              weekly after-school hands-on science and mathematics experiences               
              for children in each grade, K through 6, whose parents wish to                 
              enroll them.  Each of the seven levels will build upon those                   
              which have come before but will also be sufficiently self-                     
              contained to permit students to enter at any grade level.  Two                 
              parents whose children are enrolled will be recruited and                      
              trained to serve as volunteer assistants for each of the school                
              teachers who are involved in the project.  Additional support is               
              being provided by the corporate sector in both cash and in-kind                
              contributions.  At the end of NSF support the project will be a                
              self-sustaining program through contributions from the corporate               
              sector and fees from participants.
