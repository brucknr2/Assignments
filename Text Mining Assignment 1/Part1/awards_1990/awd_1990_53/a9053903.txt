Abstract    :
                   The College of Engineering at the University of California,               
              Davis, in cooperation with the Sacramento Valley Section of                    
              the Society of Women Engineers, is developing, testing,                        
              evaluating and refining activities to increase the rate of                     
              perseverance of female undergraduate students in engineering.                  
              The project builds on the College's significant number of                      
              women students and faculty members; its professional staff                     
              members who have extensive experience in establishing                          
              successful programs in engineering and the well-established                    
              campus networks for women in math and science. It addresses                    
              the following factors identified by women students, faculty                    
              and professional engineers that negatively affect the                          
              persistence of women in engineering: isolation, an inability                   
              to see the relevance of highly theoretical basic courses,                      
              negative experiences in laboratory courses, the "cold"                         
              classroom climate and the lack of role models. Evaluation                      
              will be done in cooperation with the campus Women's Resource                   
              and Research Center. Activities include: "Brown Bag Lunches                    
              for Women in Engineering" to address the isolation                             
              experienced by freshman and sophomore engineering students;                    
              "Shadowing Women Engineers at Work" to counter the negative                    
              effects of the highly theoretical courses in the freshman and                  
              sophomore years; a new course, "How Things Work" to overcome                   
              deficiencies resulting from women students' lack of                            
              socialization in how things work and in how male culture                       
              works; "Enhancing the Classroom Climate", a faculty workshop                   
              for male engineering faculty to sensitize them to the                          
              "chilling" dynamics of engineering classrooms; and,                            
              Undergraduate Research, a continuing effort to help women                      
              engineering students realize how what they have learned                        
              applies in "real engineering and to encourage them to use                      
              their abilities in graduate study. Activities are designed so                  
              that, once tested and refined, they can easily be replicated                   
              on other university campuses.                                                  
              Measurable Objectives to determine the effectiveness of the                    
              project include:                                                               
                                                                                             
                   o The persistence and graduation rates of women                           
                     participants will be compared with the persistence and                  
                     graduation rates of women who did not participate in                    
                     any component of the project.
