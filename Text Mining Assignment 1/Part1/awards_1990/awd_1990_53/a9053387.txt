Abstract    :
              Calculus students are benefiting from a newly designed course in               
              vector calculus and differential equations that equips them with               
              the basic tools of modern mathematical modeling.  As a result of               
              analyzing a sequence of "discovery projects", students see how                 
              real-world questions may engender theoretical tools and how these              
              tools amy then be extended to new applications.  The independent               
              experimentation, conjecture, and testing this fosters builds the               
              confidence needed for independent work or group leadership.
