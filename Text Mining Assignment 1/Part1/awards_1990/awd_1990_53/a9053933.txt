Abstract    :
              Hudson Valley Community College will collaborate in this model                 
              project with two N.Y. State organizations:  Commission for the                 
              Blind and Visually Handicapped;  Office of Vocational & Educational            
              Services; and with Troy Resource Center for Independent Living,                
              Capital District Center for Independence, and the IBM Corporation.             
              The goal of this model project is to develop a career access ladder            
              in science, engineering and technologies for individuals with                  
              disabilities.  Several innovations characterize the project,                   
              including an alternative, short term approach to academic                      
              programming, a supportive academic environment, a pre-employment               
              training program, and computer networking of academic resources.               
              The program has support form the college, IBM, and state and local             
              agencies.  It will build upon successful intervention projects,                
              with an incremental approach to specific needs, i.e. a motivational            
              phase, followed by several training levels or steps.  The training             
              program will feature a curriculum designed by the Business Advisory            
              Council, with job readiness skills component to ensure effective               
              transition from training to the work environment.  The                         
              identification of needs and deliverables uniquely characterizes                
              project.
