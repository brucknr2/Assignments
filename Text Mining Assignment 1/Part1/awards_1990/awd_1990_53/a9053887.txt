Abstract    :
                   Through a two phase endeavor, this investigation is                       
              initiating a model program that will make the disabled aware                   
              of their potential to become engineers, and is establishing                    
              innovative means to bring these individuals into the                           
              engineering education system.  Phase one special education                     
              personnel in private and public schools and others who have                    
              direct interaction with the disabled to explain the goals of                   
              the program and enlist their aid in achieving these goals.                     
              %%%                                                                            
              In similar fashion, engineering firms and profesesional                        
              organizations are being approached to make a commitment to the                 
              education and employment of the disabled.                                      
              %%%                                                                            
              The work of the second phase involves exploring for ways to                    
              make engineering education possible and attractive to the                      
              disabled.  Recruited tools are being divised, from interactive                 
              computer programs to incentive booklets.  An outreach seminar                  
              is being planned whose main purpose will be to make an                         
              engineering career for the handicapped a reality in the minds                  
              of the disabled and those who work with the disabled.                          
              %%%                                                                            
              A third phase is planned and would see the model program                       
              expanded to a nationwide forum.  The lessons learned and                       
              knowledge gained in the current project will be transferred                    
              to concerned persons thought regional centers at strategic                     
              locations in the United States.
