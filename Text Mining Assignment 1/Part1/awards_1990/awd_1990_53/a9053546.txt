Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              During each of three years this project will provide                           
              opportunities for 20 middle/junior high school science                         
              teachers.  The six-week summer institutes will be held at the                  
              University of Missouri - Rolla, beginning in 1991.  Each                       
              institute will consist of two separate courses; one will                       
              cover the concepts of earth and environmental science, the                     
              second, atmospheric science and meteorology.  The                              
              participants may receive three graduate credits for each of                    
              these courses.  The institutes will combine lectures and                       
              discussions with extensive hands-on laboratory and field                       
              exercises.  Particular attention will be given to developing                   
              lesson plans, teaching materials and exercises that will be                    
              applicable for classroom use at the teachers home                              
              institutions.  The modeling of the "public hearing" format in                  
              applying earth science subject matter to real world problems                   
              should prove to be exciting when transferred to teacher's                      
              classrooms.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              Two follow-up meetings during the academic year will focus on                  
              sharing of teacher generated activities and problems                           
              associated with their use.                                                     
                                                                                             
              The project will serve teachers from Missouri and neighboring                  
              states.  Cost sharing from participating school districts and                  
              the University of Missouri - Rolla in an amount of $72,138                     
              equals 25% of the NSF award.
