Abstract    :
              College and pre-college faculty are learning how to use computer               
              algebra systems in the teaching of calculus.  Strong emphasis is               
              placed on using these systems in such a way that the calculus                  
              curriculum is improved by introducing numerical and graphical                  
              experimentation and by focusing on problem solving and                         
              understanding of concepts.
