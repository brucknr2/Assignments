Abstract    :
                   This project, Women in Engineering, Science and Technology                
              (WEST), established at New Jersey Institute of Technology,                     
              will facilitate the transfer of women, upon completion of                      
              their community college curricula, from 19 New Jersey                          
              community colleges to engineering, science and technology                      
              programs at four year colleges and universities. During the                    
              first year, the WEST office will work with some of the 14                      
              community colleges with which articulation agreements already                  
              exist. Special efforts will be made with urban-based colleges                  
              enrolling a high percentage of minority women After the first                  
              year, WEST will expand its efforts to other community                          
              colleges in the state. One goal is to recruit at least 200                     
              women per year to the project through career days and                          
              seminars.                                                                      
              Evaluation and assessment of project outcomes will be                          
              determined by:                                                                 
                                                                                             
                   - the percent increase of women enrolled in engineering,                  
                     science & technology programs at community colleges                     
                     who transfer to 4-year colleges at the end of Spring

                     undeclared majors who choose engineering, science and                   
                     technology majors at the end of the Fall 1991 and
