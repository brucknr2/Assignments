Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is an extension of an earlier Maine Audubon Society               
              elementary science project.  The current activity will identify                
              and motivate potential leaders in science education and help them              
              improve the teaching in their district. Twenty elementary teacher              
              and administrator teams will come together in an intensive three-              
              day seminar to focus on elementary science needs in their                      
              systems, to build administrative support for an activity-oriented              
              school science, and to work on professional development plans to               
              address local needs.  Once this planning is completed the                      
              teachers will participate in a two-week summer institute to                    
              develop leadership skills and strengthen their science                         
              backgrounds.  During the following school year each lead teacher               
              will plan and implement local workshops and will work with peers               
              to help them introduce hands-on inquiry oriented science in their              
              classrooms.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              The cost sharing for the project will be 54% of the NSF portion.
