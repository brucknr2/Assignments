Abstract    :
              The project provides a fresh approach to the design and quality                
              issues which relate to U.S. competitiveness.  The approach involves            
              adding a new introductory course to the undergraduate curriculum               
              which teaches that quality must start at the initial design level.             
              This course is multidisciplinary, transcends traditional                       
              disciplinary boundaries, and unifies and focuses all aspects of                
              design on high quality and low cost.  Such a course imparts the key            
              role of "Quality Through Design" at the freshman level and serves              
              as a unified foundation for further undergraduate and graduate                 
              studies.
