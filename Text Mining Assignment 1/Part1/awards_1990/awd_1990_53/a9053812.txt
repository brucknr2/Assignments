Abstract    :
              The coalition includes seven institutions (the City College of New             
              York, Howard University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology,                
              University of Maryland, Morgan State University, Pennsylvania State            
              University, and University of Washington) and has a twofold gold:              
              1) to increase the quality of U.S. engineering education and to                
              increase the number of engineering graduates at all levels,                    
              especially among women and underrepresented minorities, 2) to                  
              increase the effectiveness of engineering education, fostering a               
              curriculum renewal that prepares students for life-long productive             
              careers.  Central to the realization of these goals is the                     
              integration, throughout the curriculum, of design, broadly                     
              conceived -- that is, of engineering design in all its diversity,              
              from technical to social dimensions -- and the development of                  
              programs to attract and retain women and underrepresented                      
              minorities in engineering.  The grantee provides funds for this                
              project that are more than an equal match for the NSF award.
