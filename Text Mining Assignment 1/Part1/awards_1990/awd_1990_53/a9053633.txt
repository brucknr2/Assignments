Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Produce an exhibition that will lead visitors,                            
              particularly 140,000 school children each year, to explore and                 
              understand modern audio technology.  The exhibition capitalizes                
              on the great popularity of recorded music (every student seems                 
              to carry a Walkman tape or disc player), to encourage hands-on                 
              exploration of audio technologies from microphones to compact                  
              disc players.  Further visitor inquiry, using a computer-based                 
              system developed by the Hall of Science, will encourage an                     
              understanding of the underlying principles.  The prototype of                  
              this "Science Link" system, now in use, has already drawn                      
              replication inquiries from 84 science-technology centers,                      
              educational institutions, and advertising agencies.                            
                                                                                             
                   Develop additional exhibit techniques that will allow the                 
              hands-on investigation of phenomena that cannot be directly                    
              observed.  Techniques linking computer simulations directly to                 
              the physical exhibits will encourage investigation of phenomena                
              that cannot be directly observed.  While contemporary                          
              electronic technology has become more and more pervasive, its                  
              inner workings have become less and less accessible to the                     
              layman.  In addressing audio technology as typical of this                     
              challenge, the project will have applications to many                          
              fundamental and applied topics, and will find wide use in                      
              science centers and other settings.
