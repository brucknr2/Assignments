Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Anchorage Science/Technology Alliance Project aims to improve              
              precollege science education for the 40,000 students in its                    
              district.  The project will work in five program areas: (1)                    
              coordination, communication, outreach, and planning; (2)                       
              internships for teachers; (3) a Scientists in Schools program;                 
              (4) review, synthesis, and dissemination of curricula; and (5) a               
              cross.training program to provide access to educators to                       
              technical and management seminars and to open professional                     
              development training in the School District to people from the                 
              Alliance.  An outcome of the project will be the establishment of              
              a statewide network for science and technology education.
