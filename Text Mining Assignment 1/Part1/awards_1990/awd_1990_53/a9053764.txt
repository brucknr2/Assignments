Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Indiana University of Pennsylvania will develop a model                        
              laboratory course on computers and computer interfacing for                    
              middle and secondary science education majors.  The project                    
              will extend activities developed by the in-service computer                    
              interfacing workshops at the University to pre-service                         
              teacher preparation.  The computer applications will cover                     
              all fields of science including biology, chemistry, physics,                   
              and earth science.  Curricular materials and videotapes will                   
              be produced by the project for national dissemination.  The                    
              University's cost sharing will be 64% of NSF's contribution.
