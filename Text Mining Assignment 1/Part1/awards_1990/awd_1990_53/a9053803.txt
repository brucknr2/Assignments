Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  San Diego State University will create a learning environment             
              in the physics and biology courses for elementary teachers that                
              facilitates conceptual understanding of scientific phenomena.  The             
              classroom environment will utilize computer and videodisc learning             
              tools to help students construct and monitor their own scientific              
              knowledge.  The products to be produced by the project are: A) a               
              metacognitive skills workbook; B) skeletal semantic networks in                
              physics and biology for use in teaching students to think about                
              the links between observation, evidence, and interpretation; C)                
              videodisc-based tutorials in several areas of physics; D) a                    
              videodisc of physics and biology images relevant to classroom                  
              activities; and E) strategies for teaching prospective elementary              
              teachers for conceptual understanding.  The University's cost                  
              sharing will be 14% of NSF's contribution.
