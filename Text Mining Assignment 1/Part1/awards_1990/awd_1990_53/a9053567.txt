Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This one year project, sponsored by the University of Wisconsin                
              Madison and called the Assessment and Coordination of Math and                 
              Science Related Industrial Internship Programs for Secondary                   
              School Teachers, is a program to place 20 outstanding science                  
              teachers of minority students in internships in local businesses               
              and industries so that they will have an opportunity to                        
              experience actually doing science and technology. The intern                   
              program is supplemented by lectures on science and there are                   
              follow-through projects to aid in the implementation of the                    
              summer experience in the classroom.  Altogether the teachers will              
              spend eight weeks during the summer in lectures and at work.                   
              Because the academic/industrial internship model has been so                   
              successful and holds such great promise for the future, the                    
              University proposes to expand the teacher/internship experience                
              by working to replicate the program on a national basis.  A                    
              national teachers/internship program planning conference will be               
              organized to find out the nature of support for expanding the                  
              project into a nation-wide effort.                                             
                                                                                             
              The NSF share of the project cost is $109,580 which is being                   
              matched by $145,000 from other sources.  This is a cost share of               
              more than 132%.
