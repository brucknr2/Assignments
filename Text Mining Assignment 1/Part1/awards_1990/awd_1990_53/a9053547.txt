Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Institute for Science Instruction and Study (ISIS) will                    
              associate experienced science teachers from Connecticut                        
              (including minority teachers and teachers of minorities) with                  
              research scientists who are working at the frontiers of                        
              knowledge in their fields.  Seminars, weekend workshops,                       
              field site visits, summer programs, and mentorships will                       
              introduce the teachers to every aspect of the scientific                       
              research process.  Since the teachers will be intimately                       
              involved in ongoing scientific work, they will be identified                   
              as ISIS Fellows.  Through ISIS, Fellows will learn to                          
              interact with the scientific community personally and                          
              intellectually.  By experiencing real and recent science,                      
              teacher participants will be scientifically remotivated to                     
              acquire an enriched knowledge of science, technology, and                      
              social values.  Through the sharing of experiences with other                  
              ISIS Fellows, and interaction with participating scientists,                   
              they will become more skilled and dynamic in their teaching.                   
              The result will be teachers with renewed self-images and                       
              increased levels of confidence in their science-related                        
              abilities.  ISIS Fellows will form a cadre of scientifically-                  
              informed teachers who will become leaders in their school                      
              districts.  Their ability to provide leadership will be                        
              enhanced by the guarantee of support from their school                         
              administration and continued access to ISIS resources.                         
                                                                                             
              An amount equivalent to 42.6% of the NSF award is being                        
              contributed as cost-sharing.
