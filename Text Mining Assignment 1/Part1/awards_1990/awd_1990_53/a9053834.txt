              This 2-year project at Howard University's Institute for                       
              Science, Space and Technology will conduct activities aimed at                 
              (1) improving the quality of science teaching in area high                     
              schools and (2) increasing the number of minority students who                 
              elect to major and pursue a career in the sciences and                         
              engineering.  Those activities include an extensive role for                   
              minority scientists and engineers and minority public officials                
              "to communicate the importance of science and mathematics                      
              education to African-American parents and students," the                       
              planning and execution of two summer science academies (one for                
              teachers and one for students), and recognition of science
