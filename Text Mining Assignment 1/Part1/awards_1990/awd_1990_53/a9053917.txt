Abstract    :
              The University of Michigan College of Engineering, Center for the              
              Education of Women, and Women in Science Program will collaborate              
              in this model project.  The goal is to increase the number of women            
              in academic research and related careers in engineering.  Fifty                
              sophomore women will be selected and given a two year training                 
              program of seminars, internships, and symposia to prepare them for             
              graduate school, or employment as engineers.  Women graduate                   
              students in engineering will serve as role model-presentors for                
              the seminars.  The symposia will provide a forum for presentation              
              and discussion of research findings and matters related to                     
              preparations for graduate school.  The project has strong financial            
              support from the University and from industry.//
