Abstract    :
                   The Connecticut Business and Industry Association                         
              (CBIA), in partnership with the Hartford Public schools,                       
              area colleges and universities, and business and industry,                     
              with support of the National Science Foundation is                             
              conducting a 3-year project to revitalize the secondary                        
              General Mathematics program.  The activities proposed are                      
              intended to revise the curriculum, promote the professional                    
              development of secondary mathematics teachers, and devise                      
              new approaches to mathematics education.  The general                          
              strategy is to create a core of selected members of the                        
              partnership who will be responsible for guiding the work of                    
              the project.  Fifty secondary school mathematics teachers                      
              and 20 high school mathematics students will be actively                       
              involved in the project each year.  Among the devices                          
              proposed is the use of business and industry members for                       
              inservice education (i.e., industrial applications of                          
              mathematics) and the creation of a Student Internship                          
              Program
