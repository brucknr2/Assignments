Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project of the Technical Center of Silicon Valley                         
              establishes an interactive, exploratory science and technology                 
              program for secondary students and teachers.  The program                      
              includes interactive exhibits that present current technological               
              innovation and application, interaction with industry experts,                 
              and hands-on experience with lab equipment.                                    
                                                                                             
              Fifty middle and high school teachers from eight local districts               
              will participate in a summer workshop with industry experts from               
              five fields that relate to the interactive exhibits.  Each of                  
              these teachers will prepare three to five colleagues to                        
              participate in the Center.  Over 14,000 students will benefit                  
              from the program.  //
