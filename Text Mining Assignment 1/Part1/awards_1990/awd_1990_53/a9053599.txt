Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This exploratory research project will study the feasibility of a              
              major national initiative to change the standard practice of                   
              staff development in the United States.  Current reform movements              
              call for teachers to take on new responsibilities for school                   
              decision making and instructional leadership and then to be held               
              accountable for student outcomes.  Our teachers must, therefore,               
              be provided with opportunities to advance their understanding of               
              subject matter and to build collegial networks in support of                   
              their efforts.  A shift to this new view of staff development                  
              will require broadscale changes in policy, practice, and public                
              opinion.  As a first step, this study will address a number of                 
              unanswered questions about the nature and extent of the dominant               
              paradigm of staff development and about the interest and                       
              commitment of individuals or organizations whose attention to the              
              issues of staff development is a necessary ingredient for future               
              success.  The study should have two important results: 1) It will              
              provide a much more accurate picture of the dimensions of the                  
              problems surrounding the funding, organization, and delivery of                
              staff development in mathematics and science, and 2) It will lead              
              to greater understanding of and investment in the issues related               
              to the reform of staff development in the United States.
