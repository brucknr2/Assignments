Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project, "Inservice Teacher Training in Environmental Education",         
              aims at training 400 Wisconsin K-12 educators to teach environmental           
              education (EE) in all areas of the school curriculum.  It also aims at         
              increasing the amount of instructional time spent teaching EE by these         
              400 teachers to a minimum of 5 hours per week.  This unique model of           
              inservice teacher training is developed and implemented as a pilot             
              program by the College of Natural Resources.  The project duration is 12       
              months, and the cost sharing is 27 percent of the amount requested from        
              National Science Foundation.                                                   
                                                                                             
              The teacher preparation provides instruction on the goals of EE;               
              provides opportunities to acquire and apply the knowledge, skills and          
              attitudes inherent in EE; provides participatory and practice-based            
              training in the methods as well as the content of EE instructional             
              materials; provides training in using the classroom and the school yard        
              as sites for EE; and provides motivation for teachers from all                 
              backgrounds and grade levels to teach EE.                                      
                                                                                             
              The teachers are selected from the 481 school districts and 2002 public        
              schools in the state of Wisconsin. Specific encouragement is given to          
              women, minorities, and disabled persons to participate. A series of four       
              courses are offered, starting in the summer of 1990, the second and            
              third in early 1991, and the fourth in the summer of 1991. Subsequently,       
              there will be teacher evaluation student evaluation, and material              
              dissemination throughout the state.
