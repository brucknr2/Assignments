Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Pennsylvania State University intends to provide                           
              teachers a comprehensive educational program on radiation                      
              and nuclear science topics.  At least 36 teachers per year,                    
              for three years, will be involved in an intense summer                         
              course.  In addition, there will be two follow-up sessions                     
              for prior years' participants, and local or regional                           
              programs on nuclear science topics.  In order to develop                       
              further the network there will be an Industry/Education                        
              Advisory Committee which will seek to increase accessibility                   
              of real-life science and engineering applications to the                       
              classroom and to increase student interest in science and                      
              engineering as a career choice.  In order to bring new                         
              emphasis to minorities and women in science and engineering,                   
              the project willwork with Penn State's Director for                            
              Minorities in Engineering and the Director of Women in                         
              Engineering programs.
