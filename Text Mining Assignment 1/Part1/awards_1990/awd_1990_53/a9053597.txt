Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The research study will describe in fine detail the                       
              mathematical behavior of individual children drawn from                        
              classrooms where mathematics is taught through problem-                        
              solving activities Questions to be addressed include how                       
              each child develops meaning for mathematical ideas and                         
              procedures and makes connections within and among                              
              representations; the obstacles to understanding that are                       
              created; and how mathematical behaviors develop over time.                     
                                                                                             
                   The research includes the analysis of videotapes of                       
              small group problem-solving activities within actual                           
              classroom settings, and individual task-based interviews in                    
              grades three through six.                                                      
                                                                                             
                   The study will be conducted in three school districts                     
              in New Jersey: urban, blue-collar working-class, and upper                     
              middle-class suburban.                                                         
                                                                                             
                   The videotapes and accompanying analyses will be                          
              developed in trial usuage for pre- and in-service teacher                      
              education programs at Rutgers and subsequently refined for                     
              more wide-spread dissemination.  The results of this study                     
              have important implications for teacher preparation and                        
              development and instruction in a variety of school settings.                   
                                                                                             
                   This project is jointly supported by the Division of                      
              Teacher Preparation and Enhancement and the Division of
