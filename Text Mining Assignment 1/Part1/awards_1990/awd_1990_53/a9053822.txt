Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Wichita State University (WSU) is leading a partnership                        
              comprising Unified School District 259 (USD) and                               
              Wichita/Sedgewick County Partnership for Growth (WI/SE).  The                  
              partnership proposes to use existing private sector and                        
              educational relationships and networks to develop and pilot                    
              integrated instructional packages in 4 target USD 259 schools                  
              over a 4-year period. Private sector technical personnel will be               
              involved in planning and providing instruction.  After                         
              evaluation, these units will be disseminated throughout school                 
              systems in the country and made available nationally.                          
                                                                                             
              Anticipated results include: (1) integration of private sector                 
              technical personnel in projects to improve science and                         
              mathematics education, (2) integration of current applications                 
              of science and mathematics into course content, (3) improvement                
              of science and mathematics teaching, (4) improved science and                  
              mathematics learning among all student populations in local                    
              schools, and (5) involvement in science and mathematics learning               
              and improved performance by students from population segments                  
              traditionally underserved in technically-based careers.
