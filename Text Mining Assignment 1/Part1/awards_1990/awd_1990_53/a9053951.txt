Abstract    :
              Abstract:  This project represents a coalition of Howard University,           
              the University of the District of Columbia, the DC Public Schools              
              (DCPS), several corporations and community organizations.  The goal            
              of the project is to facilitate system-wide assessment and                     
              intervention programs for students and teachers in the DCPS in                 
              science and mathematics at all grade levels.                                   
                                                                                             
              A unique methodology in the program is the adaptation of learning              
              styles to cultural background.  Each member of the Center is already           
              substantially involved, formally or informally, in relationships with          
              the DC Public School system.  The superintendent has affirmed that             
              the goals of the Center are consonant with the long range plans of             
              the school system.                                                             
                                                                                             
              The presidents of the universities have committed their instructors            
              to support and sustain the Center's activities.                                
                                                                                             
              The program components will be three types:  academics, teacher-               
              training, and community-based; the latter includes technical                   
              assistance to organization for in-school and after-school science and          
              mathematics activities, tutoring, forums, apprenticeships, and peer-           
              liaison.
