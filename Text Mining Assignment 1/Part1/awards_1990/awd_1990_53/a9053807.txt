Abstract    :
              The coalition includes eight institutions (Cal Poly, San Luis                  
              Obispo, Cornell University, Hampton University, Iowa State                     
              University, Southern University, Stanford University, Tuskegee                 
              University, University of California, Berkeley) and has a twofold              
              goal:  1) to increase the quality of U.S. engineering education and            
              to increase the number of engineering graduates at all levels,                 
              especially among women and underrepresented minorities, 2) to                  
              improve the effectiveness of engineering education so as to enhance            
              the quality of the graduates and their effectiveness in industry.              
              The coalition develops, experiments with, and evaluates the                    
              effectiveness of a variety of innovative curricula, delivery                   
              systems, settings, and pedagogies.  In addition, to attract and                
              retain increased number of engineering students, the coalition                 
              undertakes intensive activities aimed at improving the image of                
              engineering as a field of study and as a profession.  The grantee              
              provides funds for this project that are more than an equal match              
              for the NSF award.
