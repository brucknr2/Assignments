Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A mentoring network linking college science, mathematics, and                  
              engineering students with grade 4-8 urban students in                          
              Philadelphia has been successfully established on a pilot                      
              basis.  This project will build on the pilot and will                          
              increase the emphasis on participation in the network by                       
              school science teachers and by science faculty from the                        
              University of Pennsylvania. The focus of the mentoring                         
              network is an intervention model in science and mathematics                    
              education which includes classroom and after-school                            
              activities. Mentors engage students in hands-on activities in                  
              non-threatening and fun learning environments and work with                    
              pupils and teachers to form science clubs, participate in                      
              science fairs, and embark on a variety of field trips.  An                     
              important part of this project is a research component  which                  
              will be used to evaluate the monitoring network model and to                   
              build and maintain a data base to be used for further                          
              studies. Cost sharing in the amount of $18,504 is 3% of the                    
              NSF contribution to this project.
