Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project examines the development of students' schemes for                 
              multiplication and multiplicative rate of change that will enable              
              students to understand the crucial societal and environmental issues of        
              exponential growth.  Through the use of teaching experiments, historical       
              analysis and the design of software incorporating new representational         
              and visual forms, the research team seeks to investigate how to improve        
              students' insight in issues of scale, functions, multiplicative rate of        
              change and biological forms of growth.  To facilitate the research on          
              secondary students, preliminary work will be undertaken into young             
              children's concepts of multiplication, similarity and growth in relation       
              to a primitive construct labelled "splitting" which is conjectured to be       
              the basis of an approach to multiplication independent of counting.            
              Initial studies will also include an ethnomathematical investigation of        
              scientists' and social scientists' use of exponential functions.               
              Informed by the interview studies, research on whole classroom                 
              implementation will be undertaken towards the preparation of applied           
              research products including curricula, case studies of teacher                 
              development and software products.
