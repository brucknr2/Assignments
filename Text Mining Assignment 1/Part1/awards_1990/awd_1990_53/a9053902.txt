Abstract    :
              This project involves Westminister College, two local school                   
              districts, the Utah Mathematics/Science Network, and the University            
              of Utah.  The Network was formed by a group of women scientists                
              from Utah schools, universities, and industry to increase awareness            
              of career opportunities in science, to encourage young women to                
              enter those fields, and to provide a support structure for them.               
              Beginning in the fall of 1990, a group of high school teachers will            
              begin developing supplementary materials, for their classes based              
              on lectures in a seminar series conducted by the Utah Math/Science             
              Network.  The materials will be further developed, by selected                 
              University faculty and students, for a special summer course.  In              
              the spring of 1991, 12 female students who will be entering the                
              University of Utah and who have expressed an interest in a career              
              in mathematics or physical science shall be selected for the                   
              program.   All participating students will take a course during the            
              summer on the dynamical processes of chemistry and physics.  After             
              15 months of special instruction and training, the 12 students will            
              become active research participants.  It is intended that 12 new               
              students and 3 new high school teachers will be selected in 1992               
              to begin a second cycle of the program.  Special two day strategy              
              sessions for teachers will be held on alternate Saturdays in                   
              September to discuss ways of neutralizing gender bias and to                   
              provide a forum for developing ad discussing effective methods of              
              outreach.  The foci of the program are recruitment and retention.
