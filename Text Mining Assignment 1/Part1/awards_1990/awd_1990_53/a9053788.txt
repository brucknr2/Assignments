Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The ShareNet partnership will join the University of Kansas,                   
              fifty-three school districts from the metropolitan Kansas City                 
              area, and the Silicon Prairie Technology Association.  The                     
              partnership will use technology to provide staff development for               
              teachers, with the ultimate goal of enhancing the science                      
              literacy of students.  A database of curriculum and instructional              
              resources will be created and made accessible through network                  
              technology.
