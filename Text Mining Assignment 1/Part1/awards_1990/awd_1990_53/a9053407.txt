Abstract    :
              A calculus video appplications library is being produced that will             
              expose students to exciting applications of mathematics and will               
              include a printed teacher's guide.  The modules can also be used               
              in faculty development activities and will contain print packages              
              with special attention to showing how to introduce these ideas into            
              the classroom.
