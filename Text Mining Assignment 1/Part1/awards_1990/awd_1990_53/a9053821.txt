Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Bellcore project, "Heightened Interest in Technical and                    
              Engineering Careers (HI-TEC)," refines and replicates a project                
              that has been underway in six New Jersey school districts since                
              1989.  Forty teachers from fourteen schools have joined                        
              engineers, scientists, and administrators in planning and                      
              attending a 20-day summer math, science, computer and learning                 
              innovation institute.  In the fall, the scientists will join the               
              teachers in the classroom.  Computer links will enable students                
              to obtain answers to questions about science.  The target group                
              is elementary and middle school teachers, with a focus on women                
              and minorities.
