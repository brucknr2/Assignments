Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is a program of activities and experiences for                    
              students in grades K-6, particularly disabled and limited                      
              English Proficiency students, with a focus on encouraging                      
              disabled students to pursue studies leading to technological                   
              careers.  It provides opportunities for disabled scientists to                 
              serve as role models for disabled students, and helps all                      
              students and teachers overcome biases against disabled people.                 
              It also encourages teachers and administrators to work together                
              to make decisions concerning their schools' science programs.                  
                                                                                             
              By the end of the 2-year program, 60 disabled scientists,                      
              engineers and technicians will have attended one of two 150-hour               
              training institutes, and have developed conceptual, multimodal                 
              science lessons, which they will have presented to various                     
              combinations of teachers and students in at least 40 elementary                
              schools. Each school will have received approximately 50 hours-                
              per-year of Scientists' teaching time.  Teachers and principals                
              will have worked together to determine how, when, by whom, and                 
              to whom the lessons will be presented.  The second year expands                
              the number of Scientists and lessons and permits teachers and                  
              principals involved in the first year to participate in                        
              improving all                                                                  
              elements of the program.
