Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Trek of the Mammoth is a three-week multidisciplinary                      
              K-12 science educators' summer workshop based on a thematic                    
              unit about mammoths.  The Trek incorporates field study in a                   
              unique rural geographical region with classroom materials                      
              development.  Participants will study topics in field                          
              biology, environmental science and earth science with a major                  
              emphasis in science processes and cooperative learning                         
              groups.  During the Trek teachers will have an opportunity to                  
              observe actual scientists in the field doing research and to                   
              create specimen collections of their own.  In addition,                        
              participants will study Lakota ethno-botany and                                
              ethno-astronomy and Lakota culture and beliefs, along with                     
              the special educational needs of all minorities.  Follow-up                    
              activities during the school year include a "Video pen pal                     
              network" for classrooms, a Science Fun Day and a Prehistoric                   
              Hunters of the High Plains olympiad.  Phase II is a                            
              three-year implementation program based on an NSF-funded                       
              one-year pilot Trek.  The Trek is designed to meet the needs                   
              of teachers who traditionally work with underserved and                        
              under-represented students including Native Americans,                         
              Hispanics and rural people.                                                    
                                                                                             
              An amount equivalent to 102% of the NSF contribution is                        
              included as cost-sharing.
