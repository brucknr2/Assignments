Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              This project of the Association of Science-Technology Centers                  
              (ASTC) is a three-year program to enhance the knowledge and                    
              skills of teacher educators in science and technology centers                  
              and museums nationally.  In turn, these teacher educators                      
              will use what they learn to improve their own teaching of                      
              children, and the inservice and professional development                       
              programs which they now offer to elementary school teachers.                   
              The program will work extensively with 90 teacher educators                    
              in teams of two or three over a three year period.  Summer                     
              institutes will be taught by some of the country's most                        
              outstanding teacher educators and research scholars in the                     
              fields of learning, teacher education, and multicultural                       
              education.  Through the networking capabilities of ASTC and                    
              regular yearly meetings, these science educators will support                  
              each other as they plan and engage in local projects designed                  
              to improve the teaching of science at the elementary level.                    
              As a result of this program, as many as 9,000 classroom                        
              teachers may have access to high quality professional                          
              development opportunities, which better equip them to                          
              implement inquiry-based science instruction.  The cost                         
              sharing for the project will be fifty five percent of the NSF                  
              portion.
