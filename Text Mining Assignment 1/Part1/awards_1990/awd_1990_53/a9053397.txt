Abstract    :
              Students are learning calculus in a discovery-based laboratory                 
              course using materials developed at Duke University and adapted for            
              use in a liberal arts college setting.  The course and laboratory              
              materials are made available for Macintosh computers and exploit               
              the Notebook feature of the computer algebra system Mathematica.
