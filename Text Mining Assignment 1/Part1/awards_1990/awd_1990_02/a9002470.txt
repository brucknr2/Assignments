Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The principal investigator will use analysis to study                     
              Sobolev connections.  Furthermore, the study of singularities in               
              gauge fields will be extended to arbitrary compact Lie groups and              
              to more general singular sets of codimension-two.  Lastly, the                 
              Morse theory of hyperbolic monopoles will be investigated and                  
              related to that of instantons on the four-sphere.                              
                   This project involves the use of advanced analysis to                     
              understand aspects of modern mathematical physics.  In many                    
              respects this is a golden era in the technical interaction                     
              between physics and the mathematical areas of differential                     
              geometry and partial differential equations.  This interplay,                  
              which goes back to Einstein and Gauss, was recently intensified                
              by work of Donaldson who showed that our four-dimensional space-               
              time could have different shape than earlier assumed.
