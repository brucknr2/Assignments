Abstract    :
                   This award will provide 54% of the cost of acquiring a                    
              superconducting rock magnetometer and thermal demagnetizer system              
              for use in paleomagnetic research in earth sciences. The                       
              instrument system will be operated and maintained in the                       
              Department of Geology at the University of Florida-Gainesville.                
              The University is committed to providing the remaining 46% funds               
              required.                                                                      
                   The acquisition of this new system will constitute a major                
              upgrade of capabilities for the paleomagnetics laboratory at the               
              University of Florida and will allow the group to engage in                    
              research on magnetization in small cores and channel cores to                  
              study the diagenesis of iron minerals in sediments and for                     
              detailed magnetostratigraphic studies.
