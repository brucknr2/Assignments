Abstract    :
                   Professor Kraus will investigate some questions concerning                
              tensor products and approximation properties of weakly closed                  
              subspaces of the algebra of bounded operators on a Hilbert space,              
              and some similar questions for operator spaces.  In particular,                
              he will investigate the problem of whether all CSL algebras have               
              a certain weak approximation property which guarantees that the                
              algebras behave well under tensoring.  Other projects involve the              
              study of the class of groups whose associated von Neumann                      
              algebras have this approximation property, and the study of other              
              related approximation properties.                                              
                   This project involves the study of operators on Hilbert                   
              spaces.  Hilbert space operators are essentially infinite                      
              matrices of complex numbers.  These operators have applications                
              in every area of applied science as well as in pure mathematics.               
              This research is an attempt to understand how algebras of these                
              operators acting on independent Hilbert spaces behave when they                
              are combined by taking the tensor product of these spaces.
