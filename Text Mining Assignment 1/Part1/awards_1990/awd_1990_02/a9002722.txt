Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a SGER project to collect and to study the perishable                  
              earthquake and structural response/damage earthquake.                          
                                                                                             
              This project focuses on the unique opportunity provided to                     
              collect data of building damage and to calibrate and validate                  
              loss estimation models/buildings and a portfolio of buildings.                 
                                                                                             
              The study will use 400 Stanford University buildings as a                      
              portfolio which cover a broad spectrum of structural and                       
              material types.  This massive portfolio of old and modern                      
              buildings, which collectively suffered a total loss of $160                    
              million offers a superb data base to improve the damage/loss                   
              evaluation and estimation techniques.  The tasks entailed in                   
              this project are: (1) collection of factual damage data of                     
              structural and architectural mature,                                           
              (2) collection of soil dnad geological data of building sites,                 
                                                                                             
              (3) collection of strong-motion from campus sites, and                         
              (4) evaluation of damage and loss and calibration of models                    
              used.                                                                          
                                                                                             
              The results could be representative for many buildings in                      
              California and other states and the learning about existing                    
              models will be of significant value to many large                              
              institutions, corporations and communities.
