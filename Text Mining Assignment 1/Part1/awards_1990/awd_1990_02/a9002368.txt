Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Funds are provided for continued activities of Ocean Studies                   
              Board of the National Research Council in the planning of the                  
              Continental Margins initiative. The planning is being undertaken               
              through a committee under the Ocean Studies Board and Board on                 
              Earth Science and Resources of the NRC. An earlier workshop                    
              recognized the need to identify research issue on the margins                  
              that are process oriented and interdisciplinary in order to                    
              further the understanding of lithospheric convergence and                      
              divergence. Funds will be used for workshops to be held under the              
              NRC aegis in late 1990 and 1991 for further planning and                       
              completion of a Science and Operational Plans. The cost of                     
              workshops will be shared by NSF, NOAA, USGS and ONR. Half of the               
              funds are provided by NSF.
