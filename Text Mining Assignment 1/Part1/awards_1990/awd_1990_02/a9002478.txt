Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal is to make helium measurements on the World                      
              Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) cruises in the central                     
              Pacific on longitude 150 west.  The helium data are useful as                  
              tracers of the deep ocean circulation, particularly in regions                 
              near the east Pacific rise from which elemental helium is known                
              to emanate.  These measurements, along with hydrographic and                   
              other tracer measurements will form the basis for ocean                        
              circulation descriptions and models which are the principal                    
              objectives of WOCE.
