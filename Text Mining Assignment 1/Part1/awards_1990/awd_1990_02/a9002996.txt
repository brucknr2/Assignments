Abstract    :
              With support from the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program,                 
              Professor Nathanson is studying the gas-liquid interface by                    
              scattering molecular beams from liquid surfaces.  His group is                 
              studying the local roughness and rigidity of the surface and                   
              the effect of solvent molecules on solvation, surface                          
              adsorption, and surface chemistry.                                             
                                                                                             
              Under vacuum conditions that suppress collisions in the vapor                  
              above the surface, Nathanson uses time-of-flight spectroscopy                  
              to measure the details of scattering and adsorption-desorption                 
              of individual solute molecules striking the liquid surface.                    
              Inert gases and protic solutes such as water and ammonia are                   
              being scattered from hydrophobic, hydrogen-bonding, and acidic                 
              liquids to learn how the incident collision energy and angle of                
              approach of the impinging beam control adsorption, solvation,                  
              and proton exchange at the interface.
