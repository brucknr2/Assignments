Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research program is part of the                                           
              initiative to collect perishable data                                          
              resulting from the 17 October 1989 Northern                                    
              California (Loma Prieta) earthquake.                                           
                                                                                             
              The objective is to obtain data on soil                                        
              failures in the Marina District of San                                         
              Francisco: this perishable data will be                                        
              analyzed at a later date with the objective                                    
              of developing a simple and efficient                                           
              technique to assess the stability and                                          
              displacement of liquefied soils.                                               
                                                                                             
              The observations are designed to provide data                                  
              on ground failures which can lead to answers                                   
              to the following questions:                                                    
              1. Are sand boils related to the damage                                        
              caused by liquefaction?                                                        
              2. Do the sand boils in the Marina District                                    
              form a pattern or are they randomly                                            
              distributed?                                                                   
              3. Is there a relation between the                                             
              superficial ground displacement, soil profile                                  
              and the size of the sand boils, their                                          
              relative spatial frequency and distribution?                                   
              4. Is it possible to reconstruct the failure                                   
              mechanisms within soil layers by examining                                     
              the sand boils?
