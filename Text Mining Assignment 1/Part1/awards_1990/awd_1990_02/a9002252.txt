Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will continue his work in                      
              Martingale theory, which impacts both probability and harmonic                 
              analysis.  In particular, Burkholder will study square-function                
              subordination of martingales, martingales and systems of                       
              nonlinear partial differential inequalities, and optimal control               
              of martingales.
