Abstract    :
                   The investigator intends to focus on classifying certain                  
              kinds of manifolds using a combination of geometric methods and                
              stable homotopy theory.  In particular, he would like to find                  
              necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of positive              
              scalar curvature metrics, and give a diffeomorphism                            
              classification of Dupin hypersurfaces and complete intersections.              
              Classification of manifolds with nice geometric properties is as               
              old as the Greeks.  Here the properties under consideration are                
              more modern, but the basic idea is much the same.
