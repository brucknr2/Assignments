Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This U.S.-Brazil Science and Technology Initiative (STI) award                 
              will support a program planning workshop in the area of algebraic              
              geometry.  The purpose of the workshop, organized by Professor                 
              Steven Kleiman of MIT and Professor Felipe Voloch of IMPA, Rio de              
              Janeiro, is to stimulate cooperative research between U.S. and                 
              Brazilian mathematicians.  As such, the workshop will try to                   
              address the following topics: diagnostic of on-going research                  
              efforts in both the U.S. and Brazil in the area of algebraic                   
              geometry; identification of areas of common interests and likely               
              future collaborators; and organization of joint planning activities            
              for cooperation in the short, medium, and long term.
