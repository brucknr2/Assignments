Abstract    :
                   This proposal is to deploy a suite of current meter moorings              
              in the Pacific Ocean near New Zealand to measure the influx of                 
              deep waters into the Pacific Basin.  The meters will be recovered              
              after two years.  In association with the mooring, hydrographic                
              and tracer data will be collected.  The work is coordinated with               
              proposals by Nowlin (8917338) and Warren (9002708) and the New                 
              Zealand Oceanographic Institution.   It is a component of the                  
              World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE).
