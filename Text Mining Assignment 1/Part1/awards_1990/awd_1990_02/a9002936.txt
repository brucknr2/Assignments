Abstract    :
                   To obtain useful predictions beyond a few days requires that              
              both cloudiness and radiation processes be accurately represented              
              in a numerical weather prediction model.  Since it is not                      
              possible to represent all physical processes on all scales                     
              explicitly, it is necessary to use physically based sub-grid                   
              scale parameterizations.  The goal of this project is to evaluate              
              the current cloud generation and radiation schemes used in the                 
              National Meteorological Center (NMC)'s operational global model                
              and to evaluate the sensitivity of forecasts to those schemes.                 
              Based on the analyses, the PI will suggest improvements to the                 
              schemes.  The results of this study should be relevant for                     
              climate as well as weather models.                                             
                   This project is part of a joint program in numerical weather              
              prediction sponsored by NSF and NOAA's NMC.  The principal                     
              investigator and his colleagues will work closely with NMC staff               
              during the research.
