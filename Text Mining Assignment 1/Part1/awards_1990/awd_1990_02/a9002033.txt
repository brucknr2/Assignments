Abstract    :
              This research will develop new computational methods and software              
              for determining the conformation states and kinematic behavior of              
              mobile molecules by means of geometric reasoning.  The resultant               
              computer programs are expected to be of value to researchers in                
              many areas of structural chemistry and biochemistry, including                 
              spectroscopists who wish to interpret their data in terms of a                 
              precise molecular model, stereochemists who need to find all the               
              conformers consistent with a given bonding arrangement, and                    
              molecular biologists attempting to predict protein and nucleic acid            
              conformation.  Because a wide variety of information concerning the            
              structure of molecules can be encoded in terms of constraints on               
              their interatomic distances, our first goal is to improve our                  
              understanding of and ability to reason directly with these                     
              constraints.  The next goal is to devise more efficient and                    
              reliable methods of finding atomic coordinates compatible with the             
              constraints, and determining what motions are consistent with them.            
              The final goal is to develop a user-friendly, window-oriented                  
              interface that enables one to visually prepare the input, perform              
              the computations, and analyze their results graphically.
