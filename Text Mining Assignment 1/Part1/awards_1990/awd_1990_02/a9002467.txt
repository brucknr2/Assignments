Abstract    :
                   The contractor will carry out a national opinion survey                   
              to measure the attitudes of the U.S. adult public toward science               
              and technology.  Data will be collected by telephone during the                
              summer of 1990 using a multistage probability sample of about                  
              2,000 respondents.  Some questions will continue data series                   
              previously collected for NSF, while others will introduce new                  
              topical areas.  Some questions will also be designed to be used                
              in conjunction with similar surveys in other countries.                        
                    NSF has been collecting data in this area since 1972.  The               
              data have been used primarily in the biennial series Science and               
              Engineering Indicators, though research papers have also                       
              appeared.  These materials have provided valuable insights into                
              public thinking about science and technology issues, and thereby               
              have helped inform discussions of such issues.
