Abstract    :
              Understanding room air and air contaminant distribution is                     
              essential to the design of a ventilation system and the control of             
              room thermal and air quality conditions.                                       
                                                                                             
              The objectives of the proposal are:                                            
                                                                                             
                   (1)  Investigate the regional airflow characteristic of a                 
                        realistic ventilated room, especially with obstructions,             
                        with heat sources, with both obstructions and heat                   
                        sources, and under low turbulence airflow conditions.                
                                                                                             
                   (2)  Develop a method for scaling among different sized rooms.            
                                                                                             
                   (3)  Evaluate and improve existing numerical                              
                        simulation models to predict the air and air contaminant             
                        distribution in ventilated rooms under realistic                     
                        situations.                                                          
                                                                                             
                   (4)  Provide experimental data for the analysis and evaluation            
                        of theoretically-based models of room air and air                    
                        contaminant distribution in ventilated rooms.
