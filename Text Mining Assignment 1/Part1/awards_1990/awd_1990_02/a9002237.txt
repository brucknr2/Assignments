Abstract    :
                    Computational Statistics is emerging as an important area                
              in its own right, focussing on the development of statistical                  
              methodology which could not exist outside of the framework of                  
              modern computing resources.  This research activity will focus on              
              three principal areas which include the visualization of high                  
              dimensional structures, modern nonparametric statistical                       
              inference methods for high dimensional data and computational                  
              algorithms related to these methods.  Specifically:  Three                     
              dimensional Andrews and related plots; The grand tour in three                 
              dimensions;  Data set mapping; Finding structure in k-dimensions               
              using grand tour and parallel coordinates; Nonparametric density               
              estimation in high inference using ridge estimation in                         
              hyperspace; and Computational algorithms for generalized                       
              nonparametric function estimation.
