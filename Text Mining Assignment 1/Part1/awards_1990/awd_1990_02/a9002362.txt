Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to study automated reasoning in elementary         
              geometry, differential geometry, and mechanics as an extension of our          
              previous and current work.  It covers not only theorem proving, but            
              also formula derivation.  In each of these three areas, the following          
              research will be conducted:  (1) to improve existing proving                   
              techniques; (2) To further study mechanical formula derivation; (3) to         
              collect a significant number of worked examples; (4) to improve Ritt-          
              Wu's decomposition algorithm and other key algorithms; (5) to combine          
              Ritt-Wu's method with Collins' method in elementary geometry; (6) to           
              release an automated reasoning system; (7) to study practical                  
              applications of our techniques to areas such as kinematic synthesis of         
              linkages and mechanisms, CAD/CAM, etc; (8) to study theoretical issues         
              related to our techniques.
