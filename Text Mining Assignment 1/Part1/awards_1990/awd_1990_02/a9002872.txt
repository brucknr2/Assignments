Abstract    :
              The Antarctic is now experiencing large springtime losses of                   
              stratospheric ozone, resulting in an increase in ultraviolet B                 
              (UVB, 280-320nm) radiation.  The magnitude of ultraviolet                      
              radiation reaching the surface now approaches that measured in                 
              tropical latitudes. Perhaps more importantly, UVB radiation has                
              increased in the Antarctic while both UVA (320-400nm) and                      
              photosynthetically available radiation (PAR, 400-700nm) have                   
              remained unchanged.  Recent improvements in atmospheric modeling               
              and technology in oceanographic instrumentation will be used in a              
              six week field study during the austral spring 1990.  The prime                
              objective will be to document the impact of UV radiation on the                
              phytoplankton community during the ice-edge spring bloom.  During              
              this time, oceanographic processes create favorable conditions                 
              for increased UVB susceptibility.  Biological and bio-optical                  
              information will be used to define and quantify linkages between               
              ozone-dependent oscillations in UV to PAR ratios and                           
              phytoplankton productivity.  Special emphasis will be place on                 
              defining biological restraints imposed by enhanced UVB and                     
              altered UVB:UVA:PAR ratios on the balance of UVB photodamage to                
              photorepair, photoprotective and photosynthetic mechanisms                     
              operating in the Southern Ocean.  The overall aim is to test the               
              hypothesis that phytoplankton in Antarctic waters are adversely                
              influenced by ozone depletion.
