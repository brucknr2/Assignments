Abstract    :
              This research involves the investigation of amorphous                          
              hydrogenated silicon-carbon alloys by a combination of junction                
              capacitance techniques.  The intention is to study the detailed                
              energy map of amorphous hydrogenated silicon-carbon films deep                 
              defect density-of-states (DOS) over a significant portion of the               
              mobility gap.  Photocapacitance spectrocopy will provide an                    
              accurate energy map of deep defects to a depth of 1.1 eV below                 
              the mobility edge.  A series of high quality samples will be                   
              prepared by Shing of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory employing a                 
              Glasstech PECVD system.  The research will involve undergraduates              
              in every aspect of the proposed study.  Initial measurements will              
              involve capacitance-temperature measurements.  This work will aid              
              in the development of optoelectronic devices such as photovoltaic              
              cells.
