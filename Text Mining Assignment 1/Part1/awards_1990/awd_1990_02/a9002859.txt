Abstract    :
                   Recent studies on the origin and development of continental               
              rifts have clearly been hampered by our lack of knowledge on the               
              deep structure of the East African Rift.  This classic rift is                 
              the standard by which all others are measured.  This grant is one              
              of six collaborative grants which support U.S. participation in                
              an international effort to conduct a cooperative study of the                  
              Kenyan, Federal Republic of Germany and the European Economic                  
              Community, with additional participation by France, Holland,                   
              Spain and Ireland, as well as Kenya.  This award provides travel,              
              per diem and miscellaneous expenses support for personnel from                 
              the U. S. Geological Survey which has a major role.  A                         
              preliminary experiment was completed in 1985.  The results of                  
              this experiment suggest that the deep structure of the Kenya                   
              Rift is different than anticipated and that the major phase of                 
              the project is both scientifically valid and logistically                      
              feasible.  The major seismic experiment is aimed at determining                
              lithospheric structure in the rift and in adjacent areas.                      
              Structure of the sub-Moho lithosphere along the rift, detailed                 
              structure in the axial area of the rift, and the transition zones              
              between the rift and adjacent areas are the prime areas of                     
              emphasis.
