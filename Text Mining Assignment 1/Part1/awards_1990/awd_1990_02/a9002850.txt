Abstract    :
              This work addresses wave propagation in extended, inhomogeneous,               
              multidimensional environments capable of channeling energy over                
              many wavelengths.  Sound propagation in the ocean and                          
              electromagnetic guided-wave propagation are two examples.  The                 
              objective of this research is to further develop and apply                     
              "microscopic" phase space (pseudo-differential and generalized                 
              Fourier integral operator) methods and global path integral                    
              constructions to derive new multidimensional algorithms for                    
              forward acoustic propagation and generalized acoustic tomography               
              at the level of the n-dimensional scalar Helmholtz equation.
