Abstract    :
                   The recoil-corrected continuum shell model will be used to                
              calculate (k+,k-) cross sections for the production of doubly                  
              strange hypernuclei, and nucleon knock out reactions induced by                
              electrons and pions.  Calculations for eta-photoproduction on                  
              nuclei will be carried out.
