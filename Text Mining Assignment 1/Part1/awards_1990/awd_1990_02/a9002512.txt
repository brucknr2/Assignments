Abstract    :
                   Edgar H. Brown will extend real and rational homotopy theory              
              and apply it to classifying spaces coming from Lie algebras and                
              foliations.                                                                    
                   Jerome Levine will study problems in link concordance,                    
              algebraic closure of groups and proposed new link invariants.                  
                   Kiyoshi Igusa plans to continue his investigation into the                
              relationship between algebraic K-theory and smooth manifolds.  He              
              also intends to apply algebraic K-theory and cyclic homology to                
              the representation theory of finite dimensional algebras.                      
                   Daniel Ruberman will continue his work on gauge theory and                
              geometric invariants of 3-manifolds.  Applications in knot                     
              theory, and the study of surfaces in 4-manifolds will be pursued.
