Abstract    :
              Dr. Reeve has recently gained access, through a NATO sponsored                 
              collaboration with Professor K. O. Stetter in Germany, to an                   
              archaebacterium that is hyperthermophilic (grows only within the               
              temperature range of 90 to 115 degrees Centigrade).  These                     
              bacteria grow at the highest temperatures known for a living                   
              organism, and it is impossible to carry out genetic approaches to              
              understanding how the bacterium can grow at these temperatures                 
              using current genetic techniques.  Genes from the                              
              hyperthermophile AV19 will be cloned into Escherichia coli, where              
              it may be possible to determine their function and DNA sequences.              
              If preliminary experiments are successful under this Small Grant               
              for Exploratory Research they will open up a major field of study              
              that would be more appropriate for a larger award.
