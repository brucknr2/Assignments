Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will continue his work within                  
              the general area of exchangeability.  His general interest                     
              ranges over all aspects of the theory, from the basic                          
              foundations and representation theorems, via specific properties               
              of exchangeable processes, to a variety of applications and                    
              extension to other areas of probability theory.  The present                   
              proposal is focused on some specific problems involving                        
              multivariate representation theorems and their relation to                     
              multiple stochastic integration, the notion of spreadability or                
              subsequence invariance, the representation of stable stochastic                
              integrals and properties of exchangeable interval partitions,                  
              their local time random measures and Palm distributions.
