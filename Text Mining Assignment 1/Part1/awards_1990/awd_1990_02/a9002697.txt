Abstract    :
              A combined numerical modeling and laboratory study will be                     
              conducted to simulate flow in ice covered rivers and channels.                 
              Velocity distributions, shear stresses, and macro turbulence                   
              features will be explored for flow under an ice cover and over                 
              an alluvial sediment bed and the dunes which are generated on                  
              such a bed.  The computations will use a model which has                       
              recently been utilized in a study of turbulence over a wavy                    
              surface.  The laboratory experiment will use an existing                       
              sediment flume with simulated ice.                                             
                                                                                             
              Improve accuracy in the prediction of flow rates, free surface                 
              height, and sediment transport under freezing conditions will                  
              have an important impact on environmental and structural                       
              issues related to the hydraulics of ice covered waters.
