Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This dissertation research project in ecological anthropology                  
              will support a Spanish speaking cultural anthropologist for                    
              extended research on the knowledge about and use of Sabal palm                 
              trees in the Maya area of Yucatan, Mexico.  These palms have been              
              used domestically for at least 1000 years.  Using archival,                    
              ecological, and ethnographic methods the investigator will                     
              analyze the systematic knowledge and current practices of the                  
              people using palm trees, and compare that to practices of                      
              previous populations.  The study will compare information from                 
              three communities.                                                             
                                                                                             
              The study will provide empirical evidence of interest to all                   
              research fields dealing with human-nature interactions.  It will               
              contribute to the growing body of knowledge of tropical forest                 
              environments, and could potentially be useful to development                   
              planners of settlements in similar environments.
