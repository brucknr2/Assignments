Abstract    :
                   This grant provides partial support for the collaboration of              
              Prof. Sally F. Hicks, University of Dallas, Prof. Jeffrey R.                   
              Vanhoy, U. S. Naval Academy, and the University of Kentucky to                 
              study the collectively excited structure of 140Ce.  Inelastic                  
              neutron scattering will be used to bombard isotopically enriched               
              Ce targets for this work.  The quadrupole and octopole                         
              excitations can be understood from measurements of elastic and                 
              inelastic differential neutron cross sections.  Additionally, the              
              states of 127Xe will be studied by means of the 127I(p,n)                      
              reaction because of the importance of 127Xe as a neutrino                      
              detector.  Completion of some work involving a systematic study                
              of nuclei in the Pb region is also planned as part of this grant.
