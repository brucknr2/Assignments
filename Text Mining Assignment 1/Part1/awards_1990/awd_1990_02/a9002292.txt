Abstract    :
              The reseach concerns the computational complexity of feasible                  
              computations.  The objectives of this project are twofold:  to                 
              establish a firm complexity theoretic underpinning for public-key              
              cryptography; to reveal the rich structure that individual complexity          
              classes, such as NP, appear to have, and to increase understanding of          
              the structural relations between low-level complexity classes.  One            
              emphasis will be to continue research in structural complexity theory          
              that lays a foundation for cryptography.  The approach is to base the          
              investigation of existence of cryptographic assumptions (or                    
              primitives) directly on structural properties of complexity classes,           
              rather than on presumed intractability of individual concrete                  
              problems.
