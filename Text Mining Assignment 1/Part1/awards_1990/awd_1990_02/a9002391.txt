Abstract    :
              The destructive power of tornadoes is well known, but the exact                
              dynamical processes that cause the formation and maintenance of                
              tornadoes is not yet completely understood.                                    
                                                                                             
              The Principal Investigator will use a numerical model to study the             
              dynamics of the air flow in and around a tornado vortex with a                 
              concentration on the region that would be below cloud base in an               
              actual thunderstorm.  The Principal Investigator will utilize, for the         
              first time in a study of this type, advanced numerical techniques that         
              allow the model to adjust its resolution as the model runs.  This              
              provides fine resolution only in the areas where it is most needed.            
              Additionally, most previous studies of vortices, whether laboratory,           
              numerical or theoretical, have assumed symmetry of the environmental           
              flow.  The Principal Investigator will be able to relax this                   
              assumption which will provide the ability to study these vortices              
              under a variety of environmental conditions.
