Abstract    :
                   This research is concerned with the algebraic K-groups of                 
              infinite fields. The principal investigator is studying aspects                
              of the geometric significance of some filtration quotients of                  
              these K-groups. These quotients bring together various fields                  
              of mathematical research including the homology of the general                 
              linear group, the higher Chow groups of Bloch and certain                      
              scissors congruence groups of polytopes.                                       
                   Algebraic geometry is the study of the geometric objects                  
              arising from the sets of zeros of systems of polynomial                        
              equations. This is one of the oldest and currently one of the                  
              most active branches of mathematics. There are widespread                      
              applications of algebraic geometry in mathematics, physics and                 
              computer science.
