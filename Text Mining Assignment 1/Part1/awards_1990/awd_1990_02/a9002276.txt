Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              An important factor in estimating a tsunami                                    
              hazard from a particular source is knowledge                                   
              of what previous tsunamis from that general                                    
              region have done.  The record of these                                         
              effects is far from complete for the U.S.                                      
              West Coast.  Given a return rate of 100 to                                     
              200 years for many great Pacific earthquakes,                                  
              and the changes in the population density,                                     
              coastal development, and coastal area usage                                    
              since the 19th Century, the hazard from a                                      
              repeat of these events is significantly                                        
              increased.  Of the 13 tsunamis with                                            
              amplitudes of 1 meter or more which occurred                                   
              on the West Coast, only the latest two, 1960                                   
              and 1964, caused damage of more than a few                                     
              thousand dollars.  These waves would not have                                  
              been particularly noteworthy had they                                          
              occurred in the 19th Century or early 20th                                     
              Century; reports of their effects would be                                     
              limited to local sources.  Conversely,                                         
              tsunamis which did occur in the 18th Century                                   
              without causing significant damage could be                                    
              destructive if they are repeated in the                                        
              future.  Automatic recording tide gages were                                   
              installed at San Diego and San Francisco,                                      
              California, and Astoria, Oregon in 1854, the                                   
              earliest operated in the Pacific.  The                                         
              publication of newspapers on the West Coast                                    
              began at a somewhat earlier date.  Using                                       
              contemporary records, extant tide gage                                         
              records, and a tide prediction computer                                        
              program, this project will improve the                                         
              quality of the historical record by adding                                     
              new descriptive and quantitative data,                                         
              correcting errors in existing knowledge, and                                   
              reducing the uncertainty of the source and                                     
              effects of reports of early tsunamis.                                          
              Analyses of the resulting improved data base                                   
              will show the unique features of the hazard.                                   
              This information is essential to the design                                    
              of effective tsunami warning systems and                                       
              other counter measures.
