Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Three investigators will study problems interrelating the                 
              geometry and topology of finite dimensional manifolds with                     
              analytic, algebraic, and geometric properties of various function              
              spaces that arise in the study of ordinary and partial                         
              differential equations on these manifolds.  One investigator will              
              study symmetry groups of a variational problem and the geometry                
              of their associated sections and slices.  The second will                      
              investigate the Grassmannian structures of the solution to                     
              integrable systems and the related Painleve analysis of these                  
              structures.  And the third will analyze the relationship between               
              the Laurent solutions to integrable systems and the geometry of                
              their invariant tori.                                                          
                   These three investigators will extend theories involving the              
              geometry and algebra of certain integrable systems.  One example               
              of such systems are Hamiltonian differential equations which                   
              model the physical behavior of moving objects.  These incorporate              
              conservation of energy and momentum in an elegant manner.                      
              Solutions to these systems tend to circulate and don't                         
              have many of the properties of systems which incorporate                       
              friction.
