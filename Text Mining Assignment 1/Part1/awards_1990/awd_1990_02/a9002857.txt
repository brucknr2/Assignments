Abstract    :
              The goal is to examine dynamics and phase transitions for                      
              adsorbates at high densities and low temperatures, and under                   
              restricted dimensionality, using pulsed NMR as a probe.  The                   
              proposed research includes:  studies of structure, motions,                    
              conversion and phase-transitions in solid H2, HD and D2 at high                
              densities; high-pressure studies of Kr and Xe; very detailed                   
              studies of adsorbed films of H2, HD, D2, Kr and Xe on MgO and BN               
              substrates and in porous media; measurements on the relaxation of              
              dilute light impurities and on the structural transitions they                 
              may induce.
