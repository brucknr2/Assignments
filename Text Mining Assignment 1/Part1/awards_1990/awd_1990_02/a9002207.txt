Abstract    :
              Description:  This project supports travel of Indian scientists                
              to attend the Fifteenth International Symposium on Effects of                  
              Radiation on Materials.  The symposium is held every two years                 
              and is sponsored by the American Society for Testing and                       
              Materials (ASTM), Committee E10 on Nuclear Technology and                      
              Applications.  It addresses fundamental and technological                      
              aspects of radiation damage.  It is followed by a series of                    
              subcommittee meetings with full international representation to                
              develop consensus standards for materials to be used in nuclear                
              power generation.  Participation by Indian scientists is                       
              expected to lead to increased collaboration with U.S.                          
              scientists.  The Indian scientists are expected to visit various               
              U.S. national laboratories and universities as part of their                   
              trip.  Proceedings are to be published in hardbound books and                  
              are subject to rigorous scientific peer review.                                
                                                                                             
              Scope:  Indian scientists' participation is likely to benefit                  
              the working of the symposium.  They will be selected based on                  
              the quality and relevance of their independently submitted                     
              abstracts, and to ensure broad participation of the Indian                     
              nuclear materials community.  The selection will be made by the                
              P.I. and by the symposium Vice Chairman, with help from Dr.                    
              Kanwar Krishan of the Indira Gandhi Center for Atomic Research                 
              in Kalpakkam, Tamilnadu, India, who is a member of the Program                 
              Committee.
