Abstract    :
              This is an award to support for Phase II of a project                          
              initiated under NSF Grant No. 88-60957 under conditions                        
              outlined in the Program Solicitation for Small Business                        
              Innovation Research, NSF 88-8.  The work under Phase I                         
              resulted in demonstration of the feasibility of using                          
              electrochemically generated superoxide for rapid and                           
              complete degradation of chlorinated organic pollutants of                      
              water using specially designed electrodes that allowed for                     
              the efficient dechlorination of the pollutant substrates.                      
              In Phase II, the investigators plan a systematic                               
              examination of the reaction products and their rate of                         
              formation and destruction  as the basis for determining                        
              the efficiency of the process and its economic                                 
              feasibility.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              The contamination of ground and surface waters by organic                      
              compounds that are the target of this research is a matter                     
              of great National concern.  It is imperative that                              
              technologies be developed that are more efficiently                            
              responsive to removal of organic pollutants from water and                     
              wastewater.  Results of this project are expected to be                        
              useful in this respect.
