Abstract    :
                   This research will use quantitative methods to discriminate               
              tectonic from eustatic components of sea level change during                   
              deposition of Pennsylvanian cyclothems of North America and                    
              Northwest Europe.  Techniques to be used include (1) quantitative              
              tectonic subsidence analysis, back-stripped with corrections for               
              compaction, sediment load, paleodepth and sea level change, (2)                
              calculation of tectonic plate stress and its effect on sea level               
              change, and (3) determination of the present-day elevation of                  
              Pennsylvanian shoreline sediments so as to identify Pennsylvanian              
              paleo-sealevel on a stable reference datum.  New criteria of the               
              preserved position of sea level (so-called "sea level markers")                
              in coastal sedimentary rocks are available now to constrain the                
              range of such determinations.  Paleodepths can be identified from              
              this datum by measuring the decompacted thickness of vertical                  
              sequences of shoreline facies.  The decompacted thickness of                   
              barrier island and tidal flat vertical sequences provides a                    
              numerical estimate of the magnitude of eustatic change in sea                  
              level, and will be used to make the eustatic sea level correction              
              for tecotnic subsidence analysis.  Expected results include                    
              determining the exact present-day elevation of Pennsylvanian sea               
              level, and the numerical magnitude of both eustatic and tectonic               
              components of Pennsylvanian sea level change.  The approach to be              
              tested herein can then be used to make similar determinations of               
              eustatic and tectonic controls on sea level in sedimentary rocks               
              representing other periods of earth history.
