Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This MRG provides a three-year integrated program devoted to a                 
              micro-mechanics approach to the design and processing of                       
              composites with optimal failure resistance in technical                        
              applications.  The research will focus on metal-matrix and                     
              ceramic-matrix composites.  Intermetallics will also be included               
              because of their potential for providing both toughness and                    
              strength at high temperatures.  The participants will develop a                
              quantitative understanding of the mechanics of failure                         
              (i) through determination of the microstructure of the materials,              
              (ii) by development of constitutive models for the components and              
              their interfaces, (iii) by numerical simulation of the fracture                
              process, and (iv) by integration of simulated responses to                     
              experimental measurements of materials properties.  The research               
              will be carried out by faculty, post-doctoral associates,                      
              graduate students and undergraduate students.
