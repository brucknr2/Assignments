Abstract    :
                   The object of this project is to analyze the dynamics and                 
              control of a number of mathematical systems of practical                       
              interest.  In the first place the dynamics and control of                      
              rotating systems will be studied using recently developed Energy-              
              Momentum methods.  A new approach to stabilizing unstable control              
              systems by the Energy-Casimir method will be considered.  Finite               
              dimensional reductions and transit from stability to unstability               
              will be studied.  Finally, the principal investigator will try to              
              extend his recent work on Toda lattice to further understanding                
              of certain gradient and Hamiltonian systems.
