Abstract    :
                   This award will provide funds to partially support a grant                
              from the University of South Carolina to do research on heavy,                 
              weakly interacting massive particles (WIMP's) that might                       
              constitute the missing mass in the halo of our galaxy.  For                    
              this, they will employ cryogenic detectors that respond to the                 
              increase in temperature caused by the energy deposition from                   
              nuclear recoil induced by collisions with the heavy particles.                 
              The first phase of the research will be the construction of an                 
              ultralow radioactive background liquid helium-4 cryostat and                   
              the development of a superconducting granular detector.  The                   
              detector will consist of large arrays of superconducting                       
              sensors sensitive to the weakly interacting particles.  These                  
              developments will provide the feasibility study of a new                       
              generation of detection techniques for weakly interacting                      
              particles in general, e.g. solar neutrinos.  This project will                 
              be a collaborative effort between the University of South                      
              Carolina, the University of Maryland, the University of British                
              Columbia and Applied Research Corporation.
