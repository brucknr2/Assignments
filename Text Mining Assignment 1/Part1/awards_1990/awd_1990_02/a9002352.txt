Abstract    :
              Research in three broad areas of computational geometry will be                
              conducted.  These areas cover the spectrum from practical                      
              considerations which arise when implementing and debugging geometric           
              algorithms to theoretical questions arising in algorithm design and            
              lower bound proofs.  They include design and analysis of algorithms,           
              concentrating mostly on problems involving nonlinear surfaces in               
              dimensions higher than two, in particular, hidden surface removal,             
              triangulations of real-algebraic varieties, and multidimensional               
              searching, building an environment for implementing geometric                  
              algorithms and tools which can ultimately be used by researchers to            
              produce and share geometric software, and design of robust geometric           
              algorithms which entails tackling problems arising from finite                 
              precision arithmetic as well as the degeneracy of common real world            
              geometric data.
