Abstract    :
              Dr. Margaret M. Bruehl has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research                
              Fellowship In Chemistry. Dr. Bruehl's doctoral degree was from                 
              Northwestern University under the supervision of Professor                     
              George Schatz.  Dr.Bruehl intends to continue research at the                  
              University of Colorado under the sponsorship of Professor James                
              T. Hynes.  Dr. Bruehl's area of postdoctoral training and                      
              research will be theoretical chemical dynamics with emphasis on                
              simulation, and interpretation of results in terms of analytic                 
              and approximation theories.  Complex systems in the condensed                  
              phase will be considered, specifically proton and hydride                      
              transfer reactions in solution and in model enzymes.                           
                                                                                             
              The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as                 
              an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the                   
              knowledge and experience of new Ph.D's and attract them into                   
              meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and                       
              teaching.
