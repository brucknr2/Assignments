Abstract    :
                   Solovay plans to investigate various questions in                         
              mathematical logic, including questions concerning models of                   
              inductive inference, exotic Boolean algebras, and the                          
              consistency of Quine's system of set-theory, "New Foundations."                
              In addition, work is planned on the following topics:                          
              reconstructing Godel's proof of the independence of the axiom of               
              choice; cutting down his backlog of unpublished papers; learning               
              more about neural nets and neurobiology; and learning more about               
              random graphs with hopes that it has applications to complexity                
              theory.
