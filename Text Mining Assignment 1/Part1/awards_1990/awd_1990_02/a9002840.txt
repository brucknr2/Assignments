Abstract    :
              This Science in Developing Countries award will support a                      
              regional workshop in mathematics organized by Professor                        
              Joseph Kohn of Princeton University and mathematicians from                    
              the Centro de Matematica, Universidad Central del Ecuador                      
              under the direction of Professor Ronaldo Saenz Andrade.  The                   
              workshop will involve up to five representatives from the                      
              different Bolivarian countries (Panama, Venezuela, Colombia,                   
              Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia) plus Chile, with an emphasis on                    
              the selection of young and active mathematicians interested                    
              in increasing communication with the international mathematical                
              community.  In addition, there will be participation of a                      
              number of outstanding European mathematicians who will be                      
              supported by their own countries.                                              
                                                                                             
              The workshop will include the following activities:  lectures,                 
              round table discussions, and a mini-course with ample                          
              opportunities for informal discussions.  The teaching of                       
              mathematics and the promotion of research activities will be                   
              emphasized, taking into account the experiences of the                         
              attendees.  The participation of a distinguished group of                      
              U.S. mathematicians, who are knowledgeable about the problems                  
              of doing research and teaching in Latin America, is likely to                  
              lead to improved communication and increased mathematical                      
              activity in the region.
