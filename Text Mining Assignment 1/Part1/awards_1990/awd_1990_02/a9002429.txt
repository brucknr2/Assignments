Abstract    :
                   This research will lie in the area of mathematical                        
              statistics and will concern bootstrap methodology.  The bootstrap              
              methodology was introduced by Efron in 1979 and is being                       
              increasingly used in statistical inference in a wide variety of                
              situations.  The method is simple, generally applicable both in                
              parametric and nonparametric problems, and has great potential to              
              be an important tool in extracting information from data.  This                
              research is aimed at examining the existing techniques and                     
              working out modified or alternative techniques which lead to                   
              more efficient results.                                                        
                   The bootstrap method is highly computational and this grant               
              supports computer equipment to continue work in this area of                   
              statistics.  In addition to this equipment support, the principal              
              investigator is supported by the Army Research Office and the Air              
              Force Office of Scientific Research.
