Abstract    :
              Transoceanic undersea telecommunications cables are becoming                   
              available for re-use by the scientific community.  These                       
              cables cross vast regions of the floors of the Atlantic and                    
              Pacific oceans.  They traverse nearly every type of                            
              geomorphic province, including deep ocean basins, ridge                        
              systems, oceanic trenches and continental margins; and they                    
              underlie most features of ocean dynamics including western                     
              and eastern boundary currents, central gyres and areas of                      
              fronts and eddies.                                                             
                                                                                             
              The workshop will 1) assess scientific needs, opportunities                    
              and interest for re-use of cables soon to be abandoned by                      
              international telephone companies, 2) develop initial                          
              technical models for adding scientific instrumentation, 3)                     
              examine ways to manage facilities, experiments and data, and                   
              4) determine cost estimates for scientific use of these                        
              systems.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              The workshop is being held in January 1990 on Oahu in Hawaii                   
              where primary shore-based cable facilities for the Pacific                     
              are located.  The University of Hawaii will provide local                      
              support.  A seven member science steering committee will                       
              ensure balanced representation of the approximately 30                         
                                                                                             
              participants anticipated.  They will also prepare and publish                  
                                                                                             
              a full report of the workshop, with conclusions, working                       
                                                                                             
              papers and recommendations for science planning included, by
