Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research on multivariable hyper-                  
              geometric series of Professor Robert Gustafson of Texas A & M                  
              University. Dr. Gustafson has proposed to develop the theory of                
              hypergeometric series that are very well poised on semisimple Lie              
              algebras, as well as the corresponding theory of beta and Mellin-              
              Barnes integrals on compact Lie groups and the associated Lie                  
              algebras. In addition, he plans to relate this theory to the                   
              families of orthogonal polynomials associated to root systems,                 
              recently defined by Macdonald.                                                 
                   This research falls in the broad category of combinatorics,               
              which is one of the most active fields in today's mathematics.                 
              Fundamentally, combinatorics represents a systematization of the               
              very first of all mathematical activities, counting. In its                    
              modern development, however, combinatorics has gone beyond just                
              counting to make use of a wide variety of advanced mathematical                
              techniques, and although its roots go back several centuries, the              
              field has had an explosive development in the past few decades                 
              because of its importance in communications and information                    
              technology.
