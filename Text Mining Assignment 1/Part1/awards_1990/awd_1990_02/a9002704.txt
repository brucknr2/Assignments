Abstract    :
                This grant will fund urgently needed support through the SGER                
              program to cover the critical costs for field measurements of                  
              the large (Ms=7.1) Santa Cruz Mountains earthquake, for data                   
              reduction, data analysis and for rapid distribution of this                    
              information to the scientific community.  Prior to the main shock              
              on October 17, 1989, the principal investigator, on the basis of               
              two large foreshocks, installed four digital strong ground motion              
              recorders in the area of main shock which recorded invaluable                  
              strong motion data.  This grant will support that work and enable              
              follow-on analysis of the aftershock series.  This work has                    
              direct application to the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction                 
              Program.
