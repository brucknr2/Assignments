Abstract    :
                   How the monsoon system in tropical Africa has reacted to                  
              changes in climate boundary conditions can be answered by                      
              reconstructing its history on 106-year time scales.  But the                   
              logistics of study in this region are difficult: any concerted                 
              research strategy must involve international cooperation.  This                
              proposal requests support to organize and conduct a workshop with              
              the following goals: 1) to evaluate the relationship between                   
              sediment characteristics and climate in East African rift lakes;               
              2) to develop a strategy for recovering long sediment records in               
              the rift lakes; and 3) to use them to reconstruct the 5 to 10                  
              million year record of climate in tropical Africa.  The PIs                    
              envision a decade-long research program that will involve US and               
              international participants.  The PIs will use the support from                 
              this grant to develop such a research strategy.  This research                 
              is important because east Africa boasts a large portion of the                 
              world's population, dependent on an agrarian economy, so changes               
              in the monsoon affect the lives of many people.
