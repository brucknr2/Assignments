Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will study several problems in                 
              optimal deterministic or stochastic control and probability,                   
              using the theory of nonlinear partial differential equations.                  
              The project consists of three parts.  The optimal control of a                 
              singularly controlled Brownian motion will be studied using the                
              results for free boundary problems.  This approach has yielded                 
              regularity results when the dimension is equal to two and it is                
              the first multi-dimensional result which yields the construction               
              of the optimal process.  It now appears that it can be                         
              generalized to higher dimensions.  The second part of this                     
              project is devoted to the perturbation theory of infinite                      
              dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi equations.  As a case study, the                   
              principal investigator will study an asymptotic problem related                
              to simple exclusion processes.  Finally, an application of the                 
              finite dimensional perturbation theory to a problem of production              
              planning is described.  The model to be studied has failure-prone              
              machines, and the goal is to construct approximate optimal                     
              policies by exploiting the hierarchical structure of the model.
