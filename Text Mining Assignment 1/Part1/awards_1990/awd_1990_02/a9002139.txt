Abstract    :
              Kump proposes: 1) to test a new approach (neutron activation)                  
              for distinguishing among the many stable isotopes of iron, and,                
              2) to find out whether enough fractionation occurs in nature to                
              permit the use of iron isotopes to characterize the history of                 
              natural systems.  The wide range of isotopic masses for iron (54               
              to 58), together with its involvement in microbially-mediated                  
              reactions, other redox reactions, diffusion, transport and                     
              precipitation, strongly suggest that isotopic effects are likely,              
              and that their interpretation will lead to a better understanding              
              of natural processes that are important both in research and in                
              environmental assessment.
