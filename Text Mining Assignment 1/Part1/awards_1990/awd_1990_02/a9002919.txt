Abstract    :
                   The three principal investigators propose to conduct                      
              research into the mathematical theory of control, stabilization,               
              and optimization of infinite dimensional systems - in particular,              
              distributed parameter systems governed by partial differential                 
              equations (PDE) and hereditary systems governed by differential-               
              delay (DDE) or more general functional -differential equations                 
              (FDE).  These investigations will concentrate on the problems of               
              Hybrid Control Systems in which an infinite dimensional system is              
              linked or coupled to a simpler system, usually a finite                        
              dimensional process controlled through ordinary differential                   
              equations (ODE).                                                               
                   These mathematical questions are motivated by a multitude                 
              of control-theoretic problems of importance in current advanced                
              engineering projects (aerospace guidance, space platform and                   
              space station control and stabilization), as well as in                        
              industrial engineering projects (tape processing).                             
                   In this sense the investigators recognize the two-way                     
              interaction between classical mathematical analysis, and physical              
              and engineering sciences; but this research project will                       
              concentrate on the mathematical side, although the research will               
              necessarily be motivated by the areas of applications.
