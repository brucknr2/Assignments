Abstract    :
              This award will provide supplemental support to enable Dr.                     
              Thomasson of West Virginia University to carry out a long-term                 
              research stay to collaborate with Dr. Hirokazu Kato of the                     
              Geological Survey of Japan in Tsukuba, Japan.  They will investigate           
              the Itoigawa-Shizuoka tectonic line, a major discontinuity in the              
              tectonic framework of Japan.                                                   
                                                                                             
              There are many similarities in the geology of the Itoigawa-                    
              Shizuoka region of Japan and the Appalachian mountain region of                
              the U.S.  Dr. Kato's group has detailed data on the deeper crustal             
              and near-surface structural characteristics of the Itoigawa-                   
              Shizouka tectonic line and surrounding areas.  Dr. Wilson will                 
              investigate whether the geophysical nature of the deep crustal                 
              features present in the central Appalachians are comparable to the             
              modern-day analogue in Japan.
