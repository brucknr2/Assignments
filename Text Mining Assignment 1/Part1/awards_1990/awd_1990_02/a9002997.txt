Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will continue to develop the                   
              theory of stochastic partial differential equations (SPDE's).                  
              Random fields governed by SPDE's have been used intensively in                 
              physics, biology, chemistry, and electrical engineering as models              
              for various random phenomena.  Substantial progress in this                    
              field has been made in the last decade, but still the theory is                
              in its infancy.  The investigator plans to continue his research               
              in several related areas of linear and non-linear SPDE's.
