Abstract    :
              Graph traversal is a fundamental computational problem, not only               
              because it is the natural abstraction of many search problems, but             
              also because its complexity is at the root of important relationships          
              among deterministic, nondeterministic, and probabilistic computations.         
              Significant progress has been made during the last two years toward            
              understanding the complexity of graph traversal.  Viewing the problem          
              in its natural structured setting was crucial to most or all of these          
              advances.  This project is following a number of approaches to                 
              investigate the time and space complexity of graph traversal in                
              structured settings.  The goal is to obtain stronger results in the            
              previously studied structured settings, and novel results in                   
              substantially richer structured settings.                                      
                                                                                             
              Similarly, structured views of important algebraic problems such as            
              matrix multiplication have been instrumental in advances toward                
              understanding those problems.  The project is also investigating the           
              communication and space complexity of these problems, motivated by the         
              importance of communication in parallel and distributed computation.
