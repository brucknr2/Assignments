Abstract    :
              Funds will be provided to enable qualified U.S. scientists to                  
              attend the 20th International Conference on the Physics of                     
              Semiconductors, to be held in Thessaloniki, Greece, August 6-10,               
              1990.  A selection committee chaired by S. Pantelides will decide              
              on disposition of the funds.  This will be done on the basis of                
              the merit, as evidenced in requests submitted in writing to the                
              committee.  The awards will be given predominantly to scientists               
              in the early stages of their careers.
