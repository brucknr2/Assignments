Abstract    :
              A group of investigators with related interest in the synthesis,               
              immunogenicity and conformation of middle-sized peptide fragments              
              and small proteins propose to install a circular dichroism                     
              spectrometer (dichrograph) with controlling computer.  No                      
              instrument for measuring circular dichroism spectra is currently               
              available in the Wistar Institute or at the University of                      
              Pennsylvania.  The dichrograph will permit a quick spectroscopic               
              characterization of a large number of peptides synthesized for                 
              immunological studies, and as models for protein folding                       
              intermediates.  It will provide information on the secondary                   
              structure and conformational flexibility in solution of the                    
              synthetic fragments.  The instrument will make it possible to study            
              the correlation conformational changes of immunogenic peptides as              
              well as conformational changes due to post-translational                       
              modifications (e.g., glycosylation and phosphorylation).  Other                
              applications include measurement of protein denaturation curves in             
              order to determine the effect of mutation on protein stability,                
              and conformational studies on peptide models of protein folding                
              intermediates in cytochrome C and ubiquitin.
