Abstract    :
                   The CEDAR ( Coupling, Energetics and Dynamics of Atmospheric              
              Regions) program is very much concerned with multi-station                     
              campaigns for acquisition of data on the polar region atmosphere.              
              The topic of this program involves the operation of an optical                 
              observatory at Thule, Greenland.  The observations made with high              
              sensitivity electronic imaging systems, Fabry-Perot                            
              interferometers and spectrometers will be used to study the                    
              optical emissions from the airglow and the aurora as applied to                
              the understanding of plasma convection across the polar cap and                
              the motion of the thermospheric neutral atmosphere.
