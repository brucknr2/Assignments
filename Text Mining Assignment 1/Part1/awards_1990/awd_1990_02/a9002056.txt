Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research in algebraic geometry and                
              combinatorics of Professor Bernd Sturmfels of Cornell University.              
              Dr. Sturmfels has proposed to make use of the combinatorial structure          
              of convex polytopes to attack problems in constructive algebra                 
              and algebraic geometry. His research on combinatorial structures               
              arising in geometry will include a study of higher-order matroids              
              associated with graded ideals and how they relate to the state                 
              polytopes of these ideals.                                                     
                   This research falls in the broad category of combinatorics,               
              which is one of the most active fields in today's mathematics.                 
              Fundamentally, combinatorics represents a systematization of the               
              very first of all mathematical activities, counting. In its                    
              modern development, however, combinatorics has gone beyond just                
              counting to make use of a wide variety of advanced mathematical                
              techniques, and although its roots go back several centuries, the              
              field has had an explosive development in the past few decades                 
              because of its importance in communications and information                    
              technology.
