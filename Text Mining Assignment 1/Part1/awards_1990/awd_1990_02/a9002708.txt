Abstract    :
                   This proposal is to collect tracer and hydrographic data in               
              connection with the deployment and recovery of a suite of current              
              meter moorings in the Pacific Ocean near New Zealand.  The                     
              purpose is to measure the influx of deep waters into the Pacific               
              Basin.  Deep water flow in this region has never been measured,                
              although it is responsible for the principal water masses in the               
              Pacific.  The work is coordinated with proposals by Nowlin                     
              (8917338) and Pillsbury (9002709) and the New Zealand                          
              Oceanographic Institution.   It is a component of the World Ocean              
              Circulation Experiment (WOCE).
