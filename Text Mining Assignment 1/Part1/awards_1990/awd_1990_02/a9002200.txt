Abstract    :
              Dr. Gregory C. Fu has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research                     
              Fellowship in Chemistry.  Dr. Fu's doctoral degree was from                    
              Harvard University under the supervision of Professor David                    
              Evans.  Dr. Fu intends to continue his research at the                         
              California Institute of Technology under the sponsorship of                    
              Professor Robert Grubbs.  Dr. Fu's area of postdoctoral                        
              training and research will be the study of organometallic                      
              reaction mechanisms and the design of stereoselective                          
              metal-catalyzed organic reactions.  Specifically, he will                      
              investigate the mechanism of the ruthenium(II)-catalyzed                       
              ring-opening metathesis reaction.                                              
                                                                                             
              The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as                 
              an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the                   
              knowledge and experience of new Ph.Ds and attract them into                    
              meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and                       
              teaching.
