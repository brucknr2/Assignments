Abstract    :
                   When the database grows larger and larger, the user no                    
              longer knows what is in the database. Nor does the user know                   
              clearly what should be retrieved.  How to get at the data becomes              
              a central problem for very large databases.  This research                     
              addresses this problem through data visualization and visual                   
              reasoning.  The main idea is to transform the data objects and                 
              present sample data in a visual space.  The user can then                      
              incrementally formulate the information retrieval request in the               
              visual space.  By combining data visualization, visual query,                  
              visual examples, and visual cues, this research will yield better              
              ways of formulating and modifying users' queries. A prototype                  
              system has been developed to serve as an experimental testbed.                 
              This research will develop a framework for testing new                         
              methodologies for visual reasoning as applied to information                   
              retrieval in very large databases.  It will also lead to more                  
              powerful iconic user interfaces, and combine previous research                 
              results in spatial reasoning, example-based programming, and                   
              approximate retrieval from databases.
