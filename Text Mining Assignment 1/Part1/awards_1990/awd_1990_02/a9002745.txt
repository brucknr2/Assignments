Abstract    :
                   In this proposal the principal investigator plans to                      
              continue his studies of the formation and propagation of shock                 
              waves in stiff polymeric materials and to develop a mathematical               
              theory of finite deformations of membranes.  The latter theory is              
              useful in providing better estimates of the errors incurred when               
              employing stress analysis to wrinkled membranes.  The principal                
              investigator will also study the mathematical properties of                    
              certain idealized materials that have applications to the                      
              twinning of crystals and the behavior of shape-memory alloys.                  
                   Materials scientists very often study the properties of                   
              materials by testing their responses to applied stresses; one                  
              could call this the experimental approach.  Mathematicians                     
              interested in the behavior of materials usually take a different               
              approach which involves the theoretical analysis of mathematical               
              models of materials.  In this proposal the principal investigator              
              will use advanced mathematics to try to understand twinning in                 
              crystals, necking in polymers and the behavior of shape-memory                 
              alloys.
