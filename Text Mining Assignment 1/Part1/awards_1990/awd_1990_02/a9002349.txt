Abstract    :
                   Reaction diffusion equations may give rise to a variety                   
              of pattern like solutions.  These include traveling wave                       
              solutions, stable steady solutions, cellular patterns,                         
              oscillatory solutions, and even solutions which behave in a                    
              chaotic manner.  All of the systems which the principle                        
              investigator will consider arise as a mathematical model of a                  
              biological or chemical system.  This project will consider                     
              models for combusion, chemical reactions on catalytic surfaces,                
              phase transitions, and bursting in excitable membranes.  The                   
              primary goals of this research project are to investigate through              
              which mathematical mechanisms these patterns may arise, analyse                
              the stability properties of each pattern, and understand what                  
              physical significance each pattern has for the underlying                      
              physical problem.                                                              
                   The problems to be addressed in this project raise a number               
              of fundamental mathematical issues.  Of particular interest are                
              patterns arising in more than one space dimension.  Much of the                
              analysis will be concerned with how higher dimensional patterns                
              bifurcate from basically one dimensional objects such as planar                
              wave solutions and radially symmetric solutions.  Simple                       
              examples demonstrate that the structure of the bifurcating                     
              patterns may be incredibly complex.
