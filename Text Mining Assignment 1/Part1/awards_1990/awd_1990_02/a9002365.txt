Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The goal of this research is to obtain temperature sensitive                   
              yeast mutants in which mRNA exit from the nucleus is blocked at                
              the restrictive temperature.  After mutagenesis of selected yeast              
              strains, mutants will be selected through a series of screening                
              procedures designed to eliminate those which are simply                        
              temperature sensitive for protein synthesis or amino acid uptake,              
              and to identify those which continue to synthesize mRNA but do                 
              not allow it to exit the nucleus at the non-permissive                         
              temperature.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              Although transport of molecules into and out of the cell nucleus               
              is critical for the life of a cell, the mechanisms regulating                  
              such transport are not understood.  Furthermore, despite the                   
              central importance of messenger-RNA exit for all eukaryotic                    
              cells, a genetic approach to this fundamental problem of cell                  
              function has not previously been taken.  Success in obtaining                  
              temperature sensitive messenger-RNA exit mutants would therefore               
              provide important new tools that would permit analysis of the                  
              molecular basis of this process.
