Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The principal investigator will conduct research in an area               
              of mathematics which involves differential geometry and several                
              complex variables.  The problems to be investigated concern the                
              intrinsic geometry of convex domains based on rescaling and                    
              distortion theorems, compact complex manifolds and harmonic maps,              
              and canonical structures on the boundary of hyperbolic space.                  
                   The research to be conducted by the principal investigator                
              involves differential geometry, convexity, and the theory of                   
              several complex variables.  The first is an outgrowth of Newton's              
              calculus and involves rates of change on surfaces.  The second is              
              the study of shapes which have no indentations.  And the third is              
              an area of analysis where functions have more than one                         
              independent complex variable instead of several real variables,                
              as is the usual.
