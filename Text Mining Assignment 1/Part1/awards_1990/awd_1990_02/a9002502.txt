Abstract    :
                   This research project concerns multi-dimensional statistical              
              analysis.  The project supports work in multivariate                           
              distributions and, in particular, theoretical considerations,                  
              dependency properties, orderings and approximations of                         
              multivariate distributions, extensions of univariate                           
              distributions to higher dimensions, nonparametric families and                 
              families with marginals as parameters                                          
                   This research is in the general area of statistics.   Multi-              
              dimensional statistical analysis has many applications including               
              Urn models which are used to model the contagion process, and                  
              shock models used in the context of reliability theory.
