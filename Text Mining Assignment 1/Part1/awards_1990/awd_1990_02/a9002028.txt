Abstract    :
              This project will attempt to the analysis of neural nets to                    
              incorporate synaptic delay and also use recent results to analyze              
              large amplitude behavior of simple neural nets.  The behavior                  
              large numbers of coupled nonlinear oscillators will be analyzed                
              as a model for synchrony.  Models of aggregation and branching                 
              will be studied both numerically and analytically.  Work on                    
              models for corticotopic maps will continue.  Most of the                       
              problems involve nonlinear integro-differential equations and                  
              how they apply to biological phenomena.  The PI's will also                    
              continue their studies of a nonlinear fourth order boundary value              
              problem which models fluid flow past a stretching sheet.  In                   
              addition studies of second order semilinear elliptic equations                 
              will be continued.  In particular the question of uniqueness of                
              solutions with prescribed numbers of zeros will be addressed.                  
              Finally, finite time blow-up in Schrodinger's equation will be                 
              investigated.
