              This is a SGER project to collect and to study                                 
              the perishable earthquake and structural                                       
              response/damage data due to the                                                
              October 17, 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake.                                       
                                                                                             
              This project aims to establish a complete                                      
              computerized data base of unreinforced masonry                                 
              (URM) buildings using a portfolio of 2,007                                     
              such buildings in San Francisco, to survey the                                 
              damage data, and to assess the accurate damage                                 
              to URMs in a consistent manner.                                                
                                                                                             
              This data base will be provided with                                           
              additional information such as soil                                            
              conditions, adjacent building conditions, and                                  
              street frontage to facilitate subsequent                                       
              analysis and other utilization.                                                
                                                                                             
              By individual field survey, sorting and                                        
              processing and in conjunction with a companion                                 
              effort of URMs evaluation program of the San                                   
              Francisco city, a complete pre-earthquake/post                                 
              earthquake damage data base will be produced.                                  
                                                                                             
              Statistical summaries of the results will be                                   
              documented and made available to the public,                                   
              along with a description of the field data                                     
              base and its possibilities.                                                    
                                                                                             
              The collection and computerization of the data                                 
              base in this project will serve the needs of                                   
              researchers for purposes of mitigating URM                                     
              hazards in the future.
