Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Submillimeter Continuum Observations of Comets.                                
                                                                                             
              Dr. Jewitt will make a detailed investigation of the                           
              submillimeter continua of comets, using primarily the 15 meter                 
              diameter James Clerk Maxwell Telescope on Mauna Kea in Hawaii.                 
              The submillimeter wavelength region of the cometary continuum is               
              essentially unexplored.  Only a small number of comets have yet                
              been observed in the millimeter and submillimeter regions of the               
              spectrum.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              The submillimeter continuum from comets is produced by thermal                 
              emission from the nucleus and from large grains in the coma.  The              
              large grains present a small fraction of the total cross section               
              in cometary dust, but they may carry a large fraction of the                   
              total grain mass.  Therefore, measurements of the large grains                 
              are of unique value in the study of the mass production rates of               
              comets.
