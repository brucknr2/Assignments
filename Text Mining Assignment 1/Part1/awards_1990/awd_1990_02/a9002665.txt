Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will study certain random                      
              phenomena using ideas from geometry, especially convex geometry.               
              The latter will provide spatial insight together with novel                    
              analytical tools.  Among the questions to be considered are                    
              certain features of Gaussian processes, hypothesis testing of                  
              directional data, random matrices, a spatial median, random                    
              curve models, and a new approach, to statistical theory of shape.              
              Applications of the investigator's work will be to image                       
              processing and biology.
