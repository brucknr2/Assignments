Abstract    :
              A new aerosol process for producing nanometer scale ceramic                    
              oxide particles with controllable degree of aggregation was                    
              tested in Phase I of this project.  During Phase II, the                       
              process will be extended by generating different nanometer                     
              size crystalline materials (titania, zirconia, etc.) and                       
              developing reliable techniques to control the degree of                        
              aggregation.  The investigation will incorporate a study of                    
              continuous processing, testing for improved sintering                          
              characteristics, and economical evaluation of the process.                     
                                                                                             
              It is expected that the nanometer scale ceramic particles                      
              produced by the proposed process will find numerous                            
              applications in engine components, machine parts and high                      
              temperature gas turbines.
