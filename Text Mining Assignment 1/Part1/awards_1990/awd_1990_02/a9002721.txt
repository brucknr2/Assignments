              This is a SGER project to collect and to study                                 
              the perishable earthquake and structural                                       
              response/damage data due to the                                                
              October 17, 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake.                                       
                                                                                             
              Work underway in this project is to collect                                    
              and analyze damage data of the San Francisco                                   
              Bay Bridge due to the October 17, 1989                                         
              earthquake.  Such data is rapidly disappearing                                 
              during the intensive repairing process                                         
              commenced immediately after the upper deck                                     
              failure.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              In cooperation with the California Department                                  
              of Transportation (Caltrans), extremely                                        
              valuable data on severely damaged bridge                                       
              elements including the collapsed deck has been                                 
              recovered and continues to be collected.  This                                 
              body of engineering data will be processed and                                 
              analyzed.  A report of such information,                                       
              including the implication to the bridge                                        
              response and design consideration will be                                      
              prepared.
