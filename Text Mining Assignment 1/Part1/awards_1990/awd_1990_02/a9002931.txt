Abstract    :
              While warped disks and gaseous rings of spiral galaxies are rare,              
              where they exist they can be powerful diagnostics of dynamical                 
              processes which apply in all galaxies.  They are also being                    
              discovered with increasing frequency.  This grant provides partial             
              support for an international conference of active workers studying             
              these puzzling objects.  The proximity of the Pittsburgh                       
              Supercomputing Center to the meeting is expected to stimulate                  
              fruitful interactions between specialists in numerical simulation              
              and observers, particularly those specializing in studies of the               
              motion and distribution of neutral hydrogen.
