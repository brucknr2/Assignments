Abstract    :
                The long-term goals of this research is to advance the theory of             
              nonlinear 0-1 programming, to design efficient algorithms for the              
              main type of such problems arising in engineering and to make largely          
              available the corresponding codes.  Further investigations will be             
              undertaken towards the improvement of exact and heuristic solution             
              methods for unconstrained, constrained and hyperbolic nonlinear 0-1            
              programs, and their application to reasoning under uncertainty in              
              expert systems (probabilistic logic) and to machine load balancing             
              problems in flexible manufacturing.                                            
                Interactive activities include teaching preceptorial courses on Case         
              Studies in Operations Research and on Integer Programming and giving           
              guest lectures.  Additionally, Dr. Jaumard will lead seminars on               
              recent research problems.                                                      
                This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to                
              provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in                    
              engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and             
              (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering            
              by providing greater visibility for women scientists and engineers             
              employed in industry, government, and academic institutions.  By               
              encouraging the participation of women in science, it is a valuable            
              investment in the Nation's future scientific vitality.
