Abstract    :
              Dr. Joseph Noel has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research                       
              Fellowship in Chemistry.  Dr. Noel's doctoral degree was from                  
              Ohio State University under the direction of Professor Ming-Daw                
              Tsai.  Dr. Noel intends to continue research at Yale University                
              under the sponsorship of Professor Paul Sigler.  Dr. Noel's                    
              area of postdoctoral research will be the elucidation of the                   
              structural basis for enzymic catalytic mechanisms as revealed                  
              largely by x-ray crystallography. He will be crystallizing the                 
              membrane photoreceptor protein, rhodopsin.  The experience                     
              gained from this study should facilitate longer-range studies                  
              of the structure, chemistry and evolution of chorismate mutase.                
                                                                                             
              The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as                 
              an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the                   
              knowledge and experience of new Ph.D's and attract them into                   
              meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and                       
              teaching.
