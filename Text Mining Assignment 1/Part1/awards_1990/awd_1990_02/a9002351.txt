Abstract    :
                   Job scheduling in a multiprocessing system can be broken down             
              into two major components; the processor allocation problem which              
              determines the number of processors that should be allocated to a              
              particular job, and the processor assignment problem which determines          
              the physical assignment of the allocated processor to the parallel             
              tasks in a job.  this research will study these two issues based on            
              analytical models, simulation and experiments on some existing                 
              multiprocessing systems.  the research thus involves finding a                 
              suitable characterization of jobs based on which the processor                 
              allocation problem can be formulated, identifying the appropriate              
              performance indices and obtaining the allocation strategies that will          
              optimize these indices, formulating the processor assignment problem           
              considering both precedence relations and the communication among              
              tasks into account, developing heuristic algorithms to generate                
              assignment which will minimize the job execution time, and performing          
              experiments on real multiprocessing systems to determine the                   
              applicability of the allocation and assignment strategies and to study         
              their effect on the performance of the multiprocessing system.
