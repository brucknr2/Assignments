Abstract    :
              The objective of this research is to study experimentally the                  
              plasma oscillations in the electron gas confined in wide,                      
              remotely-doped AlGaAs heterostructure wells.  This novel solid                 
              state plasma, with a spatially-tunable density distribution and                
              with sufficiently high elctron mobilities, presents the                        
              opportunity to observe well-defined plasmas for temperatures                   
              below and well above the degeneracy temperature (approximately 20              
              K).  These systems have the advantage that the potential that                  
              confines the electrons is smooth on the scale of the Thomas-Fermi              
              screening length, meaning results can be compared with "jellium"               
              theories that are not complicated by the strong, rapidly varying               
              ionic potentials in bulk semiconductors and metallic plasmas.                  
              The PI plans to use visible-light scattering and far-infrared                  
              spectroscopy to probe the effects of density gradients in the                  
              electron layer on the plasma modes.
