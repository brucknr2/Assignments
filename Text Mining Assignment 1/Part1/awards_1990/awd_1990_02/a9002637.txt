Abstract    :
              Dr. David Leitner has been awarded a Postdoctoral Fellowship in                
              Chemistry.  Dr. Leitner's doctoral degree was from the                         
              University of Chicago under the supervision of Professor R.                    
              Stephen Berry.  Dr. Leitner intends to continue research at the                
              University of Heidelberg under the sponsorship of Professor                    
              Lorenz Cederbaum.  Dr. Leitner's area of postdoctoral research                 
              and training will be theoretical studies dealing with the                      
              calculation of vibronically-coupled spectra.  Longer term, he                  
              plans to apply these studies to the calculation of spectra of                  
              non-Born-Oppenheimer systems such as the methane cation.                       
                                                                                             
              The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as                 
              an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the                   
              knowledge and experience of new Ph.Ds and attract them into                    
              meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and                       
              teaching.
