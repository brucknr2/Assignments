Abstract    :
              This award will support collaborative research between Professor               
              Keith Pannell of the University of Texas at El Paso and Professor              
              Jorge Cervantes of the Universidad de Guanajuato in Guanajuato,                
              Mexico.  The investigators will study the synthesis of transition              
              metal complexes containing Si-Si, Si-Ge, and Ge-Ge bonds and their             
              photochemical, mass spectral fragmentation, and electrochemical                
              properties investigated.                                                       
                                                                                             
              Such studies will provide the first insight into the capacity of               
              germanium to participate in various processes and rearrangements               
              noted for oligosilyl complexes.  Furthermore, the results will                 
              illustrate the ability of these complexes to undergo various redox             
              processes.  Synthesis, structural, photochemical, and multi-                   
              nuclear NMR studies will be performed at the University of Texas               
              at El Paso, Texas, while mass spectral analysis and electrochemical            
              studies will be performed at the Universidad de Guanajuato,                    
              Guanajuato, Mexico.
