Abstract    :
              In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program                 
              of the Chemistry Division, Professor Durig, a world-renowned                   
              spectrscopist will organize the Twelfth International                          
              Conference on Raman Spectroscopy.  This conference will bring                  
              together spectroscopists and theoreticians from all corners of                 
              the world, and the NSF support will provide funds specifically                 
              earmarked to facilitate the participation of graduate students                 
              and postdoctorals.                                                             
                                                                                             
              The meeting, with an expected participation of 500 scientists,                 
              will be held at the University of South Carolina, and will be                  
              comprised of plenary lectures, invited talks, and poster
