Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Dr. Low will attempt to map out the portion of the cholinergic                 
              receptor molecule which binds to a toxin.  The technique involves              
              forming covalent bonds between the toxin and identified peptide                
              sequences of the receptors, using a photoreactive group inserted               
              in the peptides.  This approach is new and if successful, can be               
              used to probe the properties of other receptor molecules.
