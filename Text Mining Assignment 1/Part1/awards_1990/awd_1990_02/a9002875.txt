Abstract    :
                   Professor Silva will study nonsingular joinings in ergodic                
              theory.  Nonsingular joinings, a concept introduced by D.                      
              Rudolph and studied previously by Silva and Rudolph, will play a               
              pivotal role in Silva's study of nonsingular infinite measure-                 
              preserving transformations.                                                    
                   This project involves research in ergodic theory.  Ergodic                
              theory in general concerns understanding the average behavior of               
              systems whose dynamics is too complicated or chaotic to be                     
              followed in microscopic detail.  Usually ergodic theory involves               
              a dynamics which preserves a natural probability measure.                      
              Professor Silva's research concerns systems where this nice                    
              property fails to hold.
