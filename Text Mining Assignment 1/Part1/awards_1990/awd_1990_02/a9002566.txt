Abstract    :
                   This research will involve spline functions.  Spline                      
              functions and their various generalizations in several variables               
              have proved to be very useful for building empirical models which              
              describe multivariate physical phenomena in large data sets.  The              
              general approach of this project is to develop theoretical                     
              properties of the proposed semi-parametric models, to assess how               
              well they might be expected to work in practice by Monte Carlo                 
              simulation studies, and finally, to try the methods on selected                
              "real" experimental data sets.                                                 
                   This project is in the general area of statistics and                     
              focuses on high speed computing.  The spline function models need              
              new statistical and numerical techniques to let the data select                
              from among various possible models, to fit these models, and to                
              provide as much information as possible on how accurate the model              
              forecast are likely to be.  Most of this research is supported by              
              AFSOR and NASA.  This award supports a graduate student to work                
              in the project.
