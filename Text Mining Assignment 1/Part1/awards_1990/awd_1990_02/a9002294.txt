Abstract    :
              This award will support a six-month research visit by Professor                
              Mostafa A. Foda of the Department of Civil Engineering, University             
              of California, Berkeley, to the laboratories of Professor Tetsuo               
              Sakai, Department of Civil Engineering, Kyoto University, and                  
              Professor Yoshi-Hiko Maeno, Department of Civil Engineering,                   
              Maizaru College of Technology, Japan.  The research will focus on              
              coastal engineering and porous media dynamics, in particular the               
              generation mechanisms of multiphase wave in fluid-filled porous                
              media.  Experiments will be conducted on two of the most promising             
              mechanisms of generation, one being relevant to earthquake shaking             
              of soil masses; and the other to the phenomena of seabed lique-                
              faction by ocean waves.  The results are expected to increase our              
              understanding of the interaction of seabed, ocean waves and                    
              earthquakes.
