Abstract    :
              This one-year grant will permit Dr. Yuille and one student to                  
              extend their preliminary work in representation and visual                     
              recognition of human faces.  Their current system can locate                   
              strong features such as eyes and mouths by using parametric                    
              adaptation of deformable templates.  They are now applying robust              
              statistical methods to identification of partially occluded or                 
              unresolved features, and will also study pyramid algorithms for                
              matching a global face template.  The goal is robust face                      
              recognition in the presence of noise and distractions.
