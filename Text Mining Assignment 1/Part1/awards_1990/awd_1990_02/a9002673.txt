Abstract    :
                   Let L be an oriented link type in the oriented 3-sphere, S3,              
              and let L and L', defined respectively by closed n- and m-braid                
              diagrams, represent L.  The investigator is primarily concerned                
              with understanding how it is possible to jump between conjugacy                
              classes without stabilization.  This is one of the technical                   
              questions involved in understanding how a finite collection of                 
              (possibly knotted) simple closed curves in 3-dimensional space                 
              can be linked with one another.
