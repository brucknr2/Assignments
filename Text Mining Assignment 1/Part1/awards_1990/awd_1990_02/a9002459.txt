Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a SGER project to collect and to study                                 
              the perishable earthquake and structural                                       
              response/damage data due to the                                                
              October 17, 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake.                                       
                                                                                             
              The lifeline systems gaslines, sewer lines                                     
              electric transmission and power systems etc.                                   
              in the San Francisco area sustained                                            
              considerable damage and service disruption                                     
              during the October 17, 1989 earthquake.  As a                                  
              result it provides excellent opportunity to                                    
              assess the safety and service operation of                                     
              such vital systems, which service the city and                                 
              community.  this project is to collect and                                     
              evaluate data resulting from this particular                                   
              earthquake or endurance and damage of water                                    
              and sewage facilities.                                                         
                                                                                             
              The tasks to be conducted include: (1) damage                                  
              inventory for general damage level, (2)                                        
              inventory of all system facilities and                                         
              identify earthquake design criteria for those                                  
              facilities, (3) identify local geotechnical                                    
              data, (4) inventory systems endurance and                                      
              damage, and (5) develop loss algorithms for                                    
              facility components and identify successful                                    
              design solutions.                                                              
                                                                                             
              The project will establish a comprehensive                                     
              data base and provide in-depth insight into                                    
              complex issues on the seismic safety, loss,                                    
              service restoration and repair of the water                                    
              and sewage lifeline systems.
