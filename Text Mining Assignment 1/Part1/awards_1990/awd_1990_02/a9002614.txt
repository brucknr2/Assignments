Abstract    :
              This research concerns fault-tolerant cellular automata (FTCA).  Such          
              automata require generally elaborate constructions. The notions                
              introduced in previous years enable us to make the newer costructions          
              much more transparent. All known FTCA rely heavily on the fact that            
              the cells of the whole array update simultaneously.  FTCA with                 
              asynchronous updation are being constructed.  All known FTCA in                
              dimensions lower than 3 must be prepared in an elaborate, hierarchical         
              initial configuration.  Techniques for building a FTCA without this            
              requirement are being investigated.  In this homogenous medium,                
              arbitrarily complex noise-resistant structures arise spontaneously.            
              The complexity is understood in the sense of carrying out complex              
              computational tasks.  The mathematical possibility of such a medium            
              is significant for physics and biology as well as computer science.            
              The computational and informational costs of all constructions are             
              generally found to be near the theoretical minimum.
