Abstract    :
              Single crystal x-ray crystallography is the most powerful                      
              analytical method for structure determination of solids.  In                   
              synthetic inorganic, organic, bioinorganic and organometallic                  
              chemistry, single crystal x-ray diffraction is an invaluable                   
              tool for the characterization of molecular structure. Knowledge                
              of molecular composition and structure helps in the development                
              of new reactions of potentially general interest in catalysis                  
              or synthesis.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              This award from the Chemical Instrumentation Program will help
