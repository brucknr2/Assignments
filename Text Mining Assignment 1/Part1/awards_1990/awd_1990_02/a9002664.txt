Abstract    :
              High Speed Signal Processing is an important application of special            
              purpose numerical processor designs.  These digital processing                 
              systems involve interconnecting complex integrated circuits or a               
              large self-contained VLSI design; both implementations contain                 
              dense electronic structures susceptible to internal temporary and              
              permanent failures.  Such systems are difficult to protect                     
              sufficiently by classical fault-tolerant computer design methods               
              even though these systems also process numerical based data.  This             
              research examines new methods for introducing efficient fault-                 
              tolerant design methods in linear signal processing systems without            
              degrading high speed performance.  The approach is based on block              
              and convolutional codes used in communication applications for                 
              error detection/correction in data sequences.  Four specific                   
              research topics are addressed in this work.  One topic involves the            
              study of new design and modification options for real block and                
              convolutional codes, while another examines the coverage for this              
              type of algorithmic fault-tolerance.  Practical CAD implementations            
              are made to provide a basis for assessing overhead complexities.               
              Software tools to aid designers in incorporating fault-tolerance               
              easily within practical systems are also developed.
