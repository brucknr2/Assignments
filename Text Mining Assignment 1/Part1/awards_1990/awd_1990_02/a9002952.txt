Abstract    :
                   In this project the principal investigators will analyze                  
              systems of differential equations whose solutions model several                
              types of reactive thermal explosions.  In particular, they will                
              study the qualitative properties of solutions of initial-boundary              
              value problems that describe the evolution of diffusive and                    
              nondiffusive thermal explosions in finite domains.  The goal of                
              this investigation is to predict precisely where and when                      
              explosions will occur and to study how the solution behaves as the             
              blow-up time approaches.                                                       
              Combustion phenomena are common in many aspects of our daily lives;            
              think of cars, kitchens, heating systems, rocket and missile                   
              engines.  A large amount of computer power is brought to bear upon             
              the systems of partial differential equations that describe                    
              combustion and explosion phenomena, but very often a great deal of             
              insight can be obtained from a mathematical analysis of the                    
              governing equations.  For example, in this project the principal               
              investigators will attempt to predict where and when an explosion              
              will occur in a confined space by means of a judicious use of                  
              a'priori estimates and bounding functions.
