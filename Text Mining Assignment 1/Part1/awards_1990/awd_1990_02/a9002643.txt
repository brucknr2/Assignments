Abstract    :
                   Solar wind plasma speed, the interplanetary magnetic field,               
              the geomagnetic field, and the galactic cosmic ray intensity near              
              the Earth all vary periodically in response to solar rotation.                 
              This study addresses specifically the problem of defining                      
              observationally the strength and period of recurrence in lists of              
              impulsive events.  The analysis strategy is to determine the                   
              frequency with which events are separated by a given time                      
              interval.  Comparison of this frequency with that expected for                 
              events which occur randomly establishes the significance of the                
              periodicities observed.  Specifically, the analysis of interevent              
              intervals in K-coronal data will compare the differential                      
              rotation of bright and dark coronal regions.  With these coronal               
              results, analysis of intervals between fast solar wind streams                 
              locates a mean latitude of origin for the solar stimulus for                   
              interplanetary recurrence. Impulsive geomagnetic disturbances as               
              a proxy for interplanetary shocks, and their recurrence                        
              properties will be compared with similar analyses of recurrent                 
              cosmic ray variations.  Longer term recurrence of geomagnetic                  
              disturbance will decide if there are terrestrial effects of the                
              recently reported 150 day periodicity in solar flares.
