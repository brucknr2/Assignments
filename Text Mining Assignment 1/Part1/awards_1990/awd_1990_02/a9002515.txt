Abstract    :
              This award will support Professor Martha Rees of Baylor University             
              in a research collaboration with Professor Ana Paula de Teresa of              
              the Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana de Iztapalapa, Mexico.                  
              The investigators intend to address the issue of how do peasant                
              households reproduce themselves, not only biologically, but                    
              economically and socially as well, in the fact of adverse                      
              conditions posed by the expansion of the market.  Data collected               
              in the Central Valley of Oaxaca, Mexico will permit a diachronic               
              and a synchronic analysis of the effect of external factors (e.g.,             
              market) on internal household structure and organization--the                  
              reverse of Chayanov's model in which internal needs determine                  
              peasant production.  Data include genealogies and work and                     
              reproductive histories to be summed in matrices by chronological               
              year and household age.  Results will show changes in consumer/                
              worker ratio, division of labor, expulsion or retention of                     
              household members (via marriage or migration), changing productive             
              and subsistence activities, and demographic behavior.                          
                                                                                             
              The collaborators have experience with the field training of                   
              graduate and undergraduate students in Anthropology. Such training             
              will be an integral part of this research as much of the data                  
              collecting and analysis will be performed by graduate and                      
              undergraduate students in Mexico and the United States.
