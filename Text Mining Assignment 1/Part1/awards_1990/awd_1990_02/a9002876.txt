Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research in analytic number theory                
              of Professor Julia Mueller of Fordham University. Dr. Mueller                  
              will be conducting studies in diophantine approximation over both              
              function fields and number fields. In the number-field case, she               
              hopes to reformulate Siegel's conjecture so that all the                       
              parameters will be invariant under the special linear group, and               
              thereby to get much more precise statements on the relationship                
              between the coefficients and the number of solutions of the                    
              equations under consideration.                                                 
                   The field of analytic number theory applies to the discrete               
              realm of the whole numbers the techniques of analysis, dependent               
              on the notions of continuity and limit, originating in calculus.               
              The idea of using continuous methods to investigate the discrete               
              is two centuries old, but with the work of the modern analytic                 
              number theorists such as Professor Mueller, the field has had a                
              new rebirth.
