Abstract    :
              Travel support is to be granted to a selected number of US                     
              participants invited to give presentations at a Symposium on                   
              Nonlinear Hydrodynamic Stability and Transition, to be held in                 
              France on September 3 - 8, 1990.  Younger and less known

              The symposium is sponsored by the International Union of                       
              Theoretical and Applied Mechanics, and the support from NSF is                 
              shared by a variety of other sources.
