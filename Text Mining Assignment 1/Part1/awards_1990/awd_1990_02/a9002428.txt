Abstract    :
                   Recursive query languages such as Datalog make "knowledge-base"           
              systems highly expressive.  However, such languages are difficult to           
              compile into efficient code.  This project will combine work on high           
              level program transformations with techniques developed for logic              
              databases to produce a Datalog compiler that will give cleaner and             
              more efficient code than has been currently reported.  In particular,          
              transformations will be used that translate systems of fixed point             
              equations into procedural programs that are further improved by finite         
              differencing (a transformation that uncovers and implements critical           
              invariants).  The resulting code would then be amenable to more                
              conventional optimization techniques.  Two other related problems will         
              be investigated, (1) to give the compiler the capability to analyze            
              performance mechanically; and (2) to incrementally compute relations           
              recursively defined in Datalog clauses.
