Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              An open International Conference on the Sodium Pump is planned for             
              September 5-9, 1990, at the Marine Biological Laboratory, Woods Hole,          
              MA.  It is the sixth in a series of triennial meetings, the third held         
              in the U.S., and the first sponsored by the Society of General                 
              Physiologists.  The pace of research on the sodium pump is                     
              accelerating.  The conference will offer a timely opportunity for              
              experts in these not (yet) overlapping fields to compare notes in an           
              intensive five-day discussion, and to disseminate their conclusions to         
              an audience much wider than the participants or the Society's                  
              membership, in particular, to colleagues working on other members of           
              the E1-E2 transport ATPase family.  Five major themes will be covered:         
              (1) Molecular Biology of the Sodium Pump; (2) Structural Studies both          
              empirical and theoretical; (3) Conformational Changes and Ion                  
              Occlusion; (4) Detailed steady-state and presteady-state ("fast")              
              kinetics of the various pump modes; and (5) Electrogenicity and voltage        
              dependence with emphasis on identifying the voltage sensitive step(s).         
              Twenty-seven, including thirteen non-U.S., speakers have been invited          
              to present comprehensive critical reviews of their own work and that of        
              others, and to write a chapter for the proceedings.
