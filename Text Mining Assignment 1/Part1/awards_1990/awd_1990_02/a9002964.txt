Abstract    :
                The control of queueing (service) systems is increasingly important          
              in the areas of communication systems, computer networks, and                  
              manufacturing.  It is desired to determine control policies that are           
              optimal and easy to implement.  Underlying many queueing control               
              problems is a mathematical structure known as a Markov decision                
              process (MDP).  Dr. Sennott will establish the existence of optimal            
              policies in general state space MDPs, in partially observable MDPs, in         
              MDPs with constraints, and in stochastic games.  Lastly, she will              
              study finite state approximations for infinite state MDPs.  Examples           
              illustrate the applicability of each topic to the control of queueing          
              systems.  The methods employed will be extensions of her developments          
              (1989a, b, c).                                                                 
                Interactive activities include teaching "Modeling with Stochastic            
              Processes" and "Queueing Theory," and attending and speaking at                
              departmental and graduate student seminars.                                    
                This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to                
              provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in                    
              engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and             
              (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering by         
              providing greater visibility for women scientists and engineers                
              employed in industry, government, and academic institutions.  By               
              encouraging the participation of women in science, it is a valuable            
              investment in the Nation's future scientific vitality.
