Abstract    :
                 This project will develop analytical and numerical studies                  
              directed at hybrid computational schemes that use Lagrangian                   
              augmentation technology to treat problems with intricate                       
              constraints implicitly, and gradient projection methods to                     
              handle simpler constraints explicitly.  These studies are                      
              motivated by questions in optimal control where there is the need              
              to solve large systems of equations subject to contraints with                 
              special mathematical structures.  Optimal control problems arise               
              naturally in engineering and natural sciences.
