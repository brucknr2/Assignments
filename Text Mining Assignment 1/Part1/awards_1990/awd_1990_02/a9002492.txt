Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Research to explore the physical properties of strongly                        
              interacting many-electron systems is proposed.  The problems of                
              superconductivity near the metal-insulator transition of the two-              
              dimensional Hubbard model and the two-dimensional electron-phonon              
              Holstein model will be studied.  In addition, work on dynamic                  
              impurities in metals, periodic Anderson and Kondo lattices is                  
              proposed.  A common feature of these problems is the need to use               
              non-perturbative procedures such as numerical simulation or                    
              infinite-order diagrammatic approximations.  This work aims at                 
              combining numerical simulations and analytic many-body                         
              techniques.
