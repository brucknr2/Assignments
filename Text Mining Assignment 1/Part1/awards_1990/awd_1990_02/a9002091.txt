Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is             
              in the general area of materials chemistry and in the subfield                 
              metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD).  The goal of this              
              activity is the development of volatile MOCVD reagents for use in              
              the fabrication of tellurium alloy thin films.  Mercury cadmium                
              telluride (MCT) has important potential applications as a material             
              for passive infrared detectors.  MOCVD of MCT necessitates                     
              development of new tellurium element source reagents with                      
              increased volatility and lower growth temperatures.                            
                                                                                             
              During the tenure of Phase I research under NSF grant ISI-8860518,             
              a new class of compounds, trifluoromethyl(alkyl)tellurides, was                
              synthesized via a novel ligand exchange reaction.  These compounds             
              were shown to have a significantly higher volatility and                       
              comparable decomposition temperatures to the best reagents                     
              currently available.                                                           
                                                                                             
              In this Phase II study, large scale syntheses of these compounds               
              will be developed and they will be used as Te source reagents for              
              the growth of CdTe films.  The physical and electrical properties              
              of the films will be determined.  Simultaneously, further work                 
              will be done to elucidate the pyrolysis mechanisms of the                      
              trifluoromethyl(alkyl)tellurides and the mechanism of the ligand               
              exchange reaction.  This information, combined with the film                   
              growth studies, should allow determination of the optimum source               
              reagent and the development of a large scale, high purity                      
              synthesis of that compound.
