Abstract    :
              In addition to the mathematical aspects of the  work, the                      
              project has the potential for wide impact on the scientific                    
              community through the development of a comprehensive computer                  
              environment for the exploration of dynamical systems.  The                     
              intention is to provide the user of this environment with                      
              interactive, efficient access  to all currently available                      
              algorithms for studying the dynamics of general systems together               
              with the tools for effectively managing the data produced in                   
              these studies.  A prototype for such an environment has been                   
              developed in the context of the first problem listed above, but                
              further work is required to produce a package that meets the                   
              needs of a broad spectrum of applications and users.  These                    
              further developments will occur in conjunction with studies of                 
              problems of significant theoretical interest.
