Abstract    :
                                                                                              
               The overall goal of this project is to foster current and                    
              future academic and research network communications between the                
              U.S. and Europe.  In this regard, support will continue for the                
              existing 56 kbps data communications link connecting the U.S.                  
              research and academic networks (NSFNET, NASA, Science Internet,                
              Energy Sciences Network, etc.,) to networks used by scientic                   
              communities in France and, in the near future, Switzerland.  This              
              will enable continuation of service, based on TCP/IP in France                 
              and Switzerland, to scientists in these countries wishing to                   
              communicate for purposes of scientific collaboration or to access              
              unique computer-based resources.  The world-class SIMBAD                       
              astronomical data base, maintained by the Strasbourg (France)                  
              Stellar Data Center on a computer near Paris, is an example of a               
              unique resource of great importance to U.S. and for support                    
              personnel at Princeton University.  The French National Research               
              Institute for Informatics and Automatics (INRIA) participates by               
              paying the French share of the circuit costs and by maintaining                
              the communications gateway at their Sophia-Antipolis campus.***//
