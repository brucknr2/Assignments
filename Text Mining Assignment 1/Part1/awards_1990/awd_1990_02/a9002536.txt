Abstract    :
              This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program of the Chemistry                  
              Division and the Polymers Program of the Division of Materials                 
              Research supports the continuing work of Professor Green and Dr.               
              Levon at the Polytechnic University. The results of this research              
              will give new understanding and insight to the right or left hand              
              helical nature of polymers. The factors that control the                       
              preferential formation of right- or left- handed helices will be               
              explored. Since bio-polymers, such as peptides and DNA, can exist              
              in right- or left- handed helices, this work is of particular                  
              interest.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              Drs. Green and Levon will provide new and important information in             
              three areas, of which all are related to how the chirality of the              
              monomers effect the helical chirality of the polymers. In the                  
              first area, the effect of a chiral center on the chiral helicity               
              of isocyanate polymers will be studied. It has been found that a               
              chiral center by virtue of deuterium substitution in R-1-                      
              deuteriohexylisocyanate had a profound effect on the helical                   
              chirality of the polyisocyanate. This observation will be studied              
              further as well as the helical chirality of the polymer resulting              
              from R-2-deuteriohexylisocyanate. In the second area, a study will             
              be made of the relationship between helical twist of a side chain              
              containing a biphenyl group in an N-carboxyanhydride monomer and               
              helicity of the polyglutamate polymer. In the third area, the                  
              gelation of polyisocyanides as function of the stereochemistry of              
              the monomer will be investigated.
