Abstract    :
                   The CEDAR ( Coupling, Energetics and Dynamics of Atmospheric              
              Regions) program is very much concerned with both the development              
              of modern state of the art optical instruments and detectors and               
              the quality and analysis of the atmospheric data that they                     
              produce. This project will employ a newly developed Fabry-Perot                
              interferometer which uses a bare-CCD detector to study the                     
              temperature and winds of the upper mesosphere and lower                        
              thermosphere.  This in turn will be used to validate current                   
              global circulation models. This is a continuation of a program                 
              initiated in 1989 and promises to effectively contribute to our                
              understanding of this atmospheric region and the modern                        
              techniques for studying this region.***
