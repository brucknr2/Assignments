Abstract    :
              Research on chemical reactions on miscible polymer blends is an                
              area in which the opportunities for morphological control on top               
              of chemical reactivity have important implications in regard to                
              final materials properties, especially in polymer blends having                
              critical solution temperatures where changes in reaction                       
              temperature affect miscibility, phase separation, and chemical                 
              reactivity.  Oxidative studies will be carried out on miscible                 
              blends of poly(styrene) (PS) and poly(vinyl methyl ether) (PVME).              
              PVME photo-oxidizes and thermo-oxidizes much more readily than                 
              polystyrene -- allowing for large differences in reactivity with               
              oxygen.  Prior studies have indicated that the rates of oxygen                 
              uptake by the homopolymers are significantly different than that               
              of the blends.  The research will involve - understanding the                  
              mechanistic chemical aspects of the oxidative stabilization                    
              phenomena for PS/PVME blends by use of model compounds,                        
              additional studies on the degradation products directly obtained               
              from their oxidation experiments on the polymer systems, the                   
              effect of specific interactions such as hydrogen bonding on                    
              miscibility and oxidative aging in these systems, extension of                 
              these concepts into other systems, and the effect of added                     
              antioxidants and their distribution.
