Abstract    :
              In this SGER grant in the Theoretical and Computational Program                
              of the Chemistry Division, Professor Adamowicz will develop new                
              techniques dealing with the detailed interactions among the                    
              motions of electrons and nuclei in atoms and molecules.  The                   
              new techniques will then be applied to obtain an understanding                 
              of highly energetic species.                                                   
                                                                                             
              The PI will develop a new approach to treating the                             
              Born-Oppenheimer breakdown, using a non-adiabatic basis set and                
              a variational functional for the total energy of the system.                   
              Instead of a rigorous separation of the internal and external                  
              motions, the new method is based on forcing the system to stop                 
              its translation in space and assume the desired rotational                     
              state by introducing penalty operators into the variational                    
              functional.
