Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research in number theory of                      
              Professors Carl Pomerance and Helmut Maier of the University of                
              Georgia. Dr. Pomerance's research will center on integer                       
              factoring algorithms and studies of the distribution in                        
              arithmetic progressions of integers with no large prime factor as              
              well as properties of the sequence of divisors of an integer. Dr               
              Maier's project is to continue his work on irregularities in the               
              distribution of prime numbers in short intervals, and also to                  
              study the coefficients of the cyclotomic polynomials.                          
                   Except for counting, number theory, which is the study of                 
              the properties of the whole numbers, is the oldest branch of                   
              mathematics. In modern days, problems in number theory have                    
              furnished the driving force to creation of new mathematics in the              
              fields of pure algebra, analysis, and geometry; some of the most               
              recent and most astonishing applications of number theory have                 
              appeared in theoretical computer science and coding theory.
