Abstract    :
              This project studies various configurations of shared busses in a              
              Multistage Interconnection Network (MIN) based system in order to              
              maintain cache coherence.  These busses can be put separately or inside        
              the MIN switches.  It is also possible to avoid using shared busses by         
              redesigning a MIN switch to handle broadcasting.  The design and               
              analysis of these cache coherence protocols are the research objectives        
              of this project.  A thorough analysis and comparison of various                
              approaches can guide the future multiprocessor system designers in their       
              design process.                                                                
                                                                                             
              Multiprocessor organizations are generally defined based on their              
              processor memory interconnections.  MINs form a very suitable                  
              interconnection medium for building large scale multiprocessor systems.        
              The efficiency of these systems can be further enhanced by putting cache       
              memories with the processors to reduce the memory access demands.              
              However, such cache memories give rise to inconsistency of shared data         
              due to lack of coordination among the processors while changing their          
              shared cache contents.  A hardware solution to this problem is to              
              broadcast the state changes through a shared bus interconnection.  Since       
              MINs do not have a shared bus, maintaining cache coherence in MIN based        
              multiprocessors poses a serious challenge for research.
