Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This action is for a one-year extension to a                                   
              research program (BCS-8715450) supported by                                    
              NSF: the goal of this project is to develop a                                  
              better understanding of the destructive                                        
              action of a tsunami (seismic sea wave) as it                                   
              impacts a coastal zone.                                                        
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
              The extension expands the research scope; it                                   
              also provides an opportunity to reanalyze the                                  
              extensive quantity of laboratory experimental                                  
              data obtained during the past five years of                                    
              research.  The motivation for this extension                                   
              arises from the results obtained previously.                                   
              The objective is to develop a thorough                                         
              understanding of the fundamental behavior of                                   
              broken tsunami (bore) propagation up a                                         
              sloping beach; the tsunami actions at the                                      
              shore; and the ensuing runup and drawdown                                      
              processes.  These phenomena are fundamental                                    
              to an understanding of the destructive effect                                  
              of a tsunami as it reaches a coastal zone.
