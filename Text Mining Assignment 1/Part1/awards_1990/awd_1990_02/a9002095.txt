Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research in arithmetic algebraic                  
              geometry of Professor William McCallum of the University of                    
              Arizona. Dr. McCallum's project is to study the Shafarevich-Tate               
              group of elliptic curves and Abelian varieties defined over                    
              number fields in order to verify a number of conjectures of                    
              Kolyvagin. The elliptic curves under consideration will be                     
              modular, while the Abelian varieties to be studied will all be                 
              Jacobian varieties of Fermat curves.                                           
                   Arithmetic algebraic geometry is a subject that combines the              
              techniques of algebraic geometry and number theory. In its                     
              original formulation, algebraic geometry treated figures that                  
              could be defined in the plane by the simplest equations, namely                
              polynomials. Number theory started with the whole numbers and                  
              such questions as divisibility of one whole number by another.                 
              These two subjects, seemingly so far apart, have in fact                       
              influenced each other from the earliest times, but in the past                 
              quarter century the mutual influence has increased greatly. The                
              field of arithmetic algebraic geometry now uses techniques from                
              all of modern mathematics, and is having corresponding influence               
              beyond its own borders.
