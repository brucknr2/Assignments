Abstract    :
              Nets are widely used in the theory of concurrency.  One evident reason         
              for that is the convenience of visualizing the communication structure         
              of systems.  Nets seem to cover almost any situation which involves            
              "sharing" or communication.  For an engineer it could mean sharing of          
              component terminals by connecting them electrically; a mathematician           
              can consider sharing of variables in a system of equations or sharing          
              relations when they are composed.                                              
                                                                                             
              This is a research program into semantics of concurrent systems which          
              are based on the net concept.  Hopefully the expected results will             
              provide a reliable basis for design of such systems and reasoning              
              about them.  As a byproduct one can expect also more insight into the          
              semantics of nets in other "sharing situations".                               
                                                                                             
              Fundamental research will be carried out on semantics and proof                
              theory of networks of dataflow and other concurrent processes,                 
              emphasizing "causal" semantics to support refinement and atomicity of          
              process behavior.  The work will be carried out by Professor Boris A.          
              Trakhtenbrot of Tel Aviv University in collaboration with the                  
              Principal Investigator.
