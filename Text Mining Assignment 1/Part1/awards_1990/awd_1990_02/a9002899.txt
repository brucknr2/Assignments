Abstract    :
                   This award will support the training of graduate students                 
              in probability theory at the University of Minnesota.  The                     
              faculty consists of six well known researchers in various areas                
              of probability theory, who have a consistent tract record of                   
              training strong students.  This award will also support the post               
              doctoral research of Roger Tribe, who will conduct research in                 
              the area of super-processes.  These processes can be used to                   
              model the dispersion of certain species of individuals.
