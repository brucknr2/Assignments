Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research in deformation theory and                
              arithmetic groups of Professor John Millson of the University of               
              Maryland at College Park. Dr. Millson has proposed to work in two              
              main areas: first, he will apply the methods of rational homotopy              
              theory to deformation problems in algebraic geometry; and second,              
              he will continue his research on the cohomology of discrete                    
              subgroups of orthogonal and unitary groups.                                    
                   This is research in the field of algebraic geometry, one of               
              the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which has had a                
              revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century. In its                    
              origin, it treated figures that could be defined in the plane by               
              the simplest equations, namely polynomials. Nowadays the field                 
              makes use of methods not only from algebra, but from analysis and              
              topology, and conversely is finding application in those fields                
              as well as in physics, theoretical computer science, and                       
              robotics.
