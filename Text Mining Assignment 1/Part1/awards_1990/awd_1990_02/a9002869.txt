Abstract    :
              This Small Grant and Exploratory Research (SGER) proposal                      
              supports the research to assess the feasibility of isolating a                 
              specific enzyme, ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase and oxygenase               
              complex, from primitive microorganisms, which live within                      
              sandstone in the Ross Desert region of Antarctica.  These primitive            
              microbes include primary producers (lichens, green algae and                   
              blue-green algae) and primary consumers (bacteria, yeasts, and fungi)          
              and occasionally metabolize under extreme environmental conditions of          
              temperatures, light, moisture and inorganic nutrients.  The                    
              carboxylase-oxygenase system will be studied to determine whether it           
              has unique sequences in its amino acids which may contribute to its            
              ability to function under extreme environmental stress.  If unique             
              amino acid sequences are found, nucleotide sequences in the gene that          
              codes for this enzyme complex will be examined.  This information              
              should provide some understanding as to the evolutionary relatedness           
              of this enzyme compared to temperate species.
