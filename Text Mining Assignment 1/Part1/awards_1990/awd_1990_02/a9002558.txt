Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The phenomena of dislocation emission and movement in fiber-                   
              reinforced metals due to thermal expansion mismatch and                        
              deformation of the metal matrix by slip upon unidirectional                    
              straining is under study.  Silver halides (AgCl and AgBr) are                  
              used as model materials for investigating deformation in metal-                
              matrix composites.  Silver halides can decorate dislocations at                
              ambient temperatures, allow elastic stresses to be imaged by                   
              birefringence are transparent, and deform in a manner very                     
              similar to metals.  Detailed information is obtained in three                  
              dimensions about the stress field and dislocation structure in                 
              these model systems.
