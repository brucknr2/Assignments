Abstract    :
              The instrumentation and software development requested will enable             
              a sophisticated color stimulus presentation system to be coupled               
              with neurophysiological data collection and analysis in a primate              
              vision research laboratory.  The system will be developed by an                
              established group of investigators experienced in primate vision               
              research.  It will allow the group to include an assessment of                 
              color in their on-going studies of the structural and functional               
              substrates of form, movement, and luminance processing in primate              
              visual cortex.  The software and other details of the system will              
              be made freely available and development of the system in                      
              conjunction with actual experiments will ensure "user friendly"                
              operation.  Other vision researchers are expected to find the                  
              system readily applicable to their investigations.
