Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The overall objective is to hold a high level tutorial ("school")              
              that will bring together for a 10 day period the leading                       
              international experts in the field of visual developmental                     
              neurobiology with young faculty, postdoctorals, and graduate                   
              students who are interested in acquiring knowledge and expertise               
              in this field.  The purpose of the school is two-fold.  To                     
              provide a relatively informal forum by which the students can                  
              interact with established researchers, and to provide an                       
              opportunity for exchange of information among the representatives              
              of the leading laboratories.
