Abstract    :
              This award will support Professor Pierre Schmidt of Florida                    
              International University in a research collaboration with                      
              Professor A. Ortiz-Conde of the Universidad Simon Bolivar in                   
              Caracas, Venezuela.  The objective of the collaboration is                     
              the development of a circuit model for thin film silicon-                      
              on-insulator MOSFETs based upon the charge-sheet concept.                      
              The project will include checking the range of validity of                     
              the models, development of a computer aided design model, and                  
              calculation of static current-voltage characteristics.                         
                                                                                             
              The technology involved in this project is of importance to                    
              radiation-tolerant integrated circuits, to novel three-                        
              dimensional integrated circuits, to high-voltage transistors,                  
              and to advanced device and circuits concepts all based on                      
              thin-film silicon-on-insulator MOSFETs.  A considerable part                   
              of the analytical study will be carried out by the Venezuelan                  
              side, while experimental verification and determination of                     
              the range of validity will be done by the U.S. side.
