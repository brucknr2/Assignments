Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will continue his work in                      
              probability theory in the area of empirical processes.                         
              Essential to his quantile-uniform empirical distribution                       
              function approach is the study of the large sample properties of               
              the uniform empirical process and their relationship through the               
              probability integral transformation to those of arbitrary real                 
              valued random variables.  He will consider problems on the                     
              studies of limit results for sums of intermediate extreme values               
              and records, functional laws of the iterated logarithm for                     
              increment processes and a notion of generalized quantiles.                     
                   The principal investigator will continue his work in                      
              probability theory in the area of empirical processes.                         
              Empirical processes theory has largely been concerned with                     
              uniform analogues of the classical limit theorems for sums of                  
              independent random variables, which is the foundations of                      
              mathematical statistics.  The investigator will continue to                    
              develope an approach he developed to study limit theorems for                  
              intermediate extreme values.
