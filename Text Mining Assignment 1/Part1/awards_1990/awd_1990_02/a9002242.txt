Abstract    :
              With this award the principal investigator will continue his                   
              analytical studies of free boundary problems using asymptotic                  
              methods and he will initiate attempts to construct efficient                   
              numerical schemes for the resolution of interfacial phenomena.                 
              Overall he plans to develop a unified theory of free boundary                  
              problems that arise in phase transitions based upon the Phase                  
              Field Model that he himself has helped to popularize.  The                     
              principal investigator will consider progressively realistic                   
              models of alloys and contact with external containers.                         
              Many technologically important natural phenomena involve the                   
              behavior of different media along the interfaces or surfaces of                
              contact between them.  With this award the principal investigator              
              will continue his important work on developing approximate                     
              solutions of models of phase transitions using asymptotic methods              
              and he will begin developing numerical schemes in order to                     
              resolve increasingly complicated interfacial phenomena.  This                  
              combined asymptotic-numerical approach should pay big dividends                
              toward understanding the physics of transition layers and free                 
              boundary problems.
