Abstract    :
              This research addresses the inverse problem in underwater                      
              acoustics and shows how it may be solved for the case of                       
              finite oceans with depth varying index of refraction.                          
              There are two difficulties which must be resolved.  The                        
              first has to do with the interaction of the ocean surface                      
              and bottom.  Preliminary computations and graphics show                        
              that this problem has been taken care of using our version                     
                                                                                             
              of the far-field function array.  For more resolution we                       
              propose using more propagating modes.  The procedure will                      
              require, however, an increased cpu time.  To take into                         
              account the effects of a variable index of refraction, we                      
              make use of transmutation, a procedure which relates                           
              solutions of complicated differential equations to simpler                     
              ones.  We have shown how, using transmutation, we may                          
              compute the "perturbed modes", and the propagating Green's                     
              function.  Initial computations with small wave number                         
              were promising.
