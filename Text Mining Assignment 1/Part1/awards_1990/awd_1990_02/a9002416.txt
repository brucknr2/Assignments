Abstract    :
                   This project will support a postdoc working with the                      
              principal investigator on two important and difficult problems of              
              mathematical physics:  the stability of atomic and molecular                   
              systems and the number of parameters needed to describe a                      
              stationary black hole.  The first problem concerns the number of               
              electrons that can exist in stable atoms and molecules;  the                   
              second problem concerns the correctness of the assumption that                 
              the mass and the angular momentum together describe a stationary               
              black hole.                                                                    
                   Mathematical physicists very often use the same or similar                
              ideas to study very small and very large physical systems.  This               
              proposal will study just how many electrons can exist in a stable              
              atom or molecule (a very small system governed by the laws of                  
              quantum mechanics) and whether the mass and the angular momentum               
              of a stationary black hole determine its structure (a very large               
              system governed by the laws of general relativity).
