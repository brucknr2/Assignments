Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research in number theory of                      
              Professor Hendrik Lenstra of the University of California at                   
              Berkeley. Dr. Lenstra has proposed to continue his research in                 
              several directions. In primality testing and factorization of                  
              large integers, he will study the newest factoring algorithm,                  
              known as the Number Field Sieve, and work on the practical                     
              implementation of a primality test. In algebraic number theory,                
              he will investigate the existence of governing fields and study                
              the class group structure of abelian fields.                                   
                   Except for counting, number theory, which is the study of                 
              the properties of the whole numbers, is the oldest branch of                   
              mathematics. In modern days, problems in number theory have                    
              furnished the driving force to creation of new mathematics in the              
              fields of pure algebra, analysis, and geometry; some of the most               
              recent and most astonishing applications of number theory have                 
              appeared in theoretical computer science and coding theory.
