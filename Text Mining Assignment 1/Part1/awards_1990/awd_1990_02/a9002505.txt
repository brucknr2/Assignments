Abstract    :
                   A symposium entitled "From Symmetries to Strings:  Forty                  
              Years of Rochester Conferences" will be held May 4-5, 1990 at                  
              the University of Rochester.  The purpose of this symposium is                 
              to review theoretical and experimental developments in                         
              elementary particle physics, and to assess where we stand in                   
              this field.  The speakers will be experts from numerous areas                  
              of theoretical and experimental research.                                      
                   At the present moment, there exist many theoretical                       
              conjectures concerning possible physics beyond what has already                
              been seen in the laboratory.  New machines are just starting to                
              produce data which may test some of these ideas.  A symposium                  
              to assess where we stand will serve the very useful function of                
              focussing our thinking as the new data begins to be available.
