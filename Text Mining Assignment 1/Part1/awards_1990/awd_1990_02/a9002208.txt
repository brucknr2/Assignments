Abstract    :
              Description:  This project provides funds to the Asian                         
              Cultural Council (ACC) to support research of scholars                         
              selected under the Indo-U.S. Subcommission on Education and                    
              Culture.  Eight awardees will come from a wide range of                        
              scientific fields in the social and physical sciences, and                     
              will work with counterparts in India.  Funds from this grant                   
              are used for travel expenses and costs related to the                          
              scholars' research projects, and to pay for stipends for                       
              awardees.  The ACC scientific committees select nominees for                   
              submission to NSF, which makes the final technical evaluation                  
              of awardees.  Past awardees have been engaged primarily in                     
              social and behavioral sciences, with some in the geological                    
              and few in physical sciences.  The funds provided include                      
              U.S. $15,000 to cover part of the ACC administrative work                      
              costs.                                                                         
                                                                                             
              Scope:  Collaboration between U.S. and Indian scientists is                    
              clearly demonstrated in this project.  The ACC representative                  
              office in India obtains the necessary clearances for the U.S.                  
              scientists to be affiliated with various Indian academic and                   
              research institutions.  They also manage the logistics                         
              associated with the travel of the scientists, and his/her                      
              family when appropriate, shipping of research material into                    
              and out of India, as well as language training, and assisting                  
              with research arrangements.  Past performance under similar                    
              awards was judged by NSF staff and the U.S. scientific                         
              community as being excellent.
