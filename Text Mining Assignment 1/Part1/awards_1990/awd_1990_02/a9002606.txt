Abstract    :
                   This project is concerned with the representation theory of               
              general linear groups and their quantizations. The principal                   
              investigator will investigate the Hecke algebras associated with               
              Weyl groups in an effort to extend the work on q-Schur algebras                
              and apply it to other groups of Lie type.                                      
                   This research is in the general area of the representation                
              theory of finite classical groups. One of the main applications                
              of group theory to other mathematical and scientific fields is in              
              representation theory, and finite classical groups are a primary               
              source of finite simple groups.
