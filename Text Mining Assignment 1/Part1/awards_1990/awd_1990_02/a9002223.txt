Abstract    :
              This project supports the participation of Dr. Geoffrey Kamau of the           
              University of Nairobi in an ongoing, long-term project to develop new          
              electrocatalytic approaches for destruction of halogenated organic             
              pollutants in aqueous surfactant media.  Specific aims for the two-year        
              period of this collaborative component center around optimizing                
              experimental design factors to attain significantly faster                     
              dehalogenation rates.  The broad, long-term goals of the research              
              project are to make possible new strategies for permanently effective          
              detoxification of contaminated materials such as sediments, soils, and         
              industrial oils, and to provide new insights into toxic and                    
              environmental interactions of organohalides by establishing fundamental        
              kinetic and thermodynamic characteristics of their electron-transfer           
              reactions.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              Environmental contamination with organohalide chemicals is a worldwide         
              problem.  Dehalogenation methods being developed should be directly            
              applicable to other pollutants as well.  The project is consistent with        
              the criteria for the Science in Developing Countries (SDC) program in          
              that it strengthens collaboration between U.S. scientists and engineers        
              and their counterparts in developing countries, and increases the              
              capacity of scientists and engineers in developing countries to address        
              constraints to development.
