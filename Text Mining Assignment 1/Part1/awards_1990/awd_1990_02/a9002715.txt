Abstract    :
                   This research is concerned with algebraic K-theory. The                   
              principal investigator will study the special lambda-ring                      
              identities for the general exterior power operations. In                       
              addition he will study the connection between the algebraic                    
              K-groups and the motivic cohomology groups and work on higher                  
              periods of symmetric powers of elliptic curves.                                
                   This project is in the general area of algebraic K-theory.                
              K-theory concerns the evolution of the ideas of vector space,                  
              basis, linear mapping and general linear group to a context                    
              where the scalars are from a commutative or noncommutative                     
              ring. In this context, K-theory can be utilized in algebraic                   
              geometry and other mathematical models involving coefficients                  
              from rings.
