Abstract    :
                   This project will concentrate on the role of reaction-                    
              diffusion equations in mathematical ecology.  Population dynamics              
              for communities in heterogeneous environments will be considered.              
              It is expected that substantial progress will be made by                       
              employing mathematical tools such as the concepts of persistence               
              and  permanence in dynamical systems.  The notion of skew-product              
              flow will be applied to study species and community models which               
              involve temporal and spatial heterogeneity.  It is also planned                
              to investigate the relation between reaction-diffusion models and              
              the theory of island biogeography.
