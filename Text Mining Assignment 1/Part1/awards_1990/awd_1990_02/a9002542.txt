Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary purpose of this U.S.-Czechoslavak workshop is to                   
              bring leading polymer researchers together from both countries                 
              to examine fundamental topics pertaining to biomaterials.                      
              Specifically, discussions will feature several important                       
              polymer systems and include topics relating to synthetic                       
              methods, structural and morphological analysis (surface and                    
              bulk), and property measurement methods and results.  The                      
              intended multidisciplinary interaction should stimulate                        
              follow-on basic research projects on polymeric materials with                  
              long-term potential for use in areas such as hydrogels and                     
              biodegradable polymers.                                                        
                                                                                             
              This cooperative workshop in polymers research fulfills the                    
              program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by                         
              enabling leading experts in the United States and Eastern                      
              Europe to combine complementary talents and pool research                      
              resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
