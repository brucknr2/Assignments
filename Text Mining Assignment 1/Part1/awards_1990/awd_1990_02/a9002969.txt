Abstract    :
                   Professor Yan will continue his research into multivariable               
              spectral theory through the approach of Hilbert modules.  The                  
              goal is to apply methods from algebraic geometry, homological                  
              algebra, and complex geometry.  He will study topological and                  
              algebraic invariants of Hilbert modules, the structures of C*-                 
              algebras associated with natural Hilbert modules and the spectral              
              theory of subnormal modules.                                                   
                   Professor Yan's work involves the theory of C* algebras.                  
              The notion of a C* algebra is an abstraction of the idea of a                  
              family of linear transformations on a space.  These                            
              transformations can also be thought of as having values in the                 
              states of the space, and the property of this family which is                  
              responsible for the symbol * is that the algebra is generated by               
              transformations whose values in these states are real numbers.                 
              The fact that these objects appear naturally in many branches of               
              mathematics and physics make them important to study.
