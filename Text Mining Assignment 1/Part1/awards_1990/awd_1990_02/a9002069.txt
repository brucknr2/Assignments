Abstract    :
                   The study of 3-manifolds could be described to the lay                    
              person as the study of all possible 3-dimensional universes                    
              which are locally "like" the space we live in.  This project will              
              continue research into a class of 3-manifolds called laminated                 
              manifolds.  It has the potential to influence the subject quite                
              significantly, especially if two goals are achieved.  The first                
              goal is to extend methods and theorems from the well-known class               
              of Haken manifolds to the larger class of laminated manifolds.                 
              The second goal is to show that, in some sense, "most" 3-                      
              manifolds are laminated.                                                       
                   Another part of the project deals with surfaces or 2-                     
              manifolds.  Here the object is to study certain geometric                      
              structures on surfaces, the spaces of these structures                         
              (Teichmueller spaces), laminations to which the geometric                      
              structures degenerate, and spaces of these laminations.  The                   
              remainder of the project deals with codimension-1 laminations in               
              manifolds of arbitrary dimension, especially with those having                 
              transverse structures.
