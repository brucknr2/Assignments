Abstract    :
                   The central Sierra Nevada batholith, an Andean-type magmatic              
              arc, was emplaced in an overriding continental plate during the                
              Cretaceous.  Modern Andean studies imply the plate should be                   
              under compressional stress produced by subduction, however in the              
              batholith only magmatic foliation is present and there is a                    
              virtual absence of regionally developed solid-state foliation.                 
              Given the compressional field thought to be active, these                      
              observations raise questions concerning the dynamic field                      
              attending emplacement of the batholith.  This project will                     
              examine the geometry, kinematics and strain features of ductile                
              shear zones in the batholith and wall rocks to establish their                 
              role in the dynamic and deformational history of batholith                     
              emplacement.  Results are expected to shed light on upper crustal              
              stress fields accompanying plutonism and in the fabrics developed              
              in collisional tectonic environments.
