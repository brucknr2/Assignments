Abstract    :
                   This project is a study of several fundamental issues arising             
              in the problem of multiuser optical communications.  Two general               
              topics are being addressed:  (1) the stochastic modelling of the               
              spectral behavior of semiconductor lasers and a corresponding                  
              assesment of the fundamental effects of phase instabilities on                 
              multiuser optical systems; and  (2) the optimum demodulation of                
              multiple access optical signals within both continuous and quantum             
              observation models.
