Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research in Ramsey theory and graph               
              theory of Professor Igor Kriz of the University of Chicago. Dr.                
              Kriz has proposed to study major questions of well-partial-                    
              ordering theory in connection with Ramsey theory. Specifically,                
              he will attempt to generalize the Robertson-Seymour graph-minor                
              theorem to the case of infinite graphs, and will continue his                  
              investigations of ordinal invariants in well-partial-ordering                  
              theory and Ramsey theory.                                                      
                   This research falls in the broad category of combinatorics,               
              which is one of the most active fields in today's mathematics.                 
              Fundamentally, combinatorics represents a systematization of the               
              very first of all mathematical activities, counting. In its                    
              modern development, however, combinatorics has gone beyond just                
              counting to make use of a wide variety of advanced mathematical                
              techniques, and although its roots go back several centuries, the              
              field has had an explosive development in the past few decades                 
              because of its importance in communications and information                    
              technology.
