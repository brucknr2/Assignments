Abstract    :
              This award will support Professor C. Denise Caldwell of the                    
              University of Central Florida in a research collaboration with                 
              Professor J. Jimenez-Mier of the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de              
              Mexico (UNAM).  The investigators intend to measure the alignment              
              of photoions as determined through the angular distribution of                 
              decay fluorescence.  The experiments will be performed at the                  
              University of Wisconsin Synchrotron Radiation Center with an                   
              apparatus that has been specifically constructed for performing                
              this type of experiment.  The experimental effort will be joined               
              by the investigator from Mexico, who will be responsible for all               
              data analysis and analytic interpretation.                                     
                                                                                             
              Measurement of alignment of photoions by fluorescence analysis is              
              a relative newcomer to the group of techniques that are available              
              for study of electron-electron correlation.  Due to its sensitivity            
              to effects of this interaction, it has the potential of becoming a             
              powerful tool, especially for analysis at thresholds.  In addition             
              to the application of this technique to the study of various                   
              systems, the investigators will try to interpret its measurements              
              in terms of existing theories.
