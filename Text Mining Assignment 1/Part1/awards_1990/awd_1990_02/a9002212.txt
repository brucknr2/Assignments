Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a SGER project to collect and to study                                 
              the perishable earthquake and structural                                       
              response/damage data due to the                                                
              October 17, 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake.                                       
                                                                                             
              Perishable site soil data by in-situ                                           
              borehole/geophone experiments and dynamic                                      
              property data of reinforced concrete members                                   
              by laboratory tests of field samples will be                                   
              collected, and evaluated.  Soil damping, shear                                 
              modules, and nonlinear soil stress-strain                                      
              relationship will be determined.  Using the                                    
              basic data of soil and concrete, a dynamic                                     
              analysis of the double deck bridge structures                                  
              will be carried out.                                                           
                                                                                             
              The California Department of Transportation                                    
              will provide design blue prints and soil log                                   
              charts of the bridge-sites to assist the                                       
              study.                                                                         
                                                                                             
              The effort will lead to better understanding                                   
              the effect of local soil to the structural                                     
              response and improved understanding of failure                                 
              causes of the bridge structures of the I-880                                   
              viaduct.
