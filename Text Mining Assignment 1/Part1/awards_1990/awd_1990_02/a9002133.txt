Abstract    :
                   Professor Casian will attempt to extend his recent proof of               
              the Kazhdan-Lusztig conjecture for Kac-Moody algebras in the                   
              symmetrizable case in various directions.  One direction will                  
              involve Schubert varieties of finite dimension instead of those                
              of finite codimension or infinite dimension.  Another will                     
              entail trying to remove the symmetrizability assumption.  In                   
              addition Professor Casian's research will focus on weight                      
              filtrations on Harish-Chandra modules.                                         
                   This research involves the theory of group representations.               
              Group theory is basically the theory of symmetry.  To take a                   
              simple example, when the system in question is invariant under a               
              change in the position of the origin of space, the group of                    
              translations naturally arises.  While groups are abstract                      
              objects, particular situations demand concrete realizations or                 
              "representations" of the symmetry group.
