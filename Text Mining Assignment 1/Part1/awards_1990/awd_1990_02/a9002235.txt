Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The NSF will provide the first of an expected five years of                    
              support to the University of Arizona Laboratory of Tree-Ring                   
              Research.  It allows the laboratory to hire a full-time                        
              dendrochronologist to analyze archaeological samples and provides              
              half-time support for a graduate student assistant.                            
                                                                                             
              The technique of tree-ring dating was pioneered at Arizona.                    
              Because the rate of tree growth is determined by environmental                 
              conditions, yearly growth rings in a tree vary in form and                     
              thickness.  It is possible to build up a tree ring chronology by               
              cross matching trees from the present to well back in the                      
              prehistoric past and then to use this "master record" to date                  
              small wood samples collected from archaeological and other                     
              situations.  For archaeologists in the Southwestern United                     
              States, this technique has been a boon because it allows                       
              materials to be dated within one year.  This far exceeds the                   
              accuracy of radiocarbon dating.                                                
                                                                                             
              Because it has not been adequately supported and because many                  
              archaeologists lack the funds to pay for its services, the                     
              Arizona laboratory has not been able on its own to keep pace with              
              archaeological requests for sample dating.  This project will                  
              help to remedy that situation.  In particular, it will benefit                 
              young scientists and those not associated with main line research              
              institutions.
