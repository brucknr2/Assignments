Abstract    :
                   This project will investigate the theory of quantales and                 
              their applications. It will utilize lattice theoretic and                      
              category theoretic methods to explore the general theory of these              
              partially ordered algebraic structures. The principal                          
              investigator will also consider applications to diverse areas                  
              such as ring and monoid theory, C*-algebras, and linear logic and              
              its use in theoretical computer science.                                       
                   The research in this project involves category theory and                 
              its applications to problems in theoretical computer science.                  
              Traditionally, category theory has dealt with the foundations of               
              algebra; namely, it has focused on sets with algebraic structure,              
              mappings between sets that preserve that structure, and even more              
              abstract functors that relate the collections of algebraic                     
              structures and their mappings. In recent years, this research                  
              subject has enjoyed a rebirth in theoretical computer science.
