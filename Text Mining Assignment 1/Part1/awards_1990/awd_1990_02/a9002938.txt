Abstract    :
                   This grant provides partial support for the collaboration                 
              of Prof. Jeffrey R. Vanhoy, U. S. Naval Academy, Prof. Sally F.                
              Hicks, University of Dallas, and the University of Kentucky to                 
              study the collectively excited structure of 140Ce.  Inelastic                  
              neutron scattering will be used to bombard isotopically                        
              enriched Ce targets for this work.  The quadrupole and octopole                
              excitations can be understood from measurements of elastic and                 
              inelastic differential neutron cross sections.  Additionally,                  
              the states of 127Xe will be studied by means of the 127I(p,n)                  
              reaction because of the importance of 127Xe as a neutrino                      
              detector.  An investigation will be undertaken as part of this                 
              grant to understand how neutron polarization is modified as a                  
              neutron beam passes through a thick aligned or polarized                       
              target.  Neutron resonance parameters can be used to clarify                   
              aspects of polarized neutron transport through the targets used                
              at LANL-LANSCE in parity and time-reversal violation                           
              experiments.
