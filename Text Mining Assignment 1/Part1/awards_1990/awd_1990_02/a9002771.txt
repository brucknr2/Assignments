Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Two investigators will continue their studies of global                   
              problems in differential geometry and related areas.  One will                 
              investigate the Gromov-Hausdorff closure of the class of                       
              Riemannian manifolds with curvature bounded from below and                     
              diameter from above.  In this setting, structure problems,                     
              finiteness problems, and uniqueness problems will be investigated              
              in terms of volume and new metric invariants such as excess and                
              triameter.  The second postdoctoral investigator will study the                
              relationship between geometry and topology of certain classes of               
              manifolds.  Finiteness, Riemannian fibrations, injectivity                     
              radius, and rigidity will be among the aspects of these spaces to              
              be investigated.                                                               
                   For many years geometers have worked to understand the                    
              relationship between the curvature of generalized surfaces and                 
              their shape.  These investigators have proven that such surfaces               
              which have curvature bounded below and diameter bounded above,                 
              must have certain specified shapes.  In this project they will                 
              expand this investigation to include surfaces with other                       
              desireable properties.
