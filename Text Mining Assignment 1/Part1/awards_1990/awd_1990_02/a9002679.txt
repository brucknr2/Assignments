Abstract    :
              With this award the principal investigator will study models of                
              nonlinear elasticity that describe the behavior of elastic                     
              materials at moderate to large deformations.  In contrast to                   
              linear models nonlinear models usually require for their solution              
              more sophisticated types of mathematical analysis.  On the                     
              theoretical side the principal investigator will study the weak                
              continuity of the Jacobian determinant and the choice of a space               
              of admissible deformations.  On the applied side he will study                 
              the stability of elastic composite materials such as foam rubber,              
              and he will analyze solid-solid phase transitions in elastic                   
              crystals.                                                                      
              A goodly number of everyday phenomena involving elastic materials              
              can be explained using what is called linear elasticity theory.                
              This linear theory concerns the behavior of elastic materials in               
              response to small deformations.  However when the deformations                 
              are moderate to large in size the linear theory must be replaced               
              with a more complicated nonlinear theory.  A nonlinear theory is               
              also required if the material is a composite, such as foam rubber              
              or fibre-reinforced rubber.  With this award the principal                     
              investigator will use mathematical analysis to study models of                 
              nonlinear elastic materials.
