Abstract    :
                   This project will study dynamical systems with infinitely                 
              many degrees of freedom which arise in mathematical physics                    
              through techniques such as the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser theory,                 
              invariant manifold theorems, and Liapunov exponents.  First, the               
              project will focus on the relationship between techniques like                 
              the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser theory, and the accelerated                        
              convergence methods developed to study localized states in                     
              Schrodinger operators with  random or quasi-periodic potentials,               
              and will attempt to exploit these relationships to prove the                   
              existence of periodic orbits in partial differential equations.                
              Second, it will investigate how ideas like center manifold                     
              theorem can be combined with a  Hamiltonian structure to study                 
              partial differential equations like the Boussinesq equation and                
              other equations related to hydrodynamics.  Finally, it will study              
              the existence of quantities like the Liapunov exponents for                    
              infinite dimensional dynamical systems arising in statistical                  
              mechanics.  A better understanding of such quantities would give               
              one a dynamical analogue of the thermodynamic limit in                         
              equilibrium statistical mechanics.
