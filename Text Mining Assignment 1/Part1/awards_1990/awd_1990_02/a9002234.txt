Abstract    :
              Professor Albrecht is supported by the Experimental Physical                   
              Chemistry Program to develop and characterize novel nonlinear                  
              optical techniques and to apply these techniques to the study                  
              of ultrafast dynamical processes in a variety of molecular                     
              liquids.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              Two complementary four-wave mixing techniques are used.  One                   
              new approach uses nanosecond light pulses having a very short                  
              correlation time.  Both precise frequency (even sub-Raman                      
              linewidth) and time measurements are possible, though on an                    
              "accumulated" basis.  There is promise that inhomogeneous                      
              broadening can be separated from the homogeneous.  The second                  
              four-wave mixing technique uses femtosecond multicolor pulses                  
              to measure time-resolved dynamics on the same systems.                         
              Processes that affect electronic, vibronic, and vibrational                    
              dephasing are examined either in molecular liquids and their                   
              mixtures or in solutions of dye aggregates.
