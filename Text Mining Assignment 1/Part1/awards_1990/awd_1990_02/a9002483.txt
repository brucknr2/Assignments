Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal is to conduct a hydrographic cruise in the                       
              Pacific along longitudes 88 and 150 degrees west.  As a central                
              element of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE), the                  
              crusie will provide measurements of temperature, salinity,                     
              nutrients, and many additional chemical tracers useful to                      
              describe the ocean ciruclation.  This propsoal is to provide the               
              technical sampling and analysis for the entire program.
