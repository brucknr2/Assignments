Abstract    :
              This research will develop a flexible knowledge representation                 
              medium and sufficient natural language processing tools to allow               
              the automated extension of an expert system's knowledge base                   
              through access to machine-readable natural language texts such as              
              dictionaries, thesauri, and technical references.  The work on an              
              early prototype has used the Merck manual as a source ?Merck                   
              1977!.  Initial work will include the building of a parsing                    
              system consisting of a core grammar and the means to expand the                
              core grammar semi-automatically. Using this parsing system, the                
              effort will develop the incremental augmentation of the knowledge              
              system directly from the analysis of the text.  The ability of an              
              expert system to extend its own knowledge base by extracting                   
              information from machine readable text is valuable for a wide                  
              variety of systems, including expert systems for large technical               
              applications in a domain in which the information is continually               
              being updated.  Other projects rely on human intervention during               
              the process that extracts new knowledge ?Lenat et al. 1986;                    
              Humphrey 1989; Antonacci et al. 1989!.  This makes dealing with                
              problems such as contradictory information much easier.  In                    
              contrast, here the feasibility of automating the actual                        
              extraction of information, in a disciplined way, from a                        
              structured technical reference will be examined.
