              This research program is part of the                                           
              initiative to collect perishable data                                          
              resulting from the 17 October 1989 Northern                                    
              California (Loma Prieta) earthquake.                                           
                                                                                             
              This is a collaborative project with                                           
              Professor G. Wayne Clough at Virginia

              The Earth Technology Corporation, Long Beach,                                  
              California, is assisting in obtaining the                                      
              field data: in addition Drs. Geoffrey Martin                                   
              and Edward Kavazanjian of Earth Technology                                     
              Corporation are providing technical                                            
              assistance to the project.  Drs. Clough,                                       
              Chameau, and Kavazanjian during the period                                     
              1979-1985 investigated the soil response and                                   
              soil failures expected in the Bay Area as a                                    
              result of a large earthquake: however the                                      
              effects observed as a result of the Loma                                       
              Prieta earthquake appear to be more extensive                                  
              than was expected, in part because the ground                                  
              motions were more severe than anticipated                                      
              from data existing ten years ago.  The                                         
              project is utilizing these previous studies,                                   
              focusing on the areas that suffered                                            
              significant ground failures, such as the                                       
              Marina District.  At the same time it is                                       
              using the improved understanding of ground                                     
              failure mechanisms that has occurred since                                     
              the original studies were undertaken.                                          
                                                                                             
              The objectives of this project are: to gather                                  
              relevant geotechnical data obtained since                                      
              1980; to map ground features that are                                          
              important to identify the extent of                                            
              liquefaction and ground amplification                                          
              effects; perform about 30 cone penetration                                     
              tests at locations where earlier tests had                                     
              been conducted; organize the above                                             
              information into a computerized data base;                                     
              and make preliminary assessments of the                                        
              correlation between field observations and                                     
              data obtained before and after the 1989                                        
              earthquake.
