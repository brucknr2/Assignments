Abstract    :
              This proposal is aimed at providing a comprehensive experimental               
              study of condensed phase dynamical processes using femtosecond to              
              microsecond time resolved spectroscopic techniques.  Phase                     
              transitions and intermolecular or interionic vibrational motions               
              will be studied in liquids at various temperatures and pressures               
              to elucidate the nature of liquid state molecular motion, the                  
              extent of inhomogeneity in simple liquids, and the persistence of              
              local liquid structure.
