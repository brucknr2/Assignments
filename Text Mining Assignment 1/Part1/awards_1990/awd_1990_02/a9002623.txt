Abstract    :
              Dr. Omar M. Yaghi has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research                     
              Fellowship in Chemistry.  Dr. Yaghi's doctoral degree was from                 
              the University of Illinois under the supervision of Professor                  
              Walter G. Klemperer.  Dr. Yaghi intends to continue research at                
              Harvard University under the sponsorship of Profesor Richard                   
              Holm.  Dr. Yaghi's area of postdoctoral research and training                  
              will be structure and reactivity of metal sulfide clusters.                    
              Longer term, he plans to extend his studies to metal sulfur,                   
              chalcogenide, oxide and nitride superclusters and                              
              organic/inorganic composites.                                                  
                                                                                             
              The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as                 
              an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the                   
              knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.s and attract them into                   
              meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and                       
              teaching.
