Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Three investigators will study problems in Kaehler geometry,              
              calibrations, spinors, and Teichmuller theory.  These involve                  
              Chern currents, slicing, spin structures, harmonic maps between                
              Teichmuller spaces, the Thurston boundary of Teichmuller space,                
              and moduli spaces of compact Riemannian surfaces.                              
                   Differential geometry is the study of the structure and                   
              shape of generalized surfaces.  These investigators will                       
              concentrate their efforts on surfaces based on the complex                     
              numbers rather than the real numbers.  A Teichmuller space is the              
              reduction of one of these complex generalized surfaces to a                    
              system of lower dimensional objects which are easier to                        
              understand.  These investigators will continue their studies of                
              such spaces in an effort to apply these new theories to questions              
              arising from particle physics.
