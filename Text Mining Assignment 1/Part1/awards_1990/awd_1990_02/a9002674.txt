Abstract    :
                   This project will support a conference entitled Summer                    
              Conference on General Topology and Applications.  It will be held              
              June 14-16 at the C.W. Post Campus of Long Island University.                  
              The goals of the conference are (1) to facilitate communication                
              and collaboration among topologists from a wide geographic area,               
              (2) to improve communication between topologists and                           
              mathematicians in related fields, (3) to bring to the                          
              participants the leading researchers and latest developments in                
              the field, and (4) to expose advanced graduate students to the                 
              excitement and intense research activity of this conference.  The              
              principal speakers are A.V. Arhangel'skii, B. Banaschewski, W.W.               
              Comfort, Gruenhage, B. Mandelbrot, and S. Watson.  The                         
              proceedings of the conference will be published by Marcel Dekker.
