Abstract    :
                   Haught will continue her investigation of the degree                      
              structures induced by strengthenings of Turing computability.                  
              These strengthenings are obtained by placing size restrictions on              
              various aspects of a Turing calculation.  In particular, she is                
              interested in truth table reducibility, weak truth table                       
              reducibility, and polynomial-time bounded Turing reducibility.                 
              She plans to develop technical methods for solving structural                  
              questions about the degrees, and to analyze the degree structures              
              in terms of the proof techniques which are appropriate to the                  
              structures.  In this way she hopes to uncover heretofore hidden                
              connections among the various degree structures.                               
                   Other aspects of the project are a continuation of Haught's               
              study of the interactions between model theory and recursion                   
              theory in the setting of reverse mathematics, and an                           
              investigation of the properties of introreducible sets, but the                
              major effort will be invested in understanding what it means for               
              a proposition to be unprovable, making use of the various                      
              idealizations of computability cited above.
