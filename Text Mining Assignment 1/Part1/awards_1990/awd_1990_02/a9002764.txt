Abstract    :
                   This award will provide support to a group from Johns                     
              Hopkins University, who is participating in an experiment in                   
              high energy physics with the L3 detector at LEP, CERN                          
              Switzerland, the new 27 kilometer electron positron collider.                  
              The aim of the experiment is the study of the properties of the                
              Zo particle, the neutral carrier of the weak nuclear force,                    
              involving the decay of Zo into hadrons, and a precise                          
              determination of the number of neutrino species. It will also                  
              search for new particles.  The primary focus of the L3 detector                
              is its ability to achieve mass measurements to better than 1%                  
              for the leptons.  An important part of the muon detection                      
              system is the Time Expansion Chamber (TEC) a device with strict                
              resolution requirements.  The Johns Hopkins group is                           
              responsible of the readout and software of the calibration                     
              system of TEC, which is to provide 0.1% calibration for the                    
              drift velocity during normal data taking runs, an essential                    
              feature for some of the physics to be achieved by the L3                       
              detector.
