Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will investigate the theory of                 
              modular representation of finite groups of Lie type for primes                 
              not equal to the characteristic. She will also work on two                     
              specific problems on Green functions and the related                           
              Hall-Littlewood functions: a group-theoretic interpretation of                 
              some symmetric functions in two variables introduced by                        
              Macdonald, and a Murnaghan-Nakayama type formula for Green                     
              functions of classical groups.                                                 
                   This research is in the general area of the representation                
              theory of finite groups of Lie type. One of the main                           
              applications of group theory to other mathematical and                         
              scientific fields is in representation theory.
