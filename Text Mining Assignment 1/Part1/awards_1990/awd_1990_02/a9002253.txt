Abstract    :
              This project will continue research on the semantics of computation.           
              The emphasis during the coming period will be on methods for proving           
              the correctness of compilers.  The use of higher-order assembly                
              language rather than combinators as a model of a compiler's target             
              code allows great flexibility in the architecture of the compiler's            
              abstract machine; this flexibility will be used to prove the                   
              correctness of a variety of different environment and code                     
              representations.  A second thread is a continuation of work on strong          
              typing for object-oriented systems; here a variety of issues                   
              concerning subtyping and coercion will be studied.
