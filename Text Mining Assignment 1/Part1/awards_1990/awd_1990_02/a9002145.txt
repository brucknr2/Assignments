Abstract    :
              Ecological research is often enhanced by access to sophisticated               
              instrumentation for chemical analysis, but it is usually not                   
              cost-effective to have every instrument in every ecologist's lab.              
              This proposal requests funds for the acquisition of shared-use                 
              instrumentation that will permit a group of five ecologists at                 
              Fordham University's Calder Conservation and Ecology Center, with              
              diverse research interests, to enhance their chemical analytical               
              capabilities.  The instruments include a Technicon TrAAcs-800                  
              element analyzer, a Hewlett Packard HP5890A Capillary Gas                      
              chromatograph, a Waters High Performance Liquid Chromatography                 
              System, and  a Perkin-Elmer HGA Graphite Furnace for an existing               
              Perking-Elmer 1100B atomic absorption spectrophotometer.  These                
              instruments will be used in the analysis of essential inorganic                
              nutrients in water, sediment and plant tissue samples, complex                 
              organic compounds such as plant pigments and allelochemicals, and              
              trace elements and metals such as aluminum and selenium.  The                  
              research disciplines to which these enhanced analytical                        
              capabilities will be applied include behavioral ecology (foraging              
              choices of large primates based on nutritional quality),                       
              community ecology (species responses to nutrients, metal and                   
              biotic changes) and ecosystems ecology (biogeochemical cycles,                 
              paleoecology, climate change).
