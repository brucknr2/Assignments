Abstract    :
                   This project is concerned with various aspects of artinian                
              rings, in particular homological properties of finite dimensional              
              algebras and decomposition properties of modules.  In the first                
              category, the goal is to obtain a better understanding of global               
              and finitistic dimensions.  Under the second, the aim is to                    
              obtain a representation theory for rings all of whose left                     
              modules are direct sums of finitely generated components.                      
                   The research is in the general area of ring theory.  A                    
              ring is an algebraic structure having both an addition and a                   
              multiplication defined on it.  These objects arise naturally and               
              are important in many areas of mathematics and physics.
