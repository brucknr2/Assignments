Abstract    :
              This award will provide supplementary support to enable Dr. Marc               
              Lamphier of Harvard University to conduct collaborative research               
              for 21 months with Dr. Tadatsugu Taniguchi of the Institute of                 
              Molecular and Cellular Biology, Osaka University, Japan.  They                 
              will study the genetic regulations of the beta-interferon response.            
                                                                                             
              Interferons are cytokines which induce the expression of a number              
              of genes involved in the defense against viral and bacterial                   
              infections, inhibitions of tumor growth, modulation of the immune              
              response, and possibly in the regulation of normal growth and                  
              development.  The human beta-interferon gene was cloned by                     
              Dr. Taniguchi in 1979, and initially overexpressed in E. coli in               
              a collaboration between Taniguchi and the lab at Harvard with which            
              Lamphier is now affiliated.  Two mammalian DNA-binding proteins                
              (IRF-1 and IRF-2) which recognize a common regulatory element in               
              the human beta-interferon promotor have recently been identified               
              and cloned.  The present effort will investigate the mechanism by              
              which these two factors coordinate gene regulation, and use the                
              factors to try to identify part of the network of genes which                  
              moderate the cellular response to beta-interferon.
