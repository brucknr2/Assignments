Abstract    :
                   Work on this project will focus on problems arising in the                
              theory of orthogonal polynomials.  These are polynomials in one                
              complex variable which are orthogonal with respect to some                     
              density (measure) defined on the complex plane.  Particular                    
              emphasis will be placed on those measures which are supported on               
              bounded sets.  The setting is more general than the study of                   
              polynomials defined on a circle.  It is motivated by studies of                
              the Schrodinger equation and dynamical problems which have led to              
              polynomials orthogonal on Julia sets and on spectral questions                 
              concerning Jacobi matrices with unbounded or periodic entries                  
              which are orthogonal on several intervals.  The latter questions               
              emerging from statistical physics.                                             
                   Two primary goals in the work involve the location of the                 
              roots of orthogonal polynomials and analyzing certain asymptotic               
              relationships involving successive roots of polynomials as their               
              degrees increase.  The method to be employed involves a potential              
              theoretic approach by which asymptotics are measured by the                    
              Green's function for the support set.                                          
                   Other work will involve Pade approximation and weighted                   
              polynomial approximation in Lebesgue spaces defined on plane                   
              regions.
