Abstract    :
              In the work supported by this award the principal investigator                 
              will extend some of his work on the infinite-line Kaup-Newell                  
              perturbation theory for a single soliton solution of a nonlinear               
              Schroedinger system to the multiple soliton case.  This work has               
              applications to the transmission of data in the form of wave                   
              packets through nonlinear optical fibers, and so such it is                    
              highly relevant to the design of modern communications' systems                
              that utilize optical fiber technology.  The principal                          
              investigator will employ methods based upon asymptotics in order               
              to study the behavior of solutions of nonlinear systems of                     
              partial differential equations.                                                
              Every day, it seems, there are articles in the newspapers about                
              the use of fiber optics technologies in the design of modern                   
              communications systems.  Indeed, telephone companies and                       
              computer companies are very much interested in designing                       
              "lossless" ways of transmitting data.  One possible solution is                
              the emerging technologies based upon fiber optics, since fiber                 
              optics  affords the potential of transmitting data without                     
              significant dispersion or distortion.  With this award the                     
              principal investigator will study solutions of the nonlinear                   
              system of equations that describes the propagation of waves                    
              through optical fibers.
