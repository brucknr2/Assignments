Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The principal investigator will develop a Morse theory of                 
              minimal two-spheres analogous to that of closed geodesics.  A                  
              goal of the project is to construct large numbers of minimal two-              
              spheres of low area using a result of the investigator concerning              
              Morse theory at low energies.  The investigator will also exploit              
              the relationship between minimal two-spheres in Riemannian                     
              manifolds and holomorphic vector bundles over the Riemann sphere.              
              And an extension of Hilbert's theorem to n-dimensional                         
              submanifolds of constant negative curvature in odd-dimensional                 
              Euclidean space will also be investigated.                                     
                   This goal of this project is to understand minimal surfaces               
              with low area.  Soap bubbles are examples of minimal surfaces                  
              which minimize energy.  The principal investigator will use Morse              
              theory to study these surfaces and their generalizations to                    
              higher dimensions.  This theory is an extension or our concept of              
              elevation, where basins and mountain passes undergo separate                   
              mathematical interpretations.
