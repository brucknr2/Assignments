Abstract    :
                   This project is concerned with research in ring theory.                   
              The principal investigator will continue investigating the                     
              structure of differential operator rings, Noetherian rings, von                
              Neumann regular rings, and related rings.                                      
                   A ring is an algebraic object having an addition and a                    
              multiplication defined on it. Rings occur in a variety of                      
              settings in mathematics and physics. The specific research                     
              involves the structure and theory of von Neumann regular rings                 
              and rings of differential operators.
