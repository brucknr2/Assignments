Abstract    :
                   This research seeks to better comprehend Just-In-Time in                  
              order to broaden its usage to a wider variety of manufacturing                 
              environments.  The topics to be examined include: (1) analyzing                
              multi-model production in a stochastic environment, (2) extending              
              Just-In-Time to environments with greater variability, and (3)                 
              investigating the impact of set up reduction on inventory, quality             
              and capacity.
