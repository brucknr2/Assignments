Abstract    :
              This research is on IC circuit and system design frameworks,                   
              focusing on process and project management.  Tasks include: (1)                
              developing a model of design development, tasks, and history                   
              appropriate for the CAD framework; (2) creating a prototype                    
              implementation of a task manager to enforce the proper sequencing              
              of design activities and sharing of work among project members,                
              which will be integrated into the OCT framework; and (3) exploring             
              the use of process specification and history to provide effective              
              feedback to project managers.
