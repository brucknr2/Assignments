Abstract    :
                   The existence and classification of finite groups of                      
              symmetries of manifolds of dimensions three and four will be                   
              studied.  Recently there has been a tremendous growth in our                   
              understanding of low-dimensional manifolds, based on techniques                
              pioneered by W. Thurston, M. Freedman, and S. Donaldson.  These                
              new techniques and results have provided the tools to investigate              
              much more systematically the symmetries of these manifolds and                 
              to sharpen significantly the questions that one can hope to                    
              address.                                                                       
                   Existence of symmetries of 4-manifolds:  Freedman showed how              
              to classify all simply connected, closed topological 4-manifolds               
              in terms of their intersection forms and stable triangulation                  
              obstructions.  It is then appropriate to ask what symmetries                   
              these manifolds admit.  Results of the Principal Investigator                  
              show that all these 4-manifolds admit locally linear Zn actions                
              for all odd n and that all except possibly the fake complex                    
              projective plane admit Z  actions that are not necessarily                     
              locally linear.                                                                
                   All the actions above were constructed so as to be                        
              homologically trivial, inducing the identity on homology.  One is              
              led to ask:  What automorphisms of the intersection form of a                  
              closed simply connected topological 4-manifold can be realized                 
              by a periodic homeomorphism of the manifold?
