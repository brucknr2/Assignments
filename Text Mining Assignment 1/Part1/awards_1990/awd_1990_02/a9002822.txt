Abstract    :
              Nuprl is a system supporting the interactive development of formal             
              mathematics.  It was designed to be especially suited to                       
              computationally significant mathematics and to the construction of             
              formally verified software.  The implementation of Nuprl, funded by            
              the NSF, was completed in 1984.  Since then the system has been used           
              extensively at Cornell and elsewhere as a basis for further research.          
              This research has resulted in significant advances in the areas of             
              automated reasoning and computational logic.  The system has been              
              successfully applied to a wide range of problems, from verification of         
              computer hardware to an open problem in the theory of programming              
              languages.  It has been the subject of many articles and PhD theses.           
              The goal of the present project is to rewrite parts of the system in           
              order to incorporate certain extensions (a reflection mechanism) and           
              improvements (new definition facility).  These are based on several            
              years of study and experience with the system.  They will make the             
              system more accessible, both to researchers in the area and                    
              to others such as mathematicians and educators.  With the                      
              implementation of the reflection mechanism, Nuprl will be applicable           
              to domains that are currently difficult to treat.
