Abstract    :
                   The Brigham Young Herbarium contains approximately 350,000                
              specimens, primarily from the state of Utah.  The holdings of                  
              this herbarium probably constitute the world's best                            
              representation of the plants of this area.  This collection has                
              been used extensively for preparation of the Intermountain Flora               
              and the Flora of Utah, and this herbarium is the primary resource              
              for our understanding of the transition between the floras of the              
              Rocky Mountains to the east and the Great Basin to the West.                   
              Research on the biogeography of the American West benefits                     
              greatly from this collection.  Dr. Stanley Welsh, Curator of the               
              Herbarium, has been responsible for the collection's steady                    
              growth over the past decades, and he now proposes to install a                 
              new storage system of movable "compatorized" herbarium cases.                  
              This improvement will support many years of continued growth of                
              the collection.                                                                
                   Natural history collections such as the Brigham Young                     
              Herbarium constitute the a valuable resource for understanding                 
              the diversity of life on earth.  They are indispensable to                     
              research in many fields of science, including but not limited to               
              systematic and evolutionary biology, ecology, biogeography, and                
              conservation.  The continued support and improvement of these                  
              collections will provide future generations of investigators with              
              access to critical research resources.
