Abstract    :
                   This award will support a conference entitled The Second                  
              Conference on Computation and Control.  The conference will be                 
              held from 1 August to 8 August, 1990 on the campus of Montana                  
              State University in Bozeman, Montana.  The theme of the                        
              conference is the interaction between numerical analysts and                   
              control theorists.  Not only is there a need to merge                          
              computational methods into the control theory design, but also                 
              there are areas in control theory that have complete analogies in              
              numerical analysis.  Arrangements have been made with Birkhaeuser              
              to publish the proceedings from this conference.
