Abstract    :
              A Focal Plane Array Autocorrelation Spectrometer (FAAS) will be                
              built in order to realize the full potential of a 15 element                   
              array receiver at the Five College Radio Astronomy Observatory                 
              (FCRAO).  This 16,384 channel autocorrelator will utilize                      
              correlator chips developed by the Netherlands Foundation for                   
              Research in Astronomy.  The fundamental clock rate of the                      
              correlator is 40MHz.  The FAAS will provide 1024 spectral                      
              channels, with 20MHz bandwidth, for each of the elements of the                
              array receiver.  The FAAS spectrometer can time multiplex the                  
              input signal to achieve 200km/sec of bandwidth and approximately               
              1km/sec resolution for the CO J=1-0 transition.  The FAAS is                   
              designed to operate also as a hebrid spectrometer for a single                 
              receiver.  With approximately 15000 channels per receiver                      
              bandwidth.
