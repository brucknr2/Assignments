Abstract    :
              This award will support collaborative research in electrical                   
              engineering and computer science between two US and French                     
              groups.  The US researchers are:  Drs. Allan Willsky and                       
              Sanjoy Mitter, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Dr.                  
              Bernard Levy, University of California at Davis.  The French                   
              researchers are:  Drs. A. Benveniste, R. Nikoukhah and M.                      
              Basseville, French National Institute for Computer Science                     
              and Automation (INRIA).                                                        
                                                                                             
              The research will focus on five topics:  1)  multi-resolution                  
              statistical signal and image processing, including the                         
              development of novel multi-scale stochastic models for                         
              efficient and highly parallel algorithms 2)  discrete event                    
              systems, including the blending of concepts from computer                      
              science and control in order to develop an effective                           
              methodology for the monitoring and control of complex systems                  
              3)  noncausal system models and efficient parallel algorithms                  
              for optimal estimation 4) distributed parameter systems,                       
              including a complete treatment of infinite dimensional                         
              systems and 5)  system and estimation-theoretic approaches to                  
              computer vision. The project will benefit from the history of                  
              previous and successful collaboration between these two                        
              groups and the extensive and complementary expertise of the                    
              US and French investigators.
