Abstract    :
                      Eastern Illiniois University has several researchers who               
              would benefit from access to supercomputers and access to other                
              researchers connected to the NSFNET.  The campus will be                       
              connected directly to the University of Illinois under the                     
              auspices of the Computing Services Office with a 56,000 bits per               
              second communication link.  The University of Illinois will                    
              provide further Internet access through their connection to the                
              NSFNET Backbone network.  They will also provide the necessary                 
              information services and training.                                             
                      This project will improve research and instruction                     
              effectiveness at Eastern Illinois University by enhancing and                  
              expanding desktop access to all Internet facilities including the              
              supercomputing facilities at the National Center for                           
              Supercomputing Apllications and the Statewide Library Circulation              
              System.
