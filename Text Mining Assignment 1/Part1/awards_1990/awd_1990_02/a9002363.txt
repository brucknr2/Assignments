Abstract    :
              This award supports Professor Richard Perez of the State University            
              of New York at Albany to continue a very productive research                   
              collaboration in atmospheric physics with Professor Pierre Ineichen            
              of the Applied Physics Group of the University of Geneva, Switzer-             
              land.  This international collaboration builds upon and enhances               
              his ongoing and planned domestic research.  Specific objectives for            
              their joint research are the further improvement of solar radiation            
              conversion models and the modelling of sky luminance angular                   
              distribution.  They are also committed to the collaborative acquisi-           
              tion, quality control and analysis of radiation data as a contribu-            
              tion to the International Daylighting Measurement Program of the               
              World Meteorological Organization.                                             
                                                                                             
              This research links and enhances U.S. and Swiss research dealing               
              with the measurement and modelling of sky and ground reflected                 
              solar radiation.  It has produced valid models to convert routine              
              solar radiation measurements into quantities suited to various                 
              daylighting and solar energy applications.  A better understanding             
              of the nature and impact of ground reflected radiation will aid                
              in the structural design of energy efficient buildings.
