Abstract    :
                   This project is concerned with research on extremal forms.                
              The principal investigator will study sums of d-th powers of                   
              linear forms over the fields of real and complex numbers as well               
              as situations when positive semi-definite forms need not be sums               
              of squares of forms.                                                           
                   This research concerns the study of real positive semi-                   
              definite forms. It involves interplay among algebra,                           
              inequalities and geometry.
