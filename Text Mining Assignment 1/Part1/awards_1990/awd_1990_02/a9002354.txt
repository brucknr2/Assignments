Abstract    :
                   The goal of this project is to provide a significant                      
              research experience to undergraduate students in order to                      
              encourage them to pursue graduate careers in science.  Students                
              will be especially recruited from under-represented groups and                 
              institutions in the Midwest.  The focus of the research projects               
              will be parallel processing, and it will include design, analysis              
              and implementation of parallel algorithms as well as suitable                  
              programming languages.                                                         
                   During the summer, students will learn the tools and                      
              background necessary to parallel processing and, with the help of              
              faculty, define a research project.  They will continue research               
              on their selected projects at their home institutions during the               
              academic year.
