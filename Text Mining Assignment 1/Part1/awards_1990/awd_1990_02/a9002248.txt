Abstract    :
              In this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and                             
              Organometallic Chemistry Program the effects of applied                        
              electric fields on the absorption and emission spectra of a                    
              wide range of molecules, and on the rates of electron transfer                 
              reactions, will be examined. The results are expected to deepen                
              our understanding of the factors which govern the rates and                    
              specificity of transfer of electrons within and between                        
              molecules.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              Experimental and theoretical methods which have been developed                 
              for studying the effects of electric fields in photosynthetic                  
              systems will be extended to non-biological systems. These                      
              approaches will be used to measure (1) the degree of charge                    
              separation in metal-to-ligand charge transfer and intervalence                 
              transitions in transition metal complexes, (2) the effects of                  
              applied electric fields on the electronic coupling between the                 
              donor and acceptor, (3) the degree of charge-transfer character                
              in the excited states of donor-acceptor compounds which undergo                
              electron transfer but whose absorption spectra are unaffected                  
              by the presence of the  acceptor, (4) the effects of electric                  
              fields on the rates of electron transfer reactions or competing                
              luminescence, and (5) the magnitude of the internal field                      
              correction for various polymeric matrices.
