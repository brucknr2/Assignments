Abstract    :
              This proposal requests funds to purchase a portable Global                     
              Positioning System (GPS) and Geographic Information System (GIS)               
              workstation.  The portable system would be housed primarily at                 
              the University of South Carolina's Belle W. Baruch Institute for               
              Marine Biology and Coastal Research Field Laboratory, but would                
              be available to Baruch Institute scientists, visiting                          
              investigators, and graduate students for work along the entire                 
              east coast.  A GPS and GIS and the type requested is required to               
              answer many basic questions related to spatial variability of                  
              cophysiological parameters with respect to disturbance, point                  
              and nonpoint source pollutant impacts, and natural habitat                     
              gradients.  This technology would enable the PI's to pursue many               
              new and exciting research directions which have been hindered in               
              the past by necessary reliance on existing technology                          
              (traditional costly and time-consuming surveying methods and two               
              dimensional database management and analytical tools).  In                     
              addition, the purchase of this instrumentation would allow them                
              to address many of the new questions which have resulted from the              
              Long-Term Ecological Research Program field studies in North                   
              Inlet. equipment.  Acquisition of this equipment would greatly                 
              enhance current research and create many new opportunities for                 
              Baruch Institute scientists and also increase the attraction for               
              visiting scientists to conduct research at our facility.
