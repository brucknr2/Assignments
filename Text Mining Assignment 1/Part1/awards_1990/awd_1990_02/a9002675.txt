Abstract    :
              This grant is for partial support of a conference on Variability               
              of Active Galactic Nuclei, hosted by Georgia State University in               
              Atlanta, from May 2 to May 4, 1990.  One of the most rapidly                   
              evolving fields in astrophysics is that of Active Galactic Nu-                 
              clei.  This is a field in which the high level of current re-                  
              search activity makes it very desirable to have a scientific                   
              conference on this topic on an annual basis.  The last such                    
              conference in the United States was held at the University of                  
              California at Santa Cruz in August, 1988.  It is anticipated that              
              approximately 100 scientists actively engaged in research in this              
              field will attend this conference.
