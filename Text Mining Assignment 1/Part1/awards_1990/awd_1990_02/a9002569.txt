Abstract    :
              This award will provide partial support for travel of                          
              selected U.S. participants to the XXIIIrd General Assembly                     
              of the International Union of Radio Science (URSI), to be                      
              held in Prague, Czechoslovakia, from August 28 to September                    
              5, 1990.  Funding will be provided to the National Academy                     
              of Sciences for this program.                                                  
              The triennial General Assembly is the principal mechanism for                  
              URSI activities.  Participation by U.S. delegates in the past                  
              has resulted in cooperative programs with other nations.  In                   
              addition, Assembly activities have been published in the                       
              "Proceedings of the General Assembly"; the "Review of Radio                    
              Science"; the "URSI Information Bulletin"; and trip reports                    
              by participants.                                                               
              As a constituent member of the International Council of                        
              Scientific Unions (ICSU), URSI receives support from NSF for                   
              its U.S. membership dues and for activities costs of its U.S.                  
              National Committee.  The NSF Division of International                         
              Programs coordinates the activities of NSF in fostering                        
              international scientific cooperation.  Under the Scientific                    
              Organizations and Resources Program, U.S. scientists and                       
              engineers are provided with broad access to the benefits of                    
              selected nongovernmental international organizations,                          
              including ICSU.  Support of this travel grant is consonant                     
              with this activity.                                                            
              In consideration of the continued merit of URSI as a way of                    
              providing opportunities for cooperation in a multinational                     
              and multidisciplinary context, and of the highly satisfactory                  
              management of U.S. participation through the National Academy                  
              of Sciences, the program manager recommends an award.
