Abstract    :
              Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most                      
              powerful tool available to the chemist for the elucidation of                  
              the structure of molecules.  It is used to identify unknown                    
              substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within                 
              molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between                   
              molecules in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR                         
              spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out                     
              frontier research.                                                             
                                                                                             
              This award from the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program                   
              will help the Chemistry Department of the RUI institution,                     
              Franklin & Marshall College, to acquire, operate and maintain a                
              high-field NMR spectrometer.  The acquisition of the instrument                
              will enhance the ability of the Department to prepare                          
              undergraduates for possible careers in chemistry and will                      
              enhance research in the following areas:                                       
                                                                                             
              a)  The determination of equilibrium constants, stoichiometry,                 
                  and structures of Lewis adducts of model organometallic                    
                  halides of Groups 14 and 15                                                
                                                                                             
              b)  The determination of the structural determinants of                        
                  organometallic tautomerism and higher coordination                         
                                                                                             
              c)  Thermal rearrangements of bicyclic vinylcyclobutances and                  
                  stereoselective syntheses of substituted norbornanones and                 
                  norbornenones and,                                                         
                                                                                             
              d)  Investigations of infrared laser-induced organic reactions.                
                  The instrument will also be used in ongoing collaborative                  
                  projects with neighboring institutuions such as the                        
                  determination of substituent effects in phosphineborane                    
                  organometallics.
