Abstract    :
              This investigation is concerned with automated theorem proving in the          
              typed lambda calculus and with properties of the lambda calculus.  The         
              typed lambda calculus is a formulation of higher-order logic well              
              suited to the formalization of mathematics and other disciplines.  The         
              lambda calculus is both a logical theory and a model of computation.           
              It is fundamental to both higher-type theorem proving and functional           
              programming language design.                                                   
              Previous research has shown that one can search for a proof of a               
              theorem of typed lambda calculus by searching for an expansion proof           
              in natural deduction style.  Research will continue on methods for             
              finding expansion proofs, on various aspects of the lambda calculus,           
              and on related problems and questions.                                         
              Development of an existing computerized theorem proving system called          
              TPS will continue.  It will be enhanced as a practical and convenient          
              tool for investigating methods of searching for expansion proofs,              
              translating back and forth between expansion proofs and natural                
              deduction proofs, and constructing and checking formal proofs                  
              interactively, semi-automatically, and automatically.
