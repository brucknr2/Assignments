Abstract    :
              The PIs will develop and test a miniature open-cell CO2 and H20                
              (MICAH) sensor that can be inserted into the leaf chamber of a                 
              plant gas exchange system or used in eddy-covariance measurements              
              of canopy photosynthesis and transpiration.  The MICAH sensor                  
              will be developed at the Space Dynamics Laboratory by the                      
              technical personnel that recently delivered similar sensors to                 
              NASA for use in space suits.  This design will provide low-                    
              maintenance, battery-powered sensors connected to open-sided                   
              absorption cells using infrared transmitting fiber optics.                     
              Innovative miniature components and microprocessor control will                
              provide high-resolution performance in a hand-held, flexible                   
              instrument.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              This sensor is an important improvement in technology for plant                
              gas exchange because it will allow accurate measurements of non-               
              steady-state photosynthesis.  Measurements of this type are                    
              necessary in the study of plant responses to sunflecks, and have               
              been limited by the design of current instruments.  Because the                
              sensor will allow analysis of CO2 concentration in the leaf                    
              chamber directly, it will also allow the development of a true                 
              CO2 porometer, which will improve the speed, accuracy, and                     
              portability of field gas exchange systems.                                     
                                                                                             
              Following the successful development of this sensor, a cost-                   
              sharing arrangement with NSF to make copies of it available to                 
              scientists whose research is limited by current sensor technology              
              will proposed.
