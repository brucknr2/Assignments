Abstract    :
              Funds are requested to construct a high sensitivity, high time                 
              resolution flash spectrophotometer capable of measurements at UV,              
              visible and near IR wavelengths.  A flash lamp is used for                     
              interrogation of absorption signals, resulting in extremely high               
              optical resolution coupled with nanosecond time resolution.  The               
              use of fiber optic guides to direct light into and away from                   
              experimental samples allows the instrument to be easily                        
              reconfigured to measure fluorescence and luminescence, all of which            
              make use of essentially the same sensitive electronic components.              
                                                                                             
              This type of instrument is used often for biophysical studies of               
              photosynthetic material.  Accordingly, four of the major and one               
              of the minor users will concentrate on photosynthetic parameters               
              to evaluate models of protein translocation across biological                  
              membranes, responses of photosynthetic material to changing light              
              conditions, organization of the photosynthetic electron transport              
              chain, and intracellular communication between chloroplasts and                
              cell surfaces.  Proposed uses for instrument not directly related              
              to photosynthesis include determination of the viscosity of model              
              membranes around reconstituted membrane proteins, investigation of             
              the effects of mutations in the phytochrome apoprotein on                      
              phytochrome function, and development of sensitive assays for the              
              function of electrogenic ATPases.
