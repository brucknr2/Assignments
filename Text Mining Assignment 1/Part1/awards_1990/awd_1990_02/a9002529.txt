Abstract    :
                   The topological properties of an algebraic variety (the set               
              of solutions of some polynomial equations) will be studied in two              
              ways, using structures which are special to them.  First, there                
              are notions of size and distance on the smooth part of an                      
              algebraic variety, inherited from its imbedding in space.  Using               
              this, one defines square-summable functions and, more generally,               
              differential forms on the smooth part of the variety.  The first               
              problem to be studied is to what extent the periods of these                   
              functions or forms are determined by the topological properties                
              of the variety, in particular, by a topological invariant called               
              "the intersection homology group."  The second problem is to find              
              ways to relate quantitative measures of the intersection of                    
              cycles on the variety with its local topological properties.                   
                   These geometrical investigations will not be confined to the              
              non-singular case, rendering them more difficult, yet more                     
              suitable of application to spaces which arise in theoretical                   
              physics and in other analytic theories.
