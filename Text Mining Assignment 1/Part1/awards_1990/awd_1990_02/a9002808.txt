Abstract    :
                   The evaluation of climate models is a very important                      
              research goal for the atmospheric sciences.  One approach to                   
              evaluate climate models is to check their sensitivity to altered               
              boundary conditions and their ability to reproduce past                        
              environments on the earth.  This proposal requests support to                  
              continue research on modeling and analysis of past climate by                  
              focussing on the sensitivity of the climate system to variations               
              in the seasonal cycle, primarily for intervals in earth history                
              when a supercontinent dominated the surface of the earth.  The                 
              research will utilize a hierarchy of simple and complex models                 
              (EBM and GCM).  This research is important because it will help                
              to evaluate the past environmental conditions on earth and to                  
              understand the dynamics of the climate system.
