Abstract    :
                   The Principal Investigator will continue his study of the                 
              structure of smooth 4-manifolds, using techniques from geometry,               
              analysis and gauge theory.  At the heart of the investigation                  
              will be the classification of the diffeomorphism types of smooth               
              4-manifolds.  Since space-time is a 4-dimensional manifold, the                
              relevance of such investigations is plain.
