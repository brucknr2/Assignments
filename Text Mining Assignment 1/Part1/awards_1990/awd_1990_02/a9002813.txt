Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal requests funds to help provide support for student               
              participants at the 1990 Northeast Regional Conference on                      
              Developmental Biology. This Conference will be held at the Marine              
              Biological Laboratory, Woods Hole, Massachusetts, April 20-22,                 
              1990. The Conference will include four platform sessions, two                  
              poster sessions, a keynote address and ample opportunity for                   
              informal discussion of research. There are two general goals of                
              this Regional Meeting in bringing together younger investigators               
              in the field of developmental biology. The first is to expose                  
              them to important current research in laboratories throughout the              
              Northeast. The second is to give them a chance to present their                
              own work in both formal presentation as well as informal                       
              discussions. The specific goal of this 1990 meeting is to bring                
              together those investigators working on plant development and                  
              those working on animal development in order to develop a common               
              language and appreciation of each other's work.
