Abstract    :
                   This award will support a group from the University of                    
              California, Berkeley, who is involved in a research program in                 
              high energy particle physics. The research includes a search for               
              magnetic monopoles and for other hypothetical highly ionizing                  
              particles that might be produced in e+e- collisions at the LEP                 
              (CERN) collider.  This search will be done using etched plastic                
              track detectors.  It will also consist of the completion of the                
              analysis of data from a balloon-borne search of extragalactic                  
              heavy antinuclei in the cosmic rays using plastic track                        
              detectors, plastic scintillators and Cerenkov radiators.  A new                
              search will also be made for charged massive particles in the                  
              cosmic rays, or CHAMPS, that are speculated to have survived                   
              annihilation in the early universe and may be the dark matter of               
              our Galaxy.  This search will also be done by using etched                     
              plastic detectors.
