Abstract    :
                   Professor Sheu will conduct research on the interrelation                 
              between C* algebras and geometry, including the areas of                       
              algebraic quantization, K-theoretic problems involving Toeplitz                
              C* algebras and group C* algebras, Wiener-Hopf C* algebras on                  
              nilpotent groups, and singular foliation C* algebras.                          
                   The notion of a C* algebra is an abstraction of the idea of               
              a family of linear transformations on a space.  These                          
              transformations can also be thought of as objects that have                    
              values in certain states of the space, and the property of this                
              family which is responsible for the symbol * is that the algebra               
              is generated by transformations whose values in these states are               
              real numbers.  The fact that these objects appear naturally in                 
              many branches of mathematics and physics make them important to                
              study.
