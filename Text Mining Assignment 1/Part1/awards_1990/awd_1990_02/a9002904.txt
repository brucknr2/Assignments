Abstract    :
                   Work on this project will concentrate on problems arising in              
              the analysis of algebras generated by holomorphic or harmonic                  
              functions (function algebras).  A metric is used to measure the                
              distance between any two functions consisting of the maximum of                
              the function value differences, often referred to as the uniform               
              norm.  The underlying theme of the work concerns algebras of                   
              functions which lie between familiar algebras.  On a compact set               
              in the plane one considers the effect of adjoining a function to               
              a given function algebra (of holomorphic functions) and then                   
              completing the new collection into a larger algebra.  A                        
              fundamental question is whether or not the new algebra consists                
              of all continuous functions if the additional function was                     
              harmonic.  This is resolved in a recent work if the harmonic                   
              function is real-valued.  A clarification of the situation when                
              it is complex-valued remains to be done.                                       
                   Some progress has also been made in the setting of several                
              complex variables, where the same basic questions can be raised.               
              At the present time, the domains are restricted to balls and the               
              functions adjoined to the ball algebra of continuous holomorphic               
              functions must have continuous first derivatives.  A second goal               
              of this work will be to relax the differentiability condition                  
              which appears to be unnecessary.
