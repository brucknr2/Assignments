Abstract    :
                   This award is for partial support of United States                        
              scientists participation in the International Conference on                    
              Mechanics, Physics, and Structure of Materials to be held at                   
              Aristotle's University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece in                
              August 1990.  The main objective of this interdisciplinary                     
              meeting is to bring together specialists from various fields such              
              as engineering, physics, materials science, and mathematics and                
              contrast their views on mechanical behavior with emphasis on                   
              plastic flow and fracture.  Emphasis will be put on nonlinearity               
              and pattern forming instabilities, as well as their implications               
              into the understanding of the mechanical behavior of novel                     
              high-technological materials.  The relevance of the notions of                 
              bifurcation, self organization, fractals, and chaos will                       
              critically be examined for the case of solids and the their                    
              microstructures.  In this connection, the outstanding problem of               
              the transition from microscales to macroscales will again be                   
              addressed.
