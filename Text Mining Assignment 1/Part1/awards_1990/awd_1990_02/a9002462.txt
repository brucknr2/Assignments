Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research in p-adic analysis and                   
              algebraic geometry of Professor Diane Meuser of Boston                         
              University. Dr. Meuser's project involves an investigation of the              
              properties of p-adic complex powers, otherwise known as the Igusa              
              local zeta function. In particular, she intends to explore the                 
              connections between the behavior of the local zeta function and                
              the geometry of the algebraic variety from which this function is              
              derived.                                                                       
                   This is research in the field of algebraic geometry, one of               
              the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which has had a                
              revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century. In its                    
              origin, it treated figures that could be defined in the plane by               
              the simplest equations, namely polynomials. Nowadays the field                 
              makes use of methods not only from algebra, but from analysis and              
              topology, and conversely is finding application in those fields                
              as well as in physics, theoretical computer science, and robotics.
