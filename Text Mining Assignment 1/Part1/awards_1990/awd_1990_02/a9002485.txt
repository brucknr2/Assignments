Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal is to make carbon 14 measurements on the World                   
              Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) cruises in the central                     
              Pacific on longitude 150 west.  The carbon data are useful as                  
              tracers of the ocean circulation.  These measurements, along with              
              hydrographic and other tracer measurements will form the basis                 
              for ocean circulation descriptions and models which are the                    
              principal objectives of WOCE.
