Abstract    :
                   The proposal has two main components.  The first attempts to              
              describe nucleon structure, and the interactions between nucleons              
              in terms of Quantum Chromo dynamics, (QCD).  There are two                     
              regions with a straight forward connection: short distances,                   
              where asymptotic freedom allows a perturbative treatment in terms              
              of quarks and gluons, and large distances, where nucleons appear               
              as manifestations of the non-linear nature of QCD at large                     
              distances: the latter leads to a picture of nucleons as                        
              solutionis, and can be handled in the large N (number of colors)               
              and classical limit, while interactions between them can be                    
              described in terms of multi meson exchange. ("QCD at small q is a              
              complicated non-linear theory of mesons "Witten).  The aim is to               
              understand the connection between these two pictures.  As a start              
              1/N and quantum corrections to the solutionis picture are to be                
              tackled.  The second component is to continue the study of                     
              scattering theory with techniques that combine algebraic and                   
              analytic techniques: this has applications to molecular as well                
              as nuclear physics.
