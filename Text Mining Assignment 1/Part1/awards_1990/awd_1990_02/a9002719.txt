Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a SGER project to collect and to study the perishable                  
              earthquake and structural response/damage data due to the                      
              October 17, 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake.                                       
                                                                                             
              The thrust of this project is to conduct destructive tests on                  
              the remaining portion of the damaged bridge structure of the                   
              I-880 viaduct in Oakland, California.  Forced vibration tests                  
              of selected sections of the viaduct which are cut from the                     
              adjacent portions and shored will be performed to determine                    
              their dynamic properties possible retrofit procedures suitable                 
              for other similar double deck viaducts will be developed,                      
              tested, and evaluated conjunction with the Department of                       
              California Transportion (Caltrans).                                            
                                                                                             
              This study will provide invaluable information on the causes                   
              of the bridge failure, the safety of similar structures in                     
              California, Washington, and other states, and the improved                     
              retrofit procedures for such structures.
