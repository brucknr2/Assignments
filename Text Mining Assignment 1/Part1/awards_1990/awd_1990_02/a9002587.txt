Abstract    :
                   The study of 3-dimensional topology is often enriched by                  
              imposing extra structure on 3-manifolds.  A recent construction                
              due to Gabai shows that a 3-manifold supports many interesting                 
              dynamical systems, namely pseudo-Anosov flows.                                 
                   The first two parts of this project aim towards showing that              
              dynamical systems on a 3-manifold can be used to give complete                 
              information about an important topological invariant, the                      
              Thurston norm on homology.  The main work of the first part will               
              be to show that Gabai's flows are well-behaved enough to                       
              determine completely the Thurston norm.  The second part will                  
              focus on explicitly constructing these flows, so as to have an                 
              efficient algorithm for computing the norm.  A bonus will be a                 
              method for efficient computation of complete homeomorphism                     
              invariants of 3-manifolds which fiber over the circle.                         
                   The third and final part of this project addresses a long                 
              range goal, to investigate the conjecture that every 3-manifold                
              which is irreducible and contains a non-separating surface has a               
              finite cover which fibers over the circle.  Dynamical systems are              
              potentially useful for this investigation, due to work of Fried.               
              Mosher will attempt to prove the conjecture for some simple                    
              examples which are "as close as possible" to fibering without                  
              actually fibering.  If successful, this may yield suggestions for              
              an attack on the conjecture in general.
