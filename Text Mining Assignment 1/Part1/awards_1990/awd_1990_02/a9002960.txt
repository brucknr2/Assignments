Abstract    :
                This research project will concentrate on the analysis of the low            
              resolution spectra obtained with IRAS in order to establish the                
              characteristic dust grain signatures found in the 8-22 micron region.          
              With these spectra, Dr. Little-Marenin will be able to investigate and         
              possibly extend the chronology of dust formation and microwave maser           
              development in relatively older and optically thick circumstellar              
              shells associated with M stars.  The time variability of the emission          
              from the circumstellar shells will be investigated by analyzing the            
              IRAS broad band fluxes and the spectra of individual IRAS                      
              observations.  Analysis of the emission and absorption features                
              observed in the circumstellar shells associated with C stars should            
              provide observational evidence for the carbon-bearing dust grain               
              formation sequence that has been proposed.                                     
                In addition, Dr. Little-Marenin will teach an Introductory Astronomy         
              course, develop a research seminar on the late stages of stellar               
              evolution and organize a lecture series given by women astronomers.            
              She will also give departmental colloquia, seminars and informal               
              presentations.                                                                 
                This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to                
              provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in                    
              engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and             
              (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering by         
              providing greater visibility for women scientists and engineers                
              employed in industry, government, and academic institutions.  By               
              encouraging the participation of women in science, it is a valuable            
              investment in the Nation's future scientific vitality.
