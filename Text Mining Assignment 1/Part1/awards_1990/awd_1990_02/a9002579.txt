Abstract    :
                   Professors Varadarajan and Babbitt will work on a variety of              
              projects.  The first is a joint project involving the study of                 
              differential equations in a broad framework which relates them to              
              algebraic groups and their representations.  The questions to be               
              studied have broad significance in such areas as differential                  
              modules over schemes, moduli of vector bundles, theory of                      
              algebraic groups, asymptotic analysis, and invariant differential              
              operators and distributions.  Other projects involve                           
              representation theory of the Poincare group, and scattering                    
              theory in the quantum Heisenberg model.                                        
                   The joint project focuses on the behavior of solutions to                 
              differential equations with singularities as a function of                     
              external parameters.  The other projects fall under the heading                
              of mathematical physics and involve mathematical aspects of                    
              quantum theory.
