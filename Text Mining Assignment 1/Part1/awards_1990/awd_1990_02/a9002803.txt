Abstract    :
                   The investigators will continue development of new                        
              analytic approaches to homoclinic and heteroclinic bifurcation in              
              several important areas of applied dynamical systems.  In                      
              particular, they will continue development of a new                            
              bifurcation function approach to periodic and aperiodic                        
              solutions near homoclinic orbits and heteroclinic cycles.  They                
              will to continue development of a unified theory of interior                   
              layers of singular perturbation problems using heteroclinic                    
              bifurcation techniques and a version of the shadowing lemma.                   
              They will continue working with shock wave solutions of                        
              nonstrictly hyperbolic PDE's and PDE's that change type using                  
              heteroclinic bifurcation techniques.  They will extend a                       
              new  rigorous algorithm for numerical continuation of homoclinic               
              and heteroclinic orbits to include continuation to the point                   
              where an equilibrium becomes nonhyperbolic.  Finally, they                     
              will investigate nonhomogeneous solutions of reaction-diffusion                
              equations near spatially homogeneous solutions represented by                  
              homoclinic orbits or heteroclinic cycles of an ODE.
