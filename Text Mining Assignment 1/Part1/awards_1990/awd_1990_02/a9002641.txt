Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The principal investigator will study the geometry and                    
              manifold structure of Teichmuller space.  He will focus his                    
              investigations on the infinite as well as finite dimensional                   
              cases.  The project will have applications to three-dimensional                
              topology, string theory, dynamical systems, and iteration of                   
              rational functions.                                                            
                   A Teichmuller space consists of the set of all "markings" of              
              a surface with a finite number of holes and a finite number of                 
              punctures.  For example, a punctured inner tube has one hole and               
              one puncture.  A marking is a distinguished basis for the                      
              fundamental group of the surface.  This might consist of several               
              circles about the holes and punctures.  The principal                          
              investigator will apply his theories of Teichmuller space to a                 
              variety of other applications within mathematics.
