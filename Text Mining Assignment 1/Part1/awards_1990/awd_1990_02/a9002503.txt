Abstract    :
              This award provides partial support for the                                    
              U.S. Panel on Wind and Seismic Effects.  The                                   
              Panel was created in 1968.  Annual meetings                                    
              alternate between Japan and the U.S.  The                                      
              Panel develops technologies that advance                                       
              engineering design and construction practices                                  
              and improve the quality-of-life.  The Panel is                                 
              composed of 16 Federal agencies who                                            
              participate in nine task committees.  The task                                 
              committees focus on specific national issues,                                  
              e.g., earthquake hazards reduction, buried                                     
              pipelines, transportation and                                                  
              telecommunication systems, repair and retrofit                                 
              of structures.  The results of task committee                                  
              workshops and conferences are shared at the                                    
              annual joint meeting and usually published as                                  
              proceedings.
