Abstract    :
              This research project is concerned with the emission of light from             
              metal-oxide-metal tunnel junctions as a probe of the interaction               
              between the tunneling current and the surface plasmon-polaritons of            
              the tunnel junction structure.  The light emission is mediated by              
              the morphology of the structure.  The objective is to provide                  
              direct confirmation that the dominant mode for the emission of                 
              light is the slow mode, which has large fields in the oxide layer.             
              Junctions will be grown on gratings with periods between 70 and 100            
              nanometers in order to provide the momentum mismatch between the               
              slow mode and the emitted light.
