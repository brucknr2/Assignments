Abstract    :
                   The principal investigators will work on some problems in                 
              modeling financial markets.  The work will include contingent                  
              claim pricing, utility maximization and equilibrium existence and              
              characterization in securities markets which exhibit various                   
              kinds of incompleteness.  Securities are modelled as Ito                       
              processes.  Incompleteness in these models can arise because                   
              there are too few securities to hedge all the risk associated                  
              with the underlying Brownian motion, because there are                         
              constraints on admissible portfolios such as short-selling                     
              prohibition, or because of transaction costs.  The problem with                
              different interest rates for borrowing and investing will also be              
              examined.
