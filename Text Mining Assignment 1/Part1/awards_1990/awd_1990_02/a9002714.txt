Abstract    :
                   NSF will share in the costs of operating a data                           
              communications link between the NORDUnet node in Sweden and the                
              NSFNET backbone node at the JvNCnet site in Princeton, NJ.                     
              NORDUnet links the academic and research networks of five Nordic               
              countries: Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden.                       
              Collectively, the exchange of NORDUnet traffic with the NSFNET                 
              backbone accounted for over half of the total exchange between                 
              european countries and the NSFNET backbone as of July, 1989.  The              
              existing link, heretofore fully paid for by the NORDUNET Project,              
              is used to capacity for collaborative exchanges between US and                 
              Nordic researchers.
