Abstract    :
                   This project has two parts.  Part A involves work in                      
              nonlinear partial differential equations and the calculus of                   
              variations (Exterior Domain Problems, Prescribed Mean Curvature                
              Problems and Perturbation of even Functionals, Lavrentiev gap,                 
              Lavrentiev envelope, homogeneous materials with layered                        
              microstructure, gradients with no rank-one connections).  Part B               
              deals with stochastic control and stochastic analysis (Bolza                   
              problems, Boundary value problems with noise, Kolmogorov                       
              differential equations).  Most of these problems attempt to                    
              answer questions in engineering and physical sciences.
