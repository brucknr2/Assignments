Abstract    :
                   This project will support research on several problems in                 
              the areas of nonlinear harmonic analysis and partial differential              
              equations.  Among the topics to be studied are the method of                   
              layer potentials for the heat equation in time-varying domains,                
              Hardy spaces and boundary value problems for operators of Dirac                
              type on Lipschitz domains, the characterization of the spaces of               
              uniform holomorphy for partial sum operators for classical                     
              expansions, the calculation of the spectral radius of the trace                
              of the double-layer potential for harmonic functions in certain                
              domains, and applications of nonlinear harmonic analysis to                    
              problems in nonlinear partial differential equations.                          
                   Nonlinear harmonic analysis emerged and developed in                      
              response to the challenges posed by difficult problems in                      
              classical analysis, particularly, but not exclusively, those                   
              arising from the study of partial differential equations.  It is               
              anticipated that applications of this work will lead to a better               
              understanding of potential theory and the parabolic partial                    
              differential equations of heat flow.
