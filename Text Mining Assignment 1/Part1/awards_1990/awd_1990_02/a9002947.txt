Abstract    :
                This research is to use seismological, thermodynamic, mineral                
              physics and experimental petrological data to infer, with error                
              estimates, the mineralogy of the various regions of the mantle.                
              Recent seismological work is providing high-resolution models for              
              the radial variation, and useful resolution for lateral variation              
              of seismic properties.  The absolute values of these parameters,               
              their gradients and their interrelationships provide data                      
              pertinent to the chemistry, mineralogy and temperature of the                  
              mantle.  Two of the outstanding questions in mantle dynamics and               
              chemistry are whether mantle discontinuities represent chemical                
              as well as phase changes and whether the lateral variations are                
              entirely due to temperature.  Recent work on the elastic                       
              properties of perovskite and on the partitioning of Fe between                 
              perovskite and magnesiowustite will help us constrain the                      
              chemistry and thermodynamics of the lower mantle.
