Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Liblice Conferences aze international meetings held every three            
              years and devoted to both basic research and applications of                   
              molecular theories of liquids.  They are sponsored by the Chemical             
              Physics section of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences.  A                    
              possible counterpart in the US is the biennial Gordon Conference               
              on the Chemistry and Physics of Liquids, which is a national and               
              somewhat international forum on experimental work on and molecular-            
              level modeling of dense fluids phases.  The Liblice conferences,               
              however, draw a wider segment of their audience from the European              
              continent, including, of course, the Eastern European countries.               
                                                                                             
              The Third Liblice Conference will take place from May 28 to                    
              June 1, 1990 in Bechyne, Czechoslovakia, is intended to                        
              provide an effective opportunity for personal contacts and                     
              exchange of ideas, with emphasis on discussions, in addition                   
              to formal presentations.  The meeting should also present a                    
              state-of-the-art picture of the achievements and challenges in                 
              both the fundamental and applied aspects of the discipline.                    
              It is an event of significant and the US presence is                           
              critically important.
