Abstract    :
              Formal representation of uncertainty is needed for taking account              
              of partial knowledge, for dealing with uncertain data, for making              
              decisions in uncertain circumstances.  Probability theory                      
              provides the classical way of representing uncertainty, but                    
              numerous other representations have been proposed.  These                      
              representations have a lot in common.  This work will survey                   
              these proposals, with a view to exploring their relations.  One                
              approach which may serve to provide a general framework is the                 
              set-of-classical-distributions approach.  Many representations                 
              of uncertainty can be construed as sets of distributions subject               
              to a certain class of constraints.  For example, Shafer's support              
              functions can be seen as the infima of sets of distributions                   
              subject to the constraints of convexity and a special additivity               
              constraint.  This mechanism will be used to explore the relations              
              among the various views.  Finally, supposing that the constraints              
              on the set of distributions come from general statistical                      
              knowledge in a database, this project will explore the problem of              
              the feasible computation of uncertainties relative to such a                   
              database.
