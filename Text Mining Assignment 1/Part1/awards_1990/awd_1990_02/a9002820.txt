Abstract    :
              The test results of a bridge will be used to calibrate standards               
              for strength evaluation of existing bridges.  Nondestructive test              
              procedures for bridge condition evaluation being researched by the             
              University of Cincinnati will also be calibrated.  It is proposed              
              to further exploit this test for the advancement of analytical                 
              modeling and nonlinear analysis of reinforced concrete structures.             
              Collaborating researchers from the University of Cincinnati and                
              Wiss, Janney, Elstner Associates will design, conduct and document             
              the test as a benchmark experiment for validating and calibrating              
              RC bridge analytical finite-element modeling and analysis.                     
              Instrumentation will be designed and installed to measure local and            
              global responses to serve this purpose.  Information will be                   
              documented, archived and disseminated to permit analytical model               
              generation and response simulation by analytical researchers.
