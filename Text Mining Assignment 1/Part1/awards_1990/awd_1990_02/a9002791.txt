Abstract    :
                   Stochastic approximation techniques will be applied to                    
              develop computational algorithms for the statistical analysis of               
              spatial processes and for the control of laboratory instruments.               
              Both the practical implementation and theoretical properties of                
              the algorithms will be investigated.  New methods for locating                 
              variable-stabilizing transformations will be studied.  These                   
              methods will be based on a nonparametric estimate of the variance              
              function.  These new techniques are promising for multivariate                 
              transformation families such as the shifted-power transformations              
              and nonparametric spline transformations.  Transformations will                
              also be investigated in the context of density estimation.  The                
              method to be investigated consists of transforming the data to a               
              density that can be accurately estimated by a kernel estimator,                
              applying a kernel estimator, and transforming this estimate back               
              to the original space to estimate the density of the original                  
              data. Source appointment is a methodology for attributing                      
              pollution to its sources by chemical mass balance.  Source                     
              apportionment when the composition of one source is unknown will               
              be investigated.  Nonlinear regression will be studied when there              
              are measurement errors in the independent variables and no                     
              replication.
