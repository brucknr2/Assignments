Abstract    :
              Failure of concrete structures during construction constitutes a               
              significant percentage of construction failures.  Among the causes             
              of formwork failure are inadequate strength and overloading.  The              
              proposed study will concentrate on developing probability models               
              for predicting the resistances and stiffnesses of handset wood slab            
              formworks commonly used in multistory concrete construction.  The              
              behavior of a formwork system is not only a function of the                    
              strength and the physical condition of its members but also the                
              quality of its installation workmanship.  Therefore, to develop                
              formwork load-deformation and resistance models, samples of                    
              formwork members and form installation workmanship data will be                
              collected from several construction sites.  Each collected member              
              sample will be erected in the lab for test with the same                       
              installation deviations and inaccuracies measured for it at the                
              construction site.  The tests results will be used to derive                   
              probability models expressing the resistance and stiffness of wood             
              formworks.
