              This is a SGER project to collect and to study                                 
              the perishable earthquake and structural                                       
              response/damage data due to the

              This project provides travel support for field                                 
              investigation to collect perishable data for                                   
              shear wall buildings.  The data collection is                                  
              focused on both damaged and undamaged                                          
              buildings.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              The general and performance data collected                                     
              will be made available to the general research                                 
              community as a valuable information source for                                 
              their future research.
