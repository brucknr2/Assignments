Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research in arithmetic algebraic                  
              geometry of Professor Ching-Li Chai of the University of                       
              Pennsylvania. Dr. Chai has proposed to work on two projects: the               
              first is to investigate level structures over extraordinary                    
              primes, and the second is to construct rigid homogeneous spaces.               
              Both of these projects are related to the arithmetic of                        
              automorphic forms and Shimura varieties.                                       
                   This is research in the field of arithmetic algebraic                     
              geometry, a subject that combines the techniques of algebraic                  
              geometry and number theory. In its original formulation,                       
              algebraic geometry treated figures that could be defined in the                
              plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials. Number                    
              theory started with the whole numbers and such questions as                    
              divisibility of one whole number by another. These two subjects,               
              seemingly so far apart, have in fact influenced each other from                
              the earliest times, but in the past quarter century the mutual                 
              influence has increased greatly. The field of arithmetic                       
              algebraic geometry now uses techniques from all of modern                      
              mathematics, and is having corresponding influence beyond its own              
              borders.
