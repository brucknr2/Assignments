Abstract    :
              Dr. Jorge Colon has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research                       
              Fellowship in Chemistry.  Dr. Colon's doctoral degree was from                 
              Texas A & M University under the supervision of Professor                      
              Charles R. Martin.  Dr. Colon intends to continue research at                  
              the California Institute of Technology under the sponsorship of                
              Professor Harry Gray.  Dr. Colon's area of postdoctoral                        
              training and research will be photoinduced electron transfer                   
              reactions of metal complexes.  These studies will ultimately be                
              applied to long-range electron transfer in proteins and in                     
              model systems relevant to solar energy conversion.                             
                                                                                             
              The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as                 
              an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the                   
              knowledge and experience of new Ph.D's and attract them into                   
              meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and                       
              teaching.
