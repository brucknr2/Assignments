Abstract    :
                   This research will focus on three areas: 1) Stability and                 
              instability of quantum Hamiltonians with dense point and singular              
              spectra; 2) Existence of absolutely continuous spectra of                      
              Schrodinger operators with random potential; and 3) Solutions of               
              a commutator inequality which arose in connection with random                  
              Hamiltonians.                                                                  
                   This work is in the general area of mathematical physics.                 
              The problem examined by this researcher is to some extent a                    
              simple quantum analogue of the KAM problem in classical                        
              mechanics.  Problems of this sort with time-periodic potentials                
              are of considerable physical interest, particularly in connection              
              with atoms in laser fields.
