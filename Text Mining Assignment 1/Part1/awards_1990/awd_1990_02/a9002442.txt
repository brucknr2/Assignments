Abstract    :
              The objective of this project are to identify and quantify                     
              chemical reaction products when chlorine is used to                            
              disinfect wastewater treatment plant effluents.  Special                       
              emphasis in this project is on reactions between                               
              nitrogenous organic compounds such as the amino acids and                      
              peptides in the effluents with chlorine.  Spectral                             
              techniques are planned to be used for identification of                        
              the chlorination products, in the process of                                   
              characterizing their stability and to determine how                            
              conventional methods of analysis respond to the presence                       
              of these compounds.                                                            
                                                                                             
              Chlorination is relied on heavily in the United States for                     
              disinfection of effluents prior to their placement in                          
              environmental waters.  Chlorine is known to react with                         
              organic compounds to form products many of which have not                      
              been fully characterized with respect to their                                 
              environmental significance for downstream water users.                         
              Results of this project are expected to provide the basis                      
              for any changes that may be necessary in engineering                           
              design and use of chlorination to avoid or eliminate                           
              environmental problems associated with use of this                             
              process.
