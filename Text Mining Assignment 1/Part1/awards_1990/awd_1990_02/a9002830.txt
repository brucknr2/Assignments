Abstract    :
                   This grant is primarily for graduate students travel to the               
              Gordon Research Conference, entitled "Modelling in Solar                       
              TerrestriaL Physics." which will be held at the Plymouth State                 
              College, in Plymouth New Hampshire on July 30th through August                 
              3rd, 1990.  This conference on the physical and mathematical                   
              basis for the various modelling efforts underway is very timely.               
              By inviting atmospheric scientists to describe and review the                  
              methods used in their already successful modelling efforts, the                
              conference has the potential of simulating rapid progress in the               
              task of unifying fast microscale phenomena with slower macroscale              
              phenomena in computational models of geospace.  This conference                
              will provide an excellent forum for informal exchange between                  
              space and atmosphere physicists that will enhance greatly our                  
              understanding of the issues and processes involved. ***//
