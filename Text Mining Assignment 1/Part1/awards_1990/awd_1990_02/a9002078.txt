Abstract    :
              This proposal requests funds to obtain a scanning                              
              spectrofluorimeter, associated epifluorescense microscope and                  
              computer.  The instrumentation will be used in the research                    
              programs of several investigators, all of whom need to measure                 
              intracellular ion concentrations using various ion sensitive                   
              dyes.  The specific projects in this proposal will investigate                 
              the role of intracellular calcium in cell volume recovery by                   
              invertebrate blood cells following a hypoosmotic stress; the role              
              of calcium in acetylcholine receptor differentiation; the role of              
              calcium in visual transduction in Limulus eye and vertebrate                   
              retina; the role of calcium fluctuations in the regulation of                  
              mitosis in plants.
