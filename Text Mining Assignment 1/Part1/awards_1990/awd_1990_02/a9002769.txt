Abstract    :
                   This research is concerned with noncommutative algebra,                   
              particularly the theory of noncommutative noetherian rings and                 
              its applications to other areas of mathematics.  The principal                 
              investigator will study the abstract properties of nontrivial                  
              examples and their interrelationship with the theory of quantum                
              groups.  He will also consider the skew group ring of a finite                 
              group acting on a polynomial ring to determine when the category               
              of projective modules over such a ring satisfies cancellation.                 
              The postdoctoral associate will study the stable rank of                       
              enveloping algebras of semisimple Lie algebras.                                
                   A ring is an algebraic object having both an addition and a               
              multiplication defined on it.  Although the additive operation                 
              satisfies the commutative law, the multiplicative operation is                 
              not required to do so.  The study of noncommutative rings has                  
              become an important part of algebra because of its increasing                  
              significance to other branches of mathematics and physics.
