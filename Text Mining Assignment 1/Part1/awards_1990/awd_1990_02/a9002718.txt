Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a SGER project to collect and to study the perishable                  
              earthquake and structural response/damage data due to the                      
              October 17, 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake.                                       
                                                                                             
              The focus of this project is to assess the performance of                      
              previously retrofitted buildings, a unique opportunity for                     
              this kind of study made possible by this particular event.                     
              The work to be conducted includes:                                             
                                                                                             
                 (1)  documentation of observed damages of several (3-10)                    
                             buildings,                                                      
                                                                                             
                 (2)  detailed analysis of seismic behavior                                  
                                                                                             
                 (3)  field testing of damaged buildings for their dynamic                   
                      properties,                                                            
                                                                                             
                 (4)  destructive tests as necessary and as permitted by the                 
                      owner, and                                                             
                                                                                             
                 (5)  identification of improved retrofitting techniques.                    
                                                                                             
              In addition, tests of wood frame connections will be carried                   
              out to assess the seismic performance of plywood shear walls.
