Abstract    :
                   Professor Salinas will pursue his research on multivariable               
              operator theory, including Toeplitz C* algebras on bounded                     
              domains in n variables, weighted Wiener-Hopf operators, and joint              
              quasitriangularity of operators and quasidiagonality of C*                     
              algebras.  Professor Upmeier will continue and expand his work on              
              multivariable Toeplitz operators, C* algebras, and index theory.               
              He will also study quantization procedures on manifolds.  Dr.                  
              Zhang will continue his work on the structure of certain simple                
              C* algebras and multiplier and corona algebras of certain types                
              of C* algebras.                                                                
                   The notion of a C* algebra is an abstraction of the idea of               
              a family of linear transformations on a space.  These                          
              transformations can also be thought of as having values in the                 
              states of the space, and the property of this family which is                  
              responsible for the symbol * is that the algebra is generated by               
              transformations whose values in these states are real numbers.                 
              The fact that these objects appear naturally in many branches of               
              mathematics and physics make them important to study.
