Abstract    :
                   Numerical analysis is of importance in an increasing number               
              of areas, owing in part to the ever - expanding role of                        
              computation in the mathematical sciences.                                      
                   Many algorithms in numerical analysis use polynomials                     
              orthogonal on (a subset of) a real interval.  These algorithms                 
              include schemes for polynomial least squares approximation,                    
              Gaussian quadrature, and the Lanczos and conjugate gradient                    
              methods.  It is planned to develop analogous algorithms that use               
              polynomials orthogonal on the unit circle, also known as Szego                 
              polynomials.  Szego polynomials are related to approximation by                
              trigonometric polynomials, similarly as polynomials orthogonal                 
              on an interval are related to approximation by (algebraic)                     
              polynomials.  Szego polynomials satisfy a recurrence relation                  
              with few terms.  This makes them attractive to use in                          
              computations.  They have already been applied successfully in                  
              algorithms for computing eigenvalues of unitary matrices, a                    
              problem that arises in certain frequency estimation methods in                 
              signal processing.
