Abstract    :
                   This research explores various applications of the extension              
              theorems and commutant lifting theorems for contraction operators              
              on Krein spaces.  Some of these problems, such as the Krein space              
              formulation of Foias' generalization of an interpolation problem               
              of Dym and Gohberg, are natural restatements of classical Hilbert              
              space problems. Other of these problems, such as the study of                  
              maximal negative subspaces of bicontractive operators, make sense              
              only within the context of indefinite inner product spaces.                    
                   This research is in the general area of modern analysis.                  
              Its focus is on the commutant lifting theorems for certain                     
              classes of operators on Krein spaces.  For Hilbert space                       
              contractions, the lifting theorem has been well known since the                
              late 1960's and has been a powerful tool in areas such as                      
              classical interpolation theory and in corona theory.
