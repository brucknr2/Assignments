Abstract    :
                   The purpose of this project is to study a new class of rank               
              statistics for analyzing nonserial dependent data with missing                 
              observations. The dependencies are assumed to come from                        
              multivariate data or repeated measures data. Nonparametric                     
              methods which do not involve the assumption of normally                        
              distributed data are to be developed. The testing and estimation               
              procedures proposed will be based on asymptotic distributions of               
              ranks of dependent data. They incorporate intercomponent and                   
              interblock rankings and, as a result, are applicable to a much                 
              wider class of problems with nonserial dependent data. They will               
              also have improved power properties.
