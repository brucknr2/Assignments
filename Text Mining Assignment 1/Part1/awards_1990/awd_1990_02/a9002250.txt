Abstract    :
                   The research focuses on the interaction of atomic particles               
              with electromagnetic fields.  The major theme is the study of the              
              effects of strong, oscillating fields on bound-free transitions.               
              Negative ions are studied because it is easier to understand the               
              short range interaction from both an experimental and                          
              theoretical point of view.  The second major theme of the                      
              research is the study of the correlations in two electron atomic               
              systems such as the negative alkali ions.  These are easily                    
              accessible with tunable dye lasers and the experiments will be                 
              carried out using laser photodetachment in an ion beam and an ion              
              trap.  The work will lead to an enhanced understanding of the                  
              interaction of strong, oscillating fields with atoms and of                    
              electron correlation effects.
