Abstract    :
              The object of this research project is to show the                             
              feasibility of an advanced concept, video imaging                              
              microscope whose features include real-time, three-                            
              color video images, instantaneous zoom, very low                               
              illumination power, selective contrast enhancement,                            
              and highly linear densitometry.  Data resolution                               
              matched the diffraction limit of the optics over a wide                        
              range of magnification.  Low cost, direct viewing                              
              models would be useful for routine clinical                                    
              applications and multi-user observation of cell smears                         
              or sections in pathology, hematopathlogy, and                                  
              cytology.  Such a system could be the ideal vehicle for                        
              the creation of video teaching databases of                                    
              pathological abnormalities, and provide the critical                           
              link between optical microscopy and the rapidly                                
              expanding area of video image display, storage,                                
              processing, and teleconferencing.  Expanded feature                            
              models with automated stages, automatic focusing,                              
              and computerized image processing facilities would                             
              be useful for the development of automated cell                                
              analysis in pathology, hematology , cytology, and                              
              many other disciplines.
