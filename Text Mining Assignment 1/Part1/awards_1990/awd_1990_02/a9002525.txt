Abstract    :
                   This research project involves work in several areas of                   
              algebraic topology.  First of all, the principal investigator                  
              intends to continue his work with Stefan Jackowski and Bob Oliver              
              on the homotopy theory of classifying spaces.  Secondly, the                   
              principal investigator will attempt to apply the methods                       
              developed in that work to prove a stable version of Barratt's                  
              exponent conjecture.  Finally, the principal investigator will                 
              continue his work with Ross Staffeldt on Topological Hochschild                
              Homology and Waldhausen K-theory.                                              
                   To summarize, a variety of efforts will be pursued to                     
              explore, to perfect, and to apply sophisticated algebraic                      
              techniques in order better to understand and classify topological              
              (i.e., a kind of geometric) structures.
