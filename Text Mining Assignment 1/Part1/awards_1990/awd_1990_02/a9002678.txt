Abstract    :
                   This award provides one-half the funding for the acquisition              
              of a computing system for the International Seismological Center               
              (ISC). The ISC has committed the remaining half of the funds                   
              required.                                                                      
                   The International Seismological Center is the organization                
              charged with the task of assembling final seismological                        
              observations, deriving definitive hypocentral solutions and                    
              magnitudes of earthquakes on a world-wide basis. The hypocenters               
              and observations are archived on magnetic tape. The new computer               
              system will be used to store readings, compute focal parameters                
              and to prepare files of data on magnetic tape and in printed form              
              for external users, including over 80 institutions in the U.S.                 
              The data are used as the basis for studies of earthquake                       
              mechanisms, earth structure and global seismicity.
