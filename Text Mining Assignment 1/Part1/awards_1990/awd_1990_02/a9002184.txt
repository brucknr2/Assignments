Abstract    :
              Dr. Patrick J. Walsh has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research                  
              Fellowship in Chemistry. Dr. Walsh's doctoral degree was from                  
              the University of California (Berkeley) under the supervision                  
              of Professor Robert G. Bergman. Dr. Walsh intends to continue                  
              research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology under the                
              sponsorship of Professor K. Barry Sharpless.  Dr. Walsh's area                 
              of postdoctoral research and training will be the application                  
              of transition metal catalysis to synthetic organic chemistry.                  
              His long-term research interests are concerned with the                        
              asymmetric aziridination of olefins by transition metals.                      
                                                                                             
              The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is                  
              viewed as an important infrastructural program designed to                     
              broaden the knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.s and attract                 
              them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research                 
              and teaching.
