Abstract    :
              This award provides funds for research and research training in the            
              application of mass spectrometry to the analysis of polysaccharides            
              and the carbohydrate portions of glycolipids and proteoglycans.                
              Research trainees will participate in a variety of projects dealing            
              with macromolecules of biological interest from animal, plant and              
              microbial sources.  Development of new techniques in mass                      
              spectroscopy relevant to analysis of glycans will form an integral             
              part of the activities envisioned.                                             
                                                                                             
              In recent years, there has been growing interest understanding the             
              structure of polysacharrides in bacterial and plant cell walls and             
              to the analysis of the oligosaccharide moieties commonly found on              
              a variety of cellular and extracellular macromolecules.  While                 
              traditional methods of chemicals analysis have remained tedious,               
              mass spectrometry has made it increasingly the method of choice for            
              the analysis of such glycans.  This award recognizes the need for              
              more investigators skilled in the use of mass spectrometry in this             
              area, and for the continued development of the techniques necessary            
              for analysis of glycans.
