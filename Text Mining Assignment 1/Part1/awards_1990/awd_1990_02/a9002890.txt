Abstract    :
              This project consists of an experimental study of the first onset              
              of dissipation in the flow of superfluid 4He through an orifice                
              of micron or submicron dimensions as the rate of flow surpasses a              
              critical threshold.  Measurements will be made of the magnitude                
              of the critical rate of flow and its dependence on temperature,                
              pressure, and shape of orifice and of any statistical rounding of              
              the onset as a function of temperature, in order to gain                       
              information about the fundamental processes involved, for which                
              no satisfactory model now exists.  Use will be made of a small                 
              mechanical resonator capable of resolving single-quantum-vortex                
              events in the oscillatory flow of superfluid through an orifice                
              that is fabricated by means of electron-beam lithography and ion-              
              beam milling or reactive plasma etching.  Studies will be made                 
              using both a single-hole configuration and a closed-loop                       
              configuration analogous to an rf-biased superconducting quantum                
              interference device.
