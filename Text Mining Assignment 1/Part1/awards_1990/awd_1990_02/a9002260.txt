Abstract    :
                   Molecular studies of phenotypic evolution within the                      
              Californian-endemic, annual genus Calycadenia are proposed.                    
              Unusual and well-resolved patterns of chromosomal, flavonoid, and              
              morphological evolution among these ca. 12 species and 30 races                
              or forms make Calycadenia a model system for examining questions               
              of broad systematic significance.  Integrated chloropast DNA and               
              nuclear DNA restriction site polymorphism analyses are proposed                
              to determine patterns and relative timing of evolutionary                      
              divergence of these taxa and accompanying phenotypic characters.               
              Issues addressed by this study would include (1) the role of                   
              selection in chromosome evolution, (2) the relationship between                
              evolutionary divergence and chromosome pairing, (3) the extent of              
              evolutionary parallelism in complex anatomical features, (4) the               
              possible origin from within Calycadenia of two highly-distinctive              
              monotypic genera (Osmadenia and Blepharipappus) and their                      
              accompanying suites of unique phenotypic characters, and (5) the               
              taxinomic validity of a proposed-endangered species,                           
              C.fremontii.  This study would be among the first to integrate                 
              extensive phylogenetically-informative data from cytogenetics,                 
              phytochemistry, and morphology with evolutionary data from                     
              diverse nucleotide sequences in both chloroplast and nuclear DNA.              
              Preliminary chloroplast DNA restriction site data revealed an                  
              ideal level of interspecific variation for conducting molecular                
              phylogenetic analysis in this group.     //
