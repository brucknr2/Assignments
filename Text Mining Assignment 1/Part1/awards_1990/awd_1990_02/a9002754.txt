Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project focuses on the Loma Prieta earthquake.  The                       
              Institute for Social Science Research (ISSR) and the School                    
              of Public Health at the University of California, Los Angeles,                 
              with consultative assistance from the southern California                      
              Earthquake Preparedness Project (SCEPP), will collect                          
              perishable data from a representative sample of 375                            
              respondents in the San Francisco Bay Area.  The data will be                   
              collected by telephone interview.  Using an instrument                         
              designed for the collection of data from Los Angeles following                 
              the Whittier Narrows earthquake of October 1, 1987, the data                   
              collected will assess community members' experiences during                    
              and after, and reactions to, the Loma Prieta earthquake of                     
              October 17, 1989.  Creation of this unique data set will allow                 
              for the comparison of community members in the two most                        
              earthquake-prone urban areas of the United States.
