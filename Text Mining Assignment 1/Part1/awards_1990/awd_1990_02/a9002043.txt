Abstract    :
                   A central goal of this mathematical research is the use of                
              newly developed relationships between special functions applied                
              to the evaluation of complex integrals.  The primary focus is                  
              that of the famous Selberg formula for the integration of                      
              symmetric functions multiplied against the Vandermonde                         
              determinant, acting as a weight. Work will continue addressing                 
              possible extensions of this closed form expression.                            
                   Initial efforts will be made to establish a formula for the               
              ratios of alternantes to the Selberg symmetric functions.  It is               
              expected that they will be given explicitly in terms of                        
              tournaments.  Work will also be done on beta type distributions                
              and their orthogonal polynomials.  In addition, the                            
              classification of functions which provide extensions of the q-                 
              Dyson theorem of Zeilberger and Bressoud will be sought.  It is                
              conjectured that not all such functions will turn out to be                    
              symmetric.
