Abstract    :
                   This project studies uniqueness and stability of solutions                
              of well-known but ill-posed inverse problems.  It considers the                
              inverse problem of potential theory that is fundamental in                     
              geophysics, the inverse conductivity problem with applications in              
              electrical tomography and in crack detection and a non-hyperbolic              
              Cauchy problem for hyperbolic equations as well as related heat                
              conduction parameter identification, earthquakes prediction and                
              acoustic and seismic prospecting.  The work will involve some                  
              classical (potential theory, Carleman type and energy estimates,               
              orthogonality relations) and more recent methods ( the                         
              logarithmic convexity and the Calderon-Sylvester-Uhlmann's                     
              method).  The aim is to solve fundamental questions, provide                   
              applications and derive new mathematical tools.
