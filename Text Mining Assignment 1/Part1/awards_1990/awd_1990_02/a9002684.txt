Abstract    :
                                                                                              
               Weber State College will connect their campus network to                     
              WESTNET (a regional network which is part of the NSFNET).  Direct              
              connection to WESTNET will provide researchers with improved                   
              access to national networks such as CSNET/Bitnet and USENET.                   
              Improvement is sought in reliability, speed, turn-around,                      
              flexibility, and functions such as file transfer, remote login,                
              and teleconferencing.                                                          
                                                                                             
                The Weber State College connection to WESTNET will support and               
              enhance currency and excellence in teaching and research by                    
              facilitating collaborative research, curriculum development, as                
              well as communication among national committees on which faculty               
              serve and chair.  Access though WESTNET to bibliographic material              
              and to computer systems not available on campus such as                        
              supercomputers will broaden the computing base for both faculty                
              and students.  This universal availablity will enhance students'               
              preparation for courses and seminars and will especially impact                
              students in science and engineering.***//
