Abstract    :
              This award will provide supplemental support to enable Dr. Robin               
              Staffin of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory to conduct               
              collaborative research for 12 months with Dr. Toshihisa Tomie of               
              the Electrotechnical Laboratory in Tsukuba, Japan.  They will                  
              investigate the physics of plasma x-ray lasers, with a goal of                 
              scaling to shorter wavelengths to enable holographic imaging of                
              live biological specimens.                                                     
                                                                                             
              Since the demonstration five years ago of a laboratory x-ray                   
              laser, there has been a world-wide pursuit to extend lasing to                 
              higher powers, shorter wavelengths, and smaller divergence.  This              
              research will investigate the physics of plasma x-ray lasers via               
              physical and numerical modeling, calculations of laser gain,                   
              trapping and propagation, and analysis of the conditions and                   
              requirements for x-ray laser coherence.  The Krf excimer laser at              
              the Electrotechnical Laboratory is well suited to these studies,               
              and is complemented by the availability of Cray and Fujitsu                    
              supercomputers, which are necessary for the modeling studies.  The             
              collaboration between Dr. Tomie, an experimentalist, and Dr.                   
              Staffin, a theoretical modeler, should prove synergistic.
