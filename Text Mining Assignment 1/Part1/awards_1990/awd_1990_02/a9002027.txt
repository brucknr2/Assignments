Abstract    :
              Ultracentrifugation can provide direct, quantitative information               
              concerning the purity, size, shape and interactions of biological              
              macromolecules.  The development of a modern analytical                        
              ultracentrifuge methods for macromolecules and automated methods               
              for the analysis and interpretation of ultracentrifugal data is                
              important for advances in molecular biology.  The tasks addressed              
              by this proposal include:  1) completing the development of real-              
              time, gravitational-sweep sedimentation velocity analysis,                     
              including the integration of graphics-based data interpretation                
              software, 2) development of methods for the analysis of                        
              associations between molecules which are heterogeneous with                    
              respect to buoyant mass, and 3) adapting the real-time                         
              interference optical system to the XL-An ultracentrifuge.  The                 
              ultimate goal is to provide the scientific community with a                    
              modern, fully-automated instrument and software capable of                     
              complete hydrodynamic and thermodynamic analyses.
