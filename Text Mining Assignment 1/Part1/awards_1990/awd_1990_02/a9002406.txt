Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                            
              Causative and Restructuring constructions have played a central                
              role in Romance linguistics.  These constructions hold a special               
              interest because they seem to behave in some respects like                     
              complex sentences (biclauses) and in other respects like simple                
              sentences (monoclauses).  This dual behavior has proved difficult              
              for current syntactic theory to account for in a principled                    
              fashion.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              The claim explored here is that the biclausal properties of                    
              Causative and Restructuring constructions can be accounted for                 
              within a purely monoclausal analysis-that is, an analysis that                 
              treats these constructions purely as simple sentences.  This                   
              dissertation project develops such an approach for Spanish.                    
              Among the analytic issues addressed are: the interaction of                    
              Restructuring with passive, the interaction of Causative with                  
              reflexives; and the syntax of Restructuring constructions formed               
              from psychological verbs.  Because many of the revelant facts                  
              have not yet been documented, this project constitutes a                       
              contribution to the description of Spanish syntax as well as to                
              the analysis of a theoretically recalcitrant construction.
