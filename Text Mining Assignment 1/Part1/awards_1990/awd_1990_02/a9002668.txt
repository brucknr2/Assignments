Abstract    :
              Partial support is to be provided for a symposium: "Fluid                      
              Mechanics of Stirring and Mixing," and a workshop to                           
              immediately precede the symposium: "Transport Enhancement by                   
              Chaotic Advection."  The location is the University of                         
              California at San Diego, and the time is August 18 through 24,                 
              1990 for the combined activity.  A selected group of symposium                 
              participants is to address special issues in transport                         
              enhancement at the workshop.  The symposium is also sponsored                  
              by the International Union of Theoretical and Applied                          
              Mechanics.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              Focus is to be on the possibility of designing de-stabilizing                  
              configurations and strategies for the beneficial utilization                   
              of chaotic fluid motions for enhanced transport of heat and                    
              mass, extending even to slow viscous flows.
