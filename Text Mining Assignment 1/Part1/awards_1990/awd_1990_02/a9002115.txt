Abstract    :
              The PIs are developing a radio scanner/recorder (SRS) which will               
              aid biologists in their field tracking of radio-tagged animals.                
              RSR monitors radio frequencies of animals and records their                    
              presence or absence.  Currently, data are retrieved from RSR by                
              attaching a laptop computer; the PIs developing a command telemetry            
              module (CTM) which will allow remote retrieval of data.                        
                                                                                             
              The prototype has been tested successfully for 14 months along the             
              Dolores River in southwestern Colorado, the site of recent                     
              reintroductions of 18 radio-tagged river otters and 20 desert                  
              bighorn sheep.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              Funds are requested for the development and testing of the CTM and             
              for the development of the printed circuit board for the RSR and               
              CTM.  Funds are also requested for components and assembly of a                
              network of instruments in order to test the system.
