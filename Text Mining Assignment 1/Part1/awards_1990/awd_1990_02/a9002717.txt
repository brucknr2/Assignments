Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research program is part of the                                           
              initiative to collect perishable data                                          
              resulting from the 17 October 1989 Northern                                    
              California (Loma Prieta) earthquake.                                           
                                                                                             
              The objective is to collect data on the                                        
              performance of underground natural gas                                         
              distribution systems.  These data include, as                                  
              a minimum, information on earthquake damage                                    
              to natural gas facilities, data on the type                                    
              and extent of repairs to natural gas systems,                                  
              documentation of emergency response and                                        
              recovery efforts, data on the number of                                        
              natural gas-related fires associated with the                                  
              earthquake, and information on areas of                                        
              severe ground displacement or settlement.                                      
                                                                                             
              Dr. Eguchi was responsible for collecting                                      
              preliminary information on natural gas                                         
              systems for the Earthquake Engineering                                         
              Research Institute reconnaissance effort for                                   
              the Loma Prieta earthquake.
