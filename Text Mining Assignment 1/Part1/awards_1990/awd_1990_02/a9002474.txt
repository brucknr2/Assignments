Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal is to make nutrient measurements (phosphate,                     
              nitrate, silicate) on the World Ocean Circulation Experiment                   
              (WOCE) cruises in the Pacific along longitudes 88 and 150 west.                
              The nutrient data are used along with other tracer data to                     
              describe the ocean circulation and in models of the                            
              circulation, one of the principal objectives of WOCE.
