Abstract    :
                   For many sessile marine invertebrates, the larval stage is                
              the most important mode of dispersal, and larval recruitment can               
              directly affect the growth, survival and structure of                          
              populations.  However, the nature and dynamics of larval                       
              dispersal, and thus gene flow, have been difficult to                          
              characterize.  The recent development of new and rapidly applied               
              molecular techniques may make it possible to assess dispersal by               
              examining the genetic "relatedness" of populations.  The PI                    
              proposes to learn and adapt molecular genetic techniques for the               
              study of coral population genetics.  The phylogenetic diversity                
              and population structure, over large and small geographic scales,              
              of the widely distributed brooding coral Acropora palifera will                
              determined.  Phylogeographic genotypes, along the length of the                
              Great Barrier Reef, will be characterized by contrasting                       
              restriction endonuclease patterns of small and large subunit                   
              ribosomal DNAs in this coral with closely and distantly related                
              corals.  The relatedness of colonies from reefs in the same                    
              geographic area will also be evaluated to assess the nature of                 
              local gene flow by restriction fragment length polymorphism                    
              analysis of mitochondrial DNA and DNA fingerprinting.
