Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Gas Chromatograph and Mass Spectrometer (GC/MS) system                     
              separates mixtures of volatile compounds and identifies the                    
              masses of each separated component.  The GC/MS is essential                    
              when there is a need to quantify soluble compounds found in                    
              dilute solutions.  The GC/MS is useful in areas such as                        
              chemical synthesis, kinetics and structural analysis.                          
                                                                                             
              This award from the Chemistry Instrumentation Program to the                   
              Department of Chemistry at University of Utah will help acquire                
              a GC/MS system.  The acquisition will enhance the ability of                   
              the Department to educate students and will enhance chemical                   
              research in the following areas:
