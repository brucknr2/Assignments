Abstract    :
                   Professor Wermer plans to generalize his work with H.                     
              Alexander on the polynomial hull of a convex set in complex n-                 
              dimensional space lying over the unit circle.  Natural                         
              generalizations occur when the circle is replaced by the unit                  
              sphere in complex 2-space or by the boundary of a multiply                     
              connected domain.                                                              
                   The area of application of these ideas is the theory of                   
              analytic functions of several complex variables.  An analytic                  
              function is one which is differentiable in the sense of                        
              elementary calculus but where the variable is a complex number.                
              The imposition of the requirement of differentiability leads to a              
              large but remarkable class of functions whose properties are                   
              still poorly understood in higher dimensions.  Professor Wermer                
              will investigate some of these properties.
