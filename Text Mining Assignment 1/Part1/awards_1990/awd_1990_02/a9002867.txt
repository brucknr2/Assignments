Abstract    :
              This is an award to provide partial support for a                              
              comprehensive study of issues in waste management that                         
              impact on the environmental quality of the urban coastal                       
              waters of the United States.  Issues to be addressed by                        
              the Water Science Technology Board of the National                             
              Research Council in this study, include the effects on                         
              coastal water quality produced both by point discharges of                     
              wastes and pollutants from diffuse, non-point sources.                         
              Effects to be considered include biostimulation of                             
              nuisance organisms and aquatic plants, the excessive                           
              growth and presence of which degrades coastal water                            
              quality and factors that directly impact on environmental                      
              quality and public health.  Additional support for this                        
              project is expected from the U.S. Environmental Protection                     
              Agency, state and local governmental agencies, and from                        
              the National Academy of Engineering.                                           
                                                                                             
              This project is expected to provide a basis for                                
              determining research needed for more appropriate                               
              utilization of coastal waters in management of waste                           
              discharges.  This is likely to include a search for                            
              innovative processes and systems to prepare wastes for                         
              ocean placement; better models of diffusion, dispersion                        
              and pollutant interactions as they are affected by                             
              physical, chemical and biological processes to determine                       
              their environmental effects; for determining the placement                     
              of pollution abatement facilities and their engineering                        
              design; and engineering systems for response to normal and                     
              accidental discharge of pollutants from marine vessels.
