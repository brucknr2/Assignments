Abstract    :
              The theme of this Conference "Hunting and Gathering Societies, Changing        
              Peoples, Changing Theories" will identify the emerging awareness of            
              political, social, and economic issues affecting Native peoples and the        
              role that indigenous people play in future hunter - gatherer research.         
              Internationally recognized experts will participate in this Conference         
              and participate in presentations of 80 papers and a series of symposia.        
              Topics include health, resource utilization, ethnoarchaeology,                 
              education, language and land use issues.  Approximately one-third of           
              the papers will address northern societies, with representatives of all        
              Arctic countries participating.  Agency funding of this Conference             
              directly supports the intent of the Arctic Research and Policy Act of          
              1984 and provides the opportunity for the National Science Foundation          
              to develop the objectives of its recently approved Arctic Social               
              Science Research Program.
