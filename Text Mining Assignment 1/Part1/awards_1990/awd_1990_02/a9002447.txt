Abstract    :
                   Theoretical understanding and development of realistic                    
              models for the various physical processes that occur are required              
              to understand how particles in the outer regions of the                        
              magnetosphere become energized and make their way into the polar               
              regions to produce the aurora.  This project is a continuation of              
              theoretical and model development research to further study the                
              chaotic properties of various magnetotail models and the                       
              application of these models to tail energization processes.  The               
              project is described in four main areas of research pertinent to               
              the role of stochastic particle orbits in magnetotail dynamics                 
              and the correct time scale for collisionless resistivity.  These               
              include studies of the irreversible behavior of current sheets                 
              and neutral line fields, the stochasticity of particle orbits,                 
              the response of ensembles of charged particles, diffusion                      
              coefficients and their dependence on model parameters,  all                    
              directed towards understanding the evolution of particle                       
              distributions from the plasma sheet boundary layer to the central              
              plasma sheet.    ***//
