Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will work on two major problems                
              in the area of nonparametric regression:  multivariate smoothing               
              and variance function estimation.  For the smoothing of                        
              surfaces, without any restrictions like additivity of the                      
              function or other assumptions to reduce dimensionality, an                     
              approach based on mixtures between an orthogonal series method                 
              using ultraspherical expansions and kernel estimators is to be                 
              developed.  The main problems to be analyzed are the choice of                 
              bandwidths, boundary effects and their treatment, associated                   
              questions of uniform convergence, the estimation of isoklines                  
              and the development of fast and efficient algorithms.  In his                  
              work on nonparametric variance function estimation he will                     
              develop methods for constructing confidence and prediction                     
              intervals of the variance.                                                     
                   The nonparametric analysis of curve data has found                        
              considerable interest among statisticians facing applied                       
              problems from longitudinal biomedical studies as well as                       
              geophysical and environmental spatial data.  The principal                     
              investigator will work on two specific problems in this area:                  
              surface fitting and variance function estimation.
