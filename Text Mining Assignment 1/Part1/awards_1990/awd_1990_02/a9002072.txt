Abstract    :
                   A central question in the foundations of mathematics is:                  
              Which set existence axioms are needed in order to prove specific               
              theorems of ordinary mathematics?  Here "ordinary mathematics"                 
              refers to the parts of mathematics which are not overtly set                   
              theoretical.  For instance "ordinary mathematics" includes                     
              subjects such as geometry, differential equations, real and                    
              complex analysis, countable algebra, countable combinatorics, and              
              the topology of complete separable metric spaces.  On the other                
              hand, "ordinary mathematics" does not include topics such as                   
              general topology and uncountable cardinal arithmetic.                          
                   It has been found that the language of second order                       
              arithmetic is an appropriate context for the study of the above                
              question.  (This is because "ordinary mathematics" is to a large               
              extent identifiable with countable and separable mathematics.)                 
              Moreover, a great many key theorems of ordinary mathematics, when              
              formalized as sentences of second order arithmetic, turn out to                
              be equivalent to the set existence axioms which are needed to                  
              prove them.  (The equivalent is proved over a weak base theory.)               
              Surprisingly, the number of inequivalent set existence axioms                  
              which arise in this way is rather small.  This is the theme of                 
              Reverse Mathematics, which has been developed by Simpson and                   
              others and will be further developed under the current project.
