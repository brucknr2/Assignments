Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Body growth depends on a hormonal stimulus for growth and adequate             
              quality and quantity of nutrients.  When nutrients are limiting, growth        
              is stunted.  Upon removal of nutritional restraint, catch-up growth            
              occurs.  This project attempts to elucidate how nutrition contols              
              growth in an animal model in which spontaneous running stimulates              
              growth of lean body mass and skeleton.  To assess how exercise affects         
              hormones of growth, and in conjunction with nutrients, stimulates              
              growth, measurements will be taken of gene activation for synthesis of         
              hormones of growth and of tissue proteins.  This study will contribute         
              to the understanding of the mechanism of growth and of the nature of           
              the stimulatory effects of exercise and food energy on growth.  The            
              results may provide insights for treatment of children or juvenile             
              animals in whom dietary restriction produces the stunting of growth.
