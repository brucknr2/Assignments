Abstract    :
              This grant will enable the National Action Council for minorities              
              in Engineering (NACME) to develop proposals for four major                     
              projects critical to the effort to broaden minority participation              
              in engineering.  These four projects are: (1) development of a set             
              of evaluation  instruments for assessing precollege program                    
              components and their impact on  student progress; (2) development              
              of workshops for engineering deans and faculty, focused on                     
              managing cultural diversity in the university environment; (3)                 
              development of a research agenda to study minority student                     
              attrition, based on an analysis of existing NACME data on                      
              dropouts; and (4) development of a community college articulation              
              program proposal, targeted at minority students in high schools                
              and two-year institutions.
