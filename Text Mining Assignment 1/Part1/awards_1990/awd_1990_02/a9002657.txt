Abstract    :
                   Dr. Wright will be studying conditions which imply that                   
              certain contractible manifolds of dimensions greater than or                   
              equal to three cannot be non-trivial covering spaces.  A very                  
              beautiful three-dimensional result of J. Robert Myers (Oklahoma                
              State University) shows that genus one Whitehead manifolds cannot              
              non-trivially cover any 3-manifold.  Dr. Wright's objectives are               
              to find conditions which can be easily checked which show that an              
              open contractible n-manifold cannot be a covering space of any                 
              other manifold.  These conditions will show that Whitehead                     
              manifolds (as defined by Myers) of arbitrary genus cannot be non-              
              trivial covering spaces, that n-dimensional generalizations of                 
              the Whitehead manifolds cannot be non-trivial covering spaces,                 
              and that the interior of the Mazur contractible 4-manifold cannot              
              be a non-trivial covering space.  In fact, Dr. Wright expects his              
              new approach to produce a significant understanding of which                   
              contractible open manifolds of all dimensions can be covering                  
              spaces.
