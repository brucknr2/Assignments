Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal is to make hydrographic measurements on the                      
              first leg of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) cruise              
              in the southeastern Pacific on longitude 88 west.  The data are                
              used to identify describe ocean processes in this region, an very              
              interesting one due to the complex vertical circulation that                   
              occurs there.  These measurements and related tracer observations              
              will form the basis for the ocean circulation description which                
              is an objective of WOCE.
