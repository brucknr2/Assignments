Abstract    :
              This award supports a study to develop an optimal telescope                    
              design for a new all-sky survey at 2.2 micrometers.  The major                 
              scientific goals of the survey are to study the large scale                    
              distribution of galaxies and the large scale distribution of                   
              stars within our Galaxy, without the interference of galactic                  
              dust obscuration.  The survey would cover the entire sky at least              
              twice, with sensitivity sufficient to detect point sources with K              
              magnitude brighter than 14; the data would begin to become                     
              publicly available within 1 year after survey operations end.                  
              The baseline system calls for a special-purpose 1-m telescope and              
              256 X 256 array detectors.                                                     
                                                                                             
              The enormous increase in sensitivity of the proposed survey                    
              compared to previous surveys makes its outcome broadly relevant                
              to many disciplines.  This study will lead to a preferred                      
              approach for a telescope design, as well as realistic estimate of              
              the cost and schedule required to build it.
