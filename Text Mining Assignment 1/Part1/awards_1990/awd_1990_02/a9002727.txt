              Conference on Information Technology.  This Conference in                      
              cooperation with the Associations for Computing Machinery                      
              (ACM), will be held in Jerusalem, Israel from October 22 to                    
              25, 1990.  The JCIT, held periodically since 1971, is a major                  
              international conference.  It attracts a broad audience of                     
              computer scientist, engineers, practitioners, users and                        
              managers.  The Conference is sponsored by the Information                      
              Processing Association of Israel and the IEEE Computer Society                 
              Brenabin Israel.                                                               
                   Like its four predecessors in 1971, 1974, 1978 and 1984,                  
              the 5th JCIT will cover a broad range of topics with emphasis                  
              on the technologies of the 90's.  The goals of the JCIT are to                 
              provide a broad-based forum for the presentation of                            
              achievements and innovative ideas in the various areas of                      
              information technology.                                                        
                   The conference provides an interdisciplinary environment                  
              for computer scientists, engineers, practitioners, users and                   
              managers to exchange views and ideas, and to discuss their                     
              likely impact on information systems of the next decade.                       
              Participants also have the opportunity to become acquainted                    
              with the achievements of Israel as a fast developing country in                
              the computer and related fields and to meet colleagues in                      
              Israel.  To this end, JCIT-5 will be held in conjunction with                  
              the 25th National Conference of the Israeli Systems Analyst                    
              Association.  The Conference will also display new trends in                   
              information technology by means of an extensive exhibit of                     
              computer hardware and software products.                                       
                   More than 40 countries have been represented at the                       
              previous conferences and an even larger participation is                       
              expected at JCIT-5.  An attendance of over 3,000 from Israel                   
              and 600 from abroad is anticipated.
