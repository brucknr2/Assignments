Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will conduct research in two                   
              areas of probability theory:  coupling and gradient estimates,                 
              conditional Brownian motion.  One goal of the first area is to                 
              give a new probabilistic approach to partial differential                      
              theory.  The principal investigator will use coupling arguments                
              to compare two or more stochastic averages for processes with                  
              differing initial distributions.  He will use tools from                       
              differential geometry.  The second area involves answering                     
              question in potential theory using probabilistic arguments.
