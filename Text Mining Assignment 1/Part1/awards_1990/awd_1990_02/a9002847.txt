Abstract    :
                   This research will focus on topics in statistical theory                  
              and will be aimed at developing procedures in the areas of                     
              linear errors-in-variables regression models and goodness of                   
              fit procedures.                                                                
                   The project is in the general area of statistics and                      
              probability.  Errors-in-variables regression models describe                   
              relationships among variables when both the explanatory and                    
              response variables are subject to random error.  Emphasis in                   
              this research will be placed on the role of reliability of                     
              measurements in determining the performance of                                 
              errors-in-variables regression techniques.  Goodness of fit                    
              procedures assess the adequacy of distributional assumptions or                
              of structural models.  This research will involve a study of                   
              general multinomial-based procedures for testing fit in                        
              categorical data.
