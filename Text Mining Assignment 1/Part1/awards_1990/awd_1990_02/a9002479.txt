Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal is to make chloroflouromethane (CFC)                             
              measurements on the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE)                  
              cruises in the southeastern Pacific on longitudes 88 and 150                   
              west.  The CFC tracers data are used to identify upper ocean                   
              formation processes, and are important in the assessment of                    
              ventilation and subduction mechanisms.  These measurements and                 
              related tracer observations, along with hydrographic measurements              
              will form the basis for the ocean circulation description which                
              is an objective of WOCE.
