Abstract    :
              Dr. Kevin Williams has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research                    
              Fellowship in Chemistry.  Dr. Williams' doctoral degree was                    
              from the University of Pittsburgh under the supervision of                     
              Professor Julius Rebek.  Dr. Williams intends to continue                      
              research at Harvard University under the sponsorship of                        
              Professor George Whitesides.  Dr. Williams' area of                            
              postdoctoral research will be the synthesis of molecules                       
              capable of molecular recognition and their application to                      
              chemical synthesis. The synthesis of the nucleoside antibiotic,                
              tunicamycin, will be developed using a combination of enzymatic                
              and chemical synthetic approaches.                                             
                                                                                             
              The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as                 
              an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the                   
              knowledge and experience of new Ph.D's and attract them into                   
              meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and                       
              teaching.
