Abstract    :
                   The objective of this research is the determination of the                
              rate of collisional growth of ice hydrometeors.  This will be                  
              accomplished using both laboratory experiments and various                     
              theoretical calculations.  The former will exploit an existing                 
              acoustic device (at MIT) designed to suspend selected crystals                 
              using standing sound waves.  This device will be used to                       
              determine the collision efficiency between ice particles and                   
              water-ice particles.  Also, electric charge separation will be                 
              measured when charged drops and ice crystals collide.  Finally,                
              the calculation of three dimensional unsteady fields of motion in              
              the vicinity of various hydrometers will be used to interpret                  
              the experimental results.  //
