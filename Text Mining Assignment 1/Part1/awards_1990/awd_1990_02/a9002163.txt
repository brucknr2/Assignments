Abstract    :
              This is an award to support for Phase II of a project                          
              initiated under NSF Grant No. 88-60919 under conditions                        
              outlined in the Program Solicitation for Small Business                        
              Innovation Research, NSF 88-8.  The work under Phase I                         
              resulted in demonstration of the feasibility of an                             
              innovative concept using microbes to biologically degrade                      
              volatile halogenated aliphatic organic contaminants of                         
              soil.  The process achieved as much as 99.9 percent                            
              destruction of trichloroethylene.  In Phase II, the scope                      
              of the work will be narrowed to a liquid-phase reactor                         
              that is of sufficiently large scale to facilitate full-                        
              scale design and construction of prototype bioreactors and                     
              determine the commercial applicability of the process by                       
              determining its efficiency and economic feasibility.                           
                                                                                             
              The contamination of ground and surface waters by organic                      
              compounds that are the target of this research is a matter                     
              of great National concern.  It is imperative that                              
              technologies be developed that are more efficiently                            
              responsive to decontamination of soil.1  Results of this                       
              project are expected to be useful in this respect.
