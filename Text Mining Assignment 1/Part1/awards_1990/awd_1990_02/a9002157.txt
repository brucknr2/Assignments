Abstract    :
                   This project is concerned with problems in commutative                    
              algebra and algebraic geometry. The principal investigator will                
              work on the canonical element conjecture of Hochster and                       
              related problems. He will also consider the positivity part of                 
              Serre's conjecture on intersection multiplicity of modules.                    
                   This research is on the interface of algebraic geometry                   
              and commutative algebra. This is currently a very active area                  
              in which an associated commutative algebra is used to obtain                   
              refined knowlege about the underlying geometric object.
