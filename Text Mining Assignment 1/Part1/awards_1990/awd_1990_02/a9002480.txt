Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal is to make helium and tritiummeasurements on                     
              the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) cruises in the                   
              southeastern Pacific on longitudes 88 and 150 west.  These                     
              tracers data are used to identify upper ocean formation                        
              processes, and are important in the assessment of ventilation and              
              subduction mechanisms.  These measurements and related tracer                  
              observations, along with hydrographic measurements will form the               
              basis for the ocean circulation descriptions and models which are              
              the principal objectives of WOCE.
