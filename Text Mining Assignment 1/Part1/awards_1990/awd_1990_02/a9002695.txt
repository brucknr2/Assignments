Abstract    :
                   Dr. Vilonen intends to continue his work on perverse                      
              sheaves, D-modules and their applications to representation                    
              theory.  There are projects in three different areas.                          
                   The first area of research is on problems relating to the                 
              micro-local structure of perverse sheaves, Riemann-Hilbert                     
              correspondence for irregular D-modules (and E-modules) and a                   
              direct construction of mixed perverse sheaves.                                 
                   The second area of research is on the Langlands conjecture.               
              Here the investigator intends to work on a geometric form of the               
              Langlands conjecture.  This geometric formulation implies the                  
              Langlands conjecture for function fields.                                      
                   The third area of research is on representation theory of                 
              Lie groups.  The goal here is to understand explicitly the                     
              structure of (g,K)-modules.                                                    
                   These labors are all part of a large effort involving                     
              numerous mathematicians to perfect algebraic and analytic tools                
              for relating geometry of spaces to properties of structures which              
              "live" on these spaces.
