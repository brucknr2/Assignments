Abstract    :
                   Professor Thomas will conduct research in the area of non-                
              commutative Banach algebras.  His main goal is to prove a version              
              of the Singer-Wermer conjecture generalizing his previous result               
              proved in the commutative case.  In addition he will study the                 
              structure theory of radicals in Banach algebras.                               
                   Banach algebras consist of abstract objects which can be                  
              added and multiplied, but the exact form of the multiplication                 
              rule is purposely left unspecified so that the results obtained                
              apply to very many situations.  Concrete examples of Banach                    
              algebras are plentiful, and this research will help elucidate                  
              their structure.
