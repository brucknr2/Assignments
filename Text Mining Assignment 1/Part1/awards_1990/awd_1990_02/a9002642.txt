Abstract    :
                   This research will focus on harmonic analysis.  The                       
              emphasis will be on the orbit method of C(star)-algebras,                      
              including applications of these algebras to dynamical systems, to              
              topology, and to the geometry of manifolds.  One project is to                 
              develop new results on orbital integral formulas, symmetric                    
              spaces, and multiplicity questions in dynamical systems.  The                  
              other project is a study of equivariant index theory, operator                 
              algebra invariants, and representations of discrete groups.                    
                   This research is in the general subarea of modern analysis                
              which examines the representation theory of algebras of                        
              functions.
