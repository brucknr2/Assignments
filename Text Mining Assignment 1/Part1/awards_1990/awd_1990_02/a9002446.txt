Abstract    :
              This project in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program of                
              the Chemistry Division studies the fundamentals of solvation,                  
              the interaction of additives with liquids.  Solvation                          
              properties affect reaction rates and the course of reactions.                  
              When two or more solvents interact, separation of components is                
              based on competitive solvation properties.  Prof. Carr has been                
              developing general descriptions of solvation, and this work                    
              extends his earlier explorations.                                              
                                                                                             
              Solvation properties are organized based on Kamlet-Taft scales                 
              of dipolarity, hydrogen bond acidity, and basicity.  Gas and                   
              liquid chromatography will be used to measure solvation                        
              parameters, and then new chromatography columns will be                        
              evaluated based on knowledge of the previously measured                        
              parameters.  Extension to characterization of reversed phase                   
              liquid chromatography will be made.  Free energy scales for                    
              solvation as a function of acidity and basicity parameters will                
              be established.
