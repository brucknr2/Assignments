Abstract    :
              Three areas of investigation are contemplated.  Dr. Bruice                     
              will continue model work on the reactions catalyzed by                         
              organomercurial and mercuric reductase.  In the former he has                  
              shown that the protonolysis rate is accelerated by bis-                        
              thiol ligation of the substrate mercury, and the generality of                 
              this reaction will now be explored.  For the reductase,                        
              the one-electron and two-electron reduction potentials for                     
              various liganded mercuric ions will be determined in order to                  
              resolve the thermodynamics of the system.  Studies will be                     
              initiated in the area of RNA self-splicing  and self                           
              cleavage.  The plausible role of metal ions as transition                      
              state stabilizers in the general base catalyzed displacement                   
              reactions of ribose 2' and 3' hydroxyl groups on                               
              phosphodiester linkages will be probed by the synthesis of                     
              suitable dinucleotide models.  The relationships of structure                  
              to hammerhead self cleavage will be determined by molecular                    
              dynamics and energy minimization methods.  A collaboration                     
              will be initiated with Drs. Lerner and Benkovic to produce                     
              porphyrin containing monoclonal antibodies to mimic heme                       
              dependent redox enzymes of another new direction.
