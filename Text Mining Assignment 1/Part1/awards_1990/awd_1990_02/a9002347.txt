Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will study the vertex and edge                 
              connectivity of the giant component of a randomly evolving graph.              
              One aspect of an Erdos-Renyi randomly evolving graph is a sudden               
              appearance of the giant component, right after the moment when                 
              the average vertex degree becomes equal to 1.  This research will              
              lead to a better understanding of the likely behavior of such                  
              important extremal characteristics of the random graph as the                  
              chromatic number, the independence number and the matching                     
              number.  The investigator will also study the giant component                  
              phenomenon in two other models, bipartite random graph and a                   
              Flory-Stockmayer-Whittle model of polymerization process.                      
              Finally, the investigator will work on fast probabilistic                      
              algorithms for Hamilton circuits and matchings.
