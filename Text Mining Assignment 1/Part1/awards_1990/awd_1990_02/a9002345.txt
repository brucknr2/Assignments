Abstract    :
              This award supports the analysis and intepretation of                          
              glaciological data, primarily from Greenland and Alaska.  The                  
              project will consist of three parts:                                           
                                                                                             
              1)  The analysis of glacier facies as a classification for all                 
              glaciers.  It will focus on the importance of meltwater                        
              percolating and freezing within snow to both the heat and mass                 
              balance of glaciers and the extent to which facies boundaries can              
              be determined from satellites and aircraft.                                    
                                                                                             
              2)  A synthesis of existing knowledge about snow accumulation on               
              the Greenland Ice Sheet based on data from pit studies, snow and               
              ice cores, and meteorological stations.  This will demonstrate                 
              the extent of orographic control on the distribution of snow                   
              accumulation.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              3)  An analysis of snow pit and core data from the summit of Mt.               
              Wrangell, Alaska, obtained between 1961 and 1989 to define the                 
              snow stratigraphy's relation to avaialable climatological data.
