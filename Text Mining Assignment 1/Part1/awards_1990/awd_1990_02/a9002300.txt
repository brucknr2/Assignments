Abstract    :
              The Program in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology of the                       
              Department of Chemistry and the Institute of Marine Science of                 
              the School of Fisheries and Ocean Sciences will purchase a Jasco               
              Spectropolarimeter with data collection/manipulation system.                   
              This instrument will be initially used in five research programs:              
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
                        1. Role of pigments and protein in thylakoid membrane                
                           biogenesis.                                                       
                        2. Analysis of synthetic amyloid peptides.                           
                        3. Structural resolution of plant anti-herbivore                     
                           secondary metabolites.                                            
                        4. Structural/functional relationships of protein upon               
                           gelation.                                                         
                        5. Structure/activity relationship in a bacterial                    
                           decardoxylase.                                                    
                                                                                             
              Undergraduate students participate in the above research programs              
              during the academic year and during summer as part of the REU                  
              program.  Some of the current projects involving undergraduates                
              are:                                                                           
                                                                                             
                        1. Analysis of protein synthesis in the brains of                    
                           salmon during smoltification.                                     
                        2. Heavy metal toxicity effects on photosynthetic                    
                           membranes at the level of gene expression.                        
                        3. Effect of plant secondary metabolites from forest                 
                           floor litter on rates of microbial nitrification.                 
                        4. Structure a diterpene isolated from Colophospermum                
                           mophane.                                                          
                                                                                             
              The spectropolarimeter will also be used in laboratory portion of              
              undergraduate courses.  This instrument will be a significant                  
              addition of the University's instrumentation capabilities.  Since              
              this will be the only spectropolarimeter available in the state,               
              it will function as a regional instrument for users at other                   
              state campuses as well as at other University sponsored research               
              institutes.
