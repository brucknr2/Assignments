Abstract    :
                   Professor Hughes will apply work of Ricci and Stein on                    
              oscillatory integrals to singular perturbation problems arising                
              in quantum mechanics.  In addition Hughes will consider the                    
              solution of the time dependent Schroedinger equation with                      
              singular time dependent interactions.  A unifying theme will be                
              the use of the interaction representation for solutions of the                 
              Schroedinger equation.                                                         
                   This work involves the mathematics of quantum mechanics.                  
              Professor Hughes will apply new mathematical techniques to                     
              understand the behavior of interacting quantum mechanical                      
              particles.
