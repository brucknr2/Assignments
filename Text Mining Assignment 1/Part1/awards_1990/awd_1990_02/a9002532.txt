Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Multiple-interaction molecular dynamics simulation techniques                  
              will be used to study:  (1) nonlinear effects in ion-surface                   
              collisions, (2) cluster emission and formation in sputtering, (3)              
              problems related to surface sticking and film growth, (4)                      
              isotopic effects in sputtering from layered targets, and (5)                   
              other basic properties of collision cascades induced by low                    
              energy ions.  This work will be carried out at California State                
              University, Fullerton (a predominantly undergraduate                           
              institution), and in collaboration with the Basic and Applied                  
              Science Group at Caltech and the Surface Physics Group at the                  
              National Institute of Standards and Technology.  Our aims are                  
              two-fold.  Namely, to extend the fundamental understanding of                  
              ion-surface collision phenomena, and to guide future experimental              
              work in this area.
