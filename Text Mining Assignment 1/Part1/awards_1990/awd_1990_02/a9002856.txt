Abstract    :
                   A series of topics in probability and statistics will be                  
              studied which are unified by the geometric techniques that are                 
              employed. Contact sets will be used to study questions of                      
              robustness in Bayesian estimation. The question of reconstructing              
              a subset from finitely many central projections, knowing that it               
              comes from a given population, will be examined. The results                   
              will be applied to problems in tomography. A further goal is a                 
              better understanding of the structure of finite dimensional                    
              moment spaces induced by the class of all measures on a given                  
              polyhedral region.  Further aims are generalized confidence                    
              intervals subject to a preassigned smoothness condition and                    
              probability densities having given moments and possessing a                    
              maximal degree of smoothness. A new minimal entropy method will                
              be studied to achieve a partition of data into relatively                      
              homogeneous blocks or clusters.
