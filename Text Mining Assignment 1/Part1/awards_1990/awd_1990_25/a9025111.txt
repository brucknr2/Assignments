Abstract    :
                      This project is concerned with centralizer algebras,                   
              insertion schemes, stability and constructions of graded Lie                   
              algebras.  The principal investigator will study tensor products of            
              representations of complex simple Lie algebras and the behavior of             
              spinor representations as the rank of the orthogonal Lie algebra               
              goes to infinity.  In addition, she will study constructions of                
              graded Lie algebras as a means of systematically exploring simple              
              Lie algebras of small characteristic and of determining root                   
              multiplicities for GIM and Kac-Moody algebras.                                 
                     This project is on the interface of physics, combinatorics,             
              algebraic geometry and characteristic p algebra.  It involves                  
              constructive representation questions left hanging since the time              
              of Weyl and Brauer.  These questions are presently of great                    
              interest to combinatorialists and physicists.
