Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will support collaborative research in ecology                      
              between Dr. David Myrold, Oregon State University and Dr.                      
              Kerstin Huss-Danell, Department of Plant Physiology, University                
              of Umea, Sweden.                                                               
                                                                                             
              The project will examine two important questions concerning                    
              Alnus-Frankia symbiosis, namely the effect of several factors                  
              on the biomass and diversity of Frankia in the soil and the                    
              amount of fixed N released to the soil by nodulated Alnus. In                  
              particular, soil will be sampled from an established research                  
              site that has been treated by liming, NPK fertilization and                    
              the introduction of alder.  This soil will be assayed for                      
              Frankia biomass by plant bioassay and DNA probe methods. The                   
              results of these experiments will not only provide important                   
              new information in understanding Alnus-Frankia symbiosis, but                  
              will by extension provide new insight into actinorhizal                        
              plants in general.  These plants are ecologically important,                   
              because they can alter ecosystem level processes by rapidly                    
              altering the nitrogen content of the systems in which they                     
              occur.  They also have importance in forestry, land reclamation                
              and horticulture. This project will benefit from the compleme-                 
              ntary expertise of Dr. Myrold in microbiology and of Dr.                       
              Huss-Danell in plant physiology. Dr. Myrold will also be able                  
              to take advantage of a field site in Sweden which has been                     
              extensively studied and is exceptionally well suited to the                    
              proposed research.
