Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The use of forward genetics to study development has given us                  
              profound insights into how genes act to shape the body plan of a               
              multicellular organism as it develops from a fertilized egg. So                
              far, however, this approach has only been extremely successful                 
              with invertebrate organisms, particularly Drosophila. The goal of              
              the proposed research is to develop and apply genetic techniques               
              to identify genes that play critical roles in the early                        
              development of a vertebrate animal, the zebrafish, Brachydanio                 
              rerio. Dr. Hopkins plans to mutagenize fish and examine their                  
              progeny for developmentally interesting early mutants. She will                
              try to develop techniques for mutagenesis by DNA insertion so                  
              that mutated genes can be cloned easily, however, she will also                
              work towards, and will probably begin screens, using gamma ray or              
              chemical mutagenesis. The advantages of the zebrafish for genetic              
              analysis were recognized by Streisinger some years ago, but only               
              recently has the potential of the zebrafish for the genetic study              
              of early development begun to be widely recognized.
