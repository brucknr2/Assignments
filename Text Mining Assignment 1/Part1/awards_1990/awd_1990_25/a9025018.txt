Abstract    :
                   The proposed research is designed to test hypotheses about                
              the function of horns and to apply results to the conservation of              
              asocial megavertebrates, particularly in response to catastrophic              
              reductions due to poaching.  To delay the decline, a bold                      
              experiment is being attempted in Namibia where male and female                 
              black rhinos have been dehorned.  Unlike actions employed in                   
              other geographic regions, dehorning has been controversial for                 
              three principal reasons:  (1) while horns are re-grown, rates of               
              re-growth remain unknown making it impossible to know where horn               
              removal might be needed again; (2) because not all animals are                 
              dehorned, horned animals may have reproductive advantages; hence,              
              effects of removal on the breeding and genetic structure of the                
              population are unclear; and (3) the calves of hornless females                 
              may be more vulnerable to predation.  In the absence of                        
              information, horn function cannot be assessed.                                 
                   The proposed research addresses these issues by gathering                 
              data on horn growth and regrowth, comparing reproduction among                 
              rhinos varying in horn size, and examining the frequency of                    
              attacks by predators toward, and responses of, horned and                      
              hornless rhinos.  Two study sites will be used, one with horned                
              and hornless rhinos, and another with individuals all with intact              
              horns.  The research promises new insight into the effects of                  
              anatomical structures on life histories of animals in the wild,                
              and has significant potential for affecting management of this                 
              rare species.
