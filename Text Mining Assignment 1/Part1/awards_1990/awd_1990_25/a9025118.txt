Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The human auditory system is very important for spatial                        
              orientation.  Hearing is the only sense that can provide                       
              information about the position of remote events regardless of                  
              where the observer is currently facing.  The lateral location                  
              of the ears make the auditory system well situated to direct                   
              positional changes of the head and the eyes toward a target of                 
              interest.  Recent experiments have shown that the time required                
              to locate and identify a visual event is substantially improved                
              if auditory spatial information on the location of the event is                
              also available.                                                                
                                                                                             
              This research project considers the following issues: 1) What are              
              the factors underlying the improvement in visual search, for                   
              both horizontally and vertically distributed targets, when                     
              aural aids are available?  2) Does this auditory spatial                       
              advantage extend to visual search in depth, toward and away                    
              from the observer?  The results will have implications for any                 
              situation in which efficient visual scanning is critical and                   
              acoustic spatial information can be made available, such as                    
              visual arrays in cockpits or air traffic control systems,                      
              development of mobility aids for individuals with visually                     
              restricted visual fields, and pedestrian or industrial safety.
