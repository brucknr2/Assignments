Abstract    :
                   This project deals with questions in algebra                              
              concerning the theory of Azumaya algebras on a variety.  If                    
              X is a variety over an algebraically closed field k, the                       
              Azumaya X-algebras are parametrized up to Brauer equivalence                   
              by the Brauer group B(X).  The principal investigator will                     
              study B(X) using cohomological techniques from algebraic                       
              geometry.  Then he will apply these properties to gain                         
              information about the geometry of the variety X.                               
                   This research is in the general area of algebra and is                    
              an interesting combination of ring theory, number theory and                   
              algebraic geometry.  Given a surface it is possible to                         
              associate with it a coordinate ring and with this ring a                       
              group in an effort to determine the geometry of the surface.
