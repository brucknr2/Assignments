Abstract    :
              Integrated Optical Circuits (IOCs) currently perform                           
              several operations on optical signals, and the more                            
              important functions are:  switching or routing,                                
              amplitude and phase modulation, time delay and                                 
              detection.  In all cases, the structures are passive, and                      
              lossy, which in turn impinges on the system                                    
              performance.  Furthermore, couplers, interferometers                           
              and other components that make up these structures                             
              are long, up to several millimeters each.  The active                          
              guide structures to be used for the proposed Active                            
              Integrated Optical Circuits will have gain or                                  
              attenuation depending on the biasing condition, and                            
              thus loss is no longer an issue.  Since the proposed                           
              structures are not dependent on coupling lengths,                              
              these may be made in very compact form.                                        
              Furthermore, the guides are basically laser structures                         
              biased to transparency, gain or loss, and thus                                 
              integration with similar laser sources is feasible.                            
              Proposed structures in the form of Ys, Xs, and                                 
              crossbars may be used as switches, routing structures,                         
              and modulators, and these are to be investigated for                           
              switching speed, polarization dependence,                                      
              temperature, bandwidth, current loading, and noise                             
              contribution.  Several other optical integrated circuits                       
              are also possible with these active guides, but this one                       
              year exploratory research grant will confine itself to                         
              investigations of the above structures.
