Abstract    :
              This research will develop algorithms which estimate and control               
              the error in numerical approximations of initial/boundary-value                
              problems in nonlinear path-dependent continua.  The research will              
              focus on the development and implementation of adaptive finite-                
              element methods for the analysis of strain localization and failure            
              in viscoplastic solids.  Specific applications will be implemented             
              for the case of porous ductile solids under conditions which                   
              include the generation of new surfaces due to local material                   
              failure by void coalescence.  The development of such adaptive                 
              finite-element models could have a major impact on the numerical               
              simulation of many phenomena which include progressive failure                 
              through localization of plastic flow such as the ballistic impact,             
              the perforation and penetration of solids, crashworthiness, metal              
              forming and manufacturing processes.
