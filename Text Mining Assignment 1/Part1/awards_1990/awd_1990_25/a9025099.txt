Abstract    :
              This project is one component of an integrated oceanographic                   
              research program that will be carried out from a camp maintained               
              on the pack ice of the western Weddell Sea in the 1992 austral                 
              winter.  One of the major objectives of the research project is                
              to obtain the first representative hydrographic and tracer                     
              observations in this region, where deep and bottom water mass                  
              formation processes are active.  The specific objectives of this               
              project are to collect oxygen-18, helium isotope, and tritium                  
              samples at the camp itself and on several sections crossing the                
              Weddell Sea continental slope.  The observations will be used to               
              create in integrated chemical tracer data set which will be used               
              to model the formation rates and processes of Weddell Sea deep                 
              and bottom water.
