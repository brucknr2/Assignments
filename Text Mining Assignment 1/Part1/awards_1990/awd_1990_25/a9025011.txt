Abstract    :
              This is a workshop to identify the research needs in the                       
              area of power quality.  The topic is a special subset of                       
              electric power engineering.  The topic of Power quality                        
              refers to the ability of the power distribution system to                      
              satisfy loads with a sinusoidal bus voltage waveform at                        
              rated voltage and frequency.  Also included are studies                        
              of harmonics, momentary outages, impulses, pulse-                              
              modulated load currents, non-linear loads, power factor                        
              correction under distorted waveform conditions, and                            
              modelling power systems for the analysis of non-                               
              sinusoidal signals.  The objectives of the workshop are                        
              to identify the highest priorities in research in this area                    
              and to stimulate work in those areas.
