Abstract    :
              Ill. Inst. of Tech.                                                            
              The objectives of this proposal are the investigation of                       
              solids entrainment to the jet area in a fluidized bed, and the                 
              development of a multiphase model to explain and scale-up the                  
              results.  The experiments is simple, but important for                         
              understanding a phenomenon commonly encountered in fluidized                   
              bed systems.  Modeling is performed with simplifying                           
              assumption by retaining in the equations only the most                         
              significant effects.  Matching funds for personnel and                         
              materials will be provided by the Energy Center at IIT.                        
                                                                                             
              The proposed analysis of a fluidized bed with a central jet                    
              has relevance for numerous applications.  The fluidized beds                   
              with no jet is a limiting case of the present device.  It is                   
              expected that the proposed approach will provide a                             
              quantitative basis for better understanding and designing the                  
              fluidized bed systems.
