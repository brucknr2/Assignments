Abstract    :
              Three topics in constant testability (or C-testability) for                    
              homogeneous structures of combinational and sequential circuits is             
              being investigated. C-testability methods are being extended into              
              new areas including systems.  The first topic is cell decomposition            
              where an unrestricted, component level fault model is being                    
              analyzed.  Questions of dividing a cell into components that can               
              be tested, and of devising a hierarchal organization for the                   
              testing process are being investigated. Second is C-testability of             
              sequential arrays using checking and touring methods. Procedures               
              for testing sequential arrays using unique input-output sequences              
              are being examined. Third is concurrent C-testability for Built-               
              in-Self-Test (BIST).  Structures amenable to array implementation              
              in combinational and sequential cells are being explored to assess             
              latency time and hardware overhead.
