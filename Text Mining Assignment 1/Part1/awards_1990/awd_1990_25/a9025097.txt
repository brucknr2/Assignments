Abstract    :
              The aim of this study will be to derive large-scale, fully 3-                  
              dimensional descriptions of both the magnetic field and the                    
              distribution of plasma in the lower corona.  The model is to be                
              constrained by coronameter measurements of white light that has                
              been scattered by coronal electrons.  To model the large scale                 
              structure, which does not change substantially over a solar                    
              rotation, a magnetospheric model (Bogdan and Low, 1986) which                  
              describes both the coronal magnetic field and density                          
              distribution in terms of a set of multipole coefficients and                   
              other parameters, will be employed.  The underlying assumptions                
              of the model will be tested, and standard inversion techniques                 
              will be adopted to solve for model parameters which best fit the               
              data set.  The ultimate goal is to find a quantitative                         
              description for changes in the solar corona over time scales such              
              as the solar cycle.  The work will be developed  with emphasis                 
              on (a) further development of the inversion technique, (b)                     
              comparison with measurements of the photospheric magnetic field,               
              (c) extending the inversion to a larger data set.
