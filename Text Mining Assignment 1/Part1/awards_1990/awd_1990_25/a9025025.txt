Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research of Professor N. Hindman to               
              work in combinatorics.  He intends to investigate the algebraic                
              structure of the set of all ultrafilters on a discrete semigroup               
              and combinatorial applications of this structure.                              
                   The research is in the general area of combinatorics.                     
              Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods to study how                  
              discrete collections of objects can be organized.  And, so it is               
              extremely important to modern communications, for example the                  
              design of large networks as in telephone systems and the design of             
              algorithms in computer science.
