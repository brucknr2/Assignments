Abstract    :
                   This project will systematically examine the relationships                
              between fires in tropical environments and their corresponding                 
              stratigraphic signals, in the form of particulate carbon in                    
              sediments of lakes, bogs, and caves (charcoal stratigraphy).  The              
                                                                                             
              customary methods for determining charcoal content of sediments                
              will be compared for precision, accuracy, and speed with a new                 
              method being developed utilizing automated digital image                       
              analysis.  Sedimentary charcoal parameters (concentration,                     
              influx, type, practice size distribution) will be measured in                  
              about 200 modern sediment samples collected in previous projects               
                                                                                             
              from an array of sites ranging from 43 N to 25 S, including                    
              deserts, rainforests, tropical savannas, temperate forest,                     
              cultivated areas, and montane environments.  Charcoal parameters               
                                                                                             
              will be compared with ecological data on the sites (basin type                 
              and size vegetation, climate, and local/regional fire                          
              occurrence).  This information will be used to interpret fire                  
              histories derived from laminated sediment cores collected form                 
              Madagascar.  Kenya/Tanzania, and Puerto Rico.  Preliminary dating              
                                                                                             
              and other analyses indicate that these cores can be expected to                
                                                                                             
              yield detailed fire histories for the sites spanning several
