Abstract    :
                   The general area of research encompassed by this project                  
              relates to the theory of several complex variables and partial                 
              differential equations.  One question of particular concern is                 
              that of the uniqueness of continuation in Cauchy-Riemann                       
              manifolds.  Basically these studies involve questions of whether               
              or not a holomorphic function of several variables can be                      
              constant along various submanifolds of a domain without being                  
              constant everywhere.  A second aspect of the work will focus on                
              the properties of sets preserved under holomorphic mappings                    
              between spaces of different dimensions.  Much of what is                       
              intuitively obvious in the one dimensional case turns out to be                
              false in higher dimensional settings.
