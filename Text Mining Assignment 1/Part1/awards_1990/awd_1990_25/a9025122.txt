Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The goal of this research effort is to model complex diffusional               
              processes with simple, but rigorous equations.  These equations                
              have already been derived for single phase systems in terms of the             
              square root diffusivity.  Experimental studies are made using                  
              diffusion couples containing small concentration differences in                
              order to satisfy a constant diffusivity assumption.  A computer                
              program is being developed to predict concentration profiles in                
              diffusion couples that contain up to eight alloying elements.  This            
              research is important to high temperature processing techniques                
              such as pack cementation, oxidation and annealing.  Diffusion                  
              causes property degradation in high temperature materials systems              
              such as coated turbine blades and metal-matrix composites.  This               
              research should provide valuable predictive capabilities for these             
              and similar processes.
