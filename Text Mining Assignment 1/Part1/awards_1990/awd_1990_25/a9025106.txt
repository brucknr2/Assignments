Abstract    :
              This proposal aims to investigate how the optical properties of                
              liquid crystals are modified by external perturbation, in this case            
              by an ordinary laser beam.  One area to be explored involves the               
              study of laser-induced molecular reorientation and macroscopic                 
              structural transitions, highly nonlinear optical wave propagation,             
              and laser induced nonlinear dynamics in liquid crystals.  Another              
              area focuses on liquid crystal properties, such as those resulting             
              from surface or interface processes, that cannot be as easily                  
              probed by other techniques.
