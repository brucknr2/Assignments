Abstract    :
              Professor Miller is supported by the Experimental Physical                     
              Chemistry Program to investigate the spectroscopy of various                   
              transient chemical species.  Such chemical intermediates as                    
              reactive atoms, free radicals, and molecular ions often play                   
              critical roles in reactions in combustion, solvation, synthetic                
              processes, and the chemistry of the atmosphere.  Spectroscopic                 
              identification and characterization is important both for                      
              monitoring these intermediates and for understanding their                     
              structures and interactions.                                                   
                                                                                             
              Two facilities constructed under prior NSF support are used in                 
              this work.  One facility, dedicated to the study of ionic                      
              clusters, uses laser-induced fluorescence to probe cluster                     
              structure and time-of-flight mass spectrometry to determine the                
              number of atoms.  The second apparatus prepares neutral                        
              radicals in a pulsed supersonic jet for ultra-high resolution                  
              pulsed laser spectroscopy designed to reveal details of                        
              rotational structure.  Species under investigation range from                  
              small polyatomics to multi-ring aromatic radicals and include                  
              clusters containing ions or open-shell radicals.
