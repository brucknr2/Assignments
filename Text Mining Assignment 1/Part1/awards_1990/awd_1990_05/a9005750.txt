Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Dr. Cassidy will use this award, made through the Small Grants                 
              for Exploratory Research program, to experimentally test the                   
              hypothesis that certain minerals found in meteorites could have                
              grown metastably.  Laboratory equipment and facilities for these               
              studies are available at the Westinghouse Science and Technology               
              Center in Pittsburgh.                                                          
                                                                                             
              Diamonds and SiC grains have recently been identified in most                  
              classes of primitive stony meteorites.  These materials probably               
              condensed in the crystalline state from vapor.  They may not have              
              crystallized under equilibrium conditions, however.  The                       
              possibility of metastable crystal growth has been raised by the                
              discovery that crystalline diamond can be produced artificially                
              in a plasma at very low pressures and moderate temperatures.                   
              Other high temperature minerals occur in primitive meteorites                  
              and, by analogy, these may also have grown metastably.  Dr.                    
              Cassidy's research will explore the metastable growth of these                 
              minerals.  If the research is successful, certain assumptions                  
              about the condensation theory of cosmic dust grains will have to               
              be reexamined.
