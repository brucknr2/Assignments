Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project supports two cultural anthropologists studying ways               
              in which Protestant Pentecostalism and more traditional or                     
              Catholic forms of popular religion are involved in the creation                
              of new cultural models of gender, family, and definitions of                   
              personhood in southern Italy.  Popular religionists and                        
              Pentecostals are found in close interaction within the same                    
              families, kin networks, and neighborhoods.  The project will                   
              examine similarities and differences in these cultural models by               
              studying domestic relations, healing performances, conversion                  
              accounts and life histories, and in the house shrines.  Two                    
              principal investigators will conduct the research in two major                 
              urban centers of Sicily -- Palermo and Catania.  In each field                 
              site participant-observation will be supplemented by survey                    
              analysis and oral historical methods, comparing Pentecostal                    
              church members, non-Pentecostal kin of church members, former                  
              members (dropouts) of the Pentecostal churches, and in a group of              
              popular religionists without connections to Pentecostalism.                    
                                                                                             
              This research is important because popular religion is an                      
              important force in most of the world's cultures, and                           
              understanding the dynamics of the relation between newer and                   
              older forms of popular religion will help us understand how                    
              religions wax and wane in importance.
