Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal requests assistance from the National                            
              Science Foundation to establish a multiuser Hybridoma                          
              Research Laboratory at The University of Texas at San                          
              Antonio (UTSA).  The laboratory will:  (1) enhance and                         
              strengthen the research capabilities of life science                           
              faculty by providing expensive, state-of-the-art                               
              equipment, not presently available, to facilitate the                          
              application of monoclonal antibody (MAb) technology to                         
              ongoing and planned research programs; (2) enhance and                         
              strengthen research experiences for minority undergraduate                     
              and graduate students by facilitating the acquisition of                       
              intellectual and physical skills to become competitive in                      
              an area of biology which is rapidly achieving status as                        
              required background by the scientific community; and (3)                       
              foster research interactions between UTSA and other                            
              regional academic institutions with large minority                             
              enrollments in the biological sciences.  Furthermore, the                      
              enhanced research experiences are expected to contribute                       
              to increased entry of minority students into careers in                        
              the biosciences.  Initially nine investigators and their                       
              students propose to utilize the Hybridoma Research                             
              Laboratory to facilitate the application of MAb technology                     
              to ongoing research programs in physiology, molecular cell                     
              biology, genetics, biochemistry and neurobiology.  These                       
              research programs will impact 14 undergraduate and 7                           
              graduate minority students per year.//
