Abstract    :
                   This award will provide one-half the cost of acquiring a                  
              laser fusion source mass spectrometer system for argon 40/39                   
              dating in earth sciences research. The instrument will be                      
              operated and maintained in the Berkeley Geochronology Center of                
              the Institute of Human Origins. The Institute of Human Origins is              
              committed to providing the remaining funds required.                           
                   The single-crystal laser fusion mass spectrometer will be                 
              the second such instrument available to the earth science                      
              community in the U.S. The capabilities of this system constitute               
              a dramatic improvement in the precision and accuracy of dates for              
              geological and anthropological samples.
