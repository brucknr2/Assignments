Abstract    :
              This research is to permit the principal investigator to plan                  
              and do exploratory experiments on the dependence of copolymer                  
              surface structure on inherent molecular parameters.  The work is               
              being done as a Research Planning Grant under the Research                     
              Opportunities for Women program.
