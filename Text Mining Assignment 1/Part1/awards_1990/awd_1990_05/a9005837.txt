Abstract    :
              This research uses the measured scattering                                     
              parameters of GaAs and In (GaA1) As                                            
              heterojunction transistors (emitter-up and                                     
              emitter-down) to obtain an optimized model                                     
              of the device.  The method of modelling is                                     
              based on the simulated annealing algorithm                                     
              which avoids the problem of entrapment in                                      
              local minima encountered in conventional                                       
              methods of modelling.  The resultant model is                                  
              expected to lead devices that offer superior                                   
              microwave performance.
