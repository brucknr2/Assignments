Abstract    :
              In this research supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and                  
              Organometallic Chemistry Program, Alan H. Cowley of the                        
              University of Texas at Austin will investigate three areas of                  
              main group element chemistry: (a) elements in unusually low                    
              oxidation state, (b) elements with unusually low coordination                  
              number, and (c) polymeric materials incorporating main group                   
              elements. The first two areas are expected to generate new                     
              chemical compounds with unusual reactivities and properties.                   
              The polymers generated in the third project would likewise be                  
              new materials with interesting and potentially useful                          
              properties.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              New ligands will be developed that will have supplemental                      
              coordination capacity and be designed to stabilize main group                  
              elements in low oxidation state, such as phosphorus(+1),                       
              arsenic(+1), antimony(+1), bismuth(+1), gallium(+1) and                        
              aluminum(+1). In the second area, syntheses of analogues of                    
              transition metal alkylidenes and alkylidynes will be attempted                 
              with group 14 (for example, silicon and germanium) and 15 (for                 
              example, phosphorus and arsenic) elements replacing the multiply               
              bonded carbon to produce compounds with transition metal to                    
              main group element multiple bonds. The targeted transition                     
              metals to be employed are molybdenum, tungsten, rhenium, nio-                  
              bium, zirconium and hafnium. These compounds will then be ex-                  
              amined for reactivities similar to the transition metal                        
              alkylidenes and alkylidynes, which include polymerization                      
              reactions.
