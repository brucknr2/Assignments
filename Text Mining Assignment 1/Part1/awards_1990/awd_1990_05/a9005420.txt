Abstract    :
                   The research in this project is a continuation of the                     
              efforts of the principal investigator to discuss the qualitative               
              theory of flows and the dependence on parameters of these flows                
              of the attractor for functional differential equations (FDE) and               
              partial differential equations  (PDE).  The parameters in the PDE              
              are primarily the diffusion coefficients, boundary conditions                  
              and the domain.  For FDE, the parameters are the delays and                    
              rapidly oscillating forces.
