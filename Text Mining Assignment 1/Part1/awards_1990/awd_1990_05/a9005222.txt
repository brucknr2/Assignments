Abstract    :
                This collaborative research between Cornell University and                   
              Memphis State University is to process data previously collected               
              under NSF-supported PANDA network deployment in the San Juan and               
              Jujuy provinces of Argentina.  Over 20,000 earthquakes in San                  
              Juan, and over 1000 earthquakes in Jujuy were recorded, producing              
              over 100 GBytes of digital seismic data.  The objective of the                 
              project is to study crustal and lithospheric structure and                     
              seismicity in two contrasting areas of the eastern slopes of the               
              Andean uplift where seismogenic crustal shortening is occurring.
