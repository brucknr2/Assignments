Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Theoretical Intermediate Energy (Nuclear/Particle)                         
              Physics Group was established in 1987 through a Research                       
              Improvement in Minority Institutions (RIMI) grant from the                     
              National Science Foundation (NSF).  The grant period will                      
              end in the summer of 1990.  Funds are sought for the                           
              continuation of this group; however, now the structure                         
              will include nuclear experimentalists and will be known as                     
              the Nuclear Physics Group of which the theory group is a                       
              part.  The Nuclear Physics Group will serve as an umbrella                     
              for both theory and experimental Intermediate (Medium)                         
              Energy physics grant support from all funding sources.                         
              This structure will eventually lead to application for a                       
              NSF Minority Center of Excellence grant, for example.                          
              Funds to support one Research Assistant Professor, one                         
              graduate student, one part time Nuclear Physics Group                          
              Administrative Assistant (the other part of this salary                        
              has been included in an NSF nuclear experimental proposal                      
              submitted through Hampton University), and the Principal                       
              Investigator are requested.
