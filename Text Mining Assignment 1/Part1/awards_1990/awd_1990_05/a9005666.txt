Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research in algebraic combinatorics               
              of Professor Curtis Greene of Haverford College. Dr. Greene's                  
              project is to continue his work in a number of areas related to                
              partially ordered sets, tableaux, and representations of the                   
              symmetric group.                                                               
                   This research falls in the broad category of combinatorics,               
              which is one of the most active fields in today's mathematics.                 
              Fundamentally, combinatorics represents a systematization of the               
              very first of all mathematical activities, counting. In its                    
              modern development, however, combinatorics has gone beyond just                
              counting to make use of a wide variety of advanced mathematical                
              techniques, and although its roots go back several centuries, the              
              field has had an explosive development in the past few decades                 
              because of its importance in communications and information                    
              technology.
