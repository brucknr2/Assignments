Abstract    :
              The naphthylphthalamic acid receptor (NPAR) is a plant cell                    
              plasma membrane protein that plays a pivotal role in the                       
              regulation of the movement of the plant hormone auxin.  NPAR is                
              being isolated from zucchini using a combination of                            
              immunoaffinity and chromatographic techniques.  Flavenoids are                 
              shown to be NPAR ligands in vitro but the natural ligands are not              
              known.  Several specific flavenoids are being studied to                       
              determine the in vivo ligand.                                                  
                                                                                             
              Auxin movement in plants is particularly important to their                    
              growth and development.  The polar transport of auxin from its                 
              multiple sites of synthesis in the shoot apex and young leaves                 
              downward to the tissues in which it acts allows for a                          
              coordination of growth and development in disparate plant parts                
              and helps maintain the developmental polarity of the plant body.               
              The more local movement of auxin in and out of plant cells                     
              affects levels of free auxin in individual cellular compartments               
              containing receptors for auxin's actions.  The regulation of                   
              auxin movement is a major control point in plant development.                  
              Understanding how the NPA receptor works to control movement of                
              auxin in plants would be a major contribution to our                           
              understanding of the way that auxin plays its pattern-generating               
              and coordinating role in plant development and will advance our                
              ability to manipulate plant growth for agricultural purposes.
