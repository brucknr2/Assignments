Abstract    :
                   It is proposed to study the two-electron process of                       
              ionization plus excitation of the hydrogen molecule by fast                    
              projectiles, testing the theory of Reading and Ford.  Three                    
              measurements are proposed:  (1) Cross sections for excitation of               
              various excited states, as a function of projectile velocity and               
              charge and as a function of orientation of the internuclear axis,              
              intended to understand higher Born contributions and the                       
              importance of nondipole interactions.  (2) Cross sections for                  
              charge capture plus excitation to dipole allowed and nondipole                 
              allowed states, as well as charge capture plus ionization,                     
              intended to illustrate the importance of a fast or slow continuum              
              electron.  (3) Correlation between ejected electron and excited                
              hydrogen molecular ion state formed in an ionizing collision.
