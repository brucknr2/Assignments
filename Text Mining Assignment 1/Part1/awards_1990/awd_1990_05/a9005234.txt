Abstract    :
                   The objective of this project is to construct the first                   
              comprehensive loess chronology for South Island, New Zealand.                  
              About 85-90 regions will be collected.  Dating analyses in the TL              
              laboratory in Bellingham will be conducted.                                    
                   This project will build upon the previous detailed testing of             
              TL dating methods conducted by the PI on loess from North Island.              
              Further test will be conducted on a few known-age South Island                 
              Loess samples (remote from sources of volcanic feldspars in North              
              Island), and extensive applications of reliable partial-bleach                 
              procedures will be made to several undated key loess sections                  
              throughout South Island.  The resultant loess chronology will be               
              related to the development of associated Quaternary features such              
              as marine terraces, glacial outwash deposits and river terraces.               
              TL dates for such features and for several buried soils in the                 
              loess sequences will reveal the timing of environmental changes in             
              much of South Island, in the targeted time window of 20-200 ka.
