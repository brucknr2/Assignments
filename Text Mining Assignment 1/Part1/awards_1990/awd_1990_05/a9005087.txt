Abstract    :
                   Understanding the hydrology of faults and shear zones is                  
              critical to determining how fluids move through the crust and to               
              examining the fluid-rock interactions that occur during flow.                  
              This project will examine faults in granite to obtain evidence                 
              needed to assess spatial and temporal changes in fault zone                    
              permeability during fault evolution.  The permeability structure               
              will be incorporated into a numerical model for flow at both                   
              fault zone scale and at regional scales.  Results should                       
              strengthen observational and the theoretical basis for assessing               
              the role of fluids in a variety of tectonic processes.
