Abstract    :
                   The 1990 Theoretical Advanced Study Institute will be held                
              June 4-29, 1990 at the University of Colorado in Boulder.  This                
              summer school for advanced graduate students in theoretical                    
              elementary particle physics will focus on testing the standard                 
              model of the fundamental forces and particles.  Lectures will                  
              be given by leading physicists on a variety of topics both                     
              within and somewhat beyond the standard model.  The summer                     
              school will make a very important contribution to the advanced                 
              education of graduate students from throughout the United                      
              States.  In view of currently emerging data which sensitively                  
              probes the standard model, the topic of the school is very                     
              timely.
