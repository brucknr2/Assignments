Abstract    :
                   The study of large-scale systems and methods of computing                 
              their optimizations is an important area with many applications.               
                   Stochastic Programming is an important area in such studies.              
                   This activity will focus on development of stochastic                     
              programming problems.  Large scale here means the number of                    
              constraints as well as the number of decision and random                       
              variables in the problem can be large.  Both probabilistic                     
              (reliability type) constraints and penalties for deviations are                
              incorporated into the models.  The random variables are discrete               
              in some of the models and continuous in others but stochastic                  
              dependence is allowed in all cases.  In the case of continuously               
              distributed random variables a multivariate numerical integral                 
              approximation technique, will be used.                                         
                   Possible applications include optimization of earthquake                  
              resistant structures, water level regulation in lake systems,                  
              planning in interconnected power systems, solutions of economic,               
              finance, production problems.
