Abstract    :
              The plant hormone, ethylene, regulates a wide range of                         
              physiological and developmental processes in higher plants.  While             
              a significant amount of progress has recently been made in the                 
              elucidation of the ethylene biosynthetic pathway and in the                    
              molecular bases for a number of ethylene regulated processes,                  
              virtually nothing is known about the receptor and associated signal            
              transduction pathways in plants.  The goal of this proposal is the             
              molecular cloning and characterization of the ETR locus in                     
              Arabidopsis thalina.  Mutations in the ETR locus have been isolated            
              which cause insensitivity to a number of ethylene responses in the             
              plant.  Physiological evidence indicates that the mutations                    
              directly effect the ethylene receptor.  From a chromosome walk, an             
              18 kb region of cloned genomic DNA has been obtained which appears             
              to carry the ETR gene.  The investigators intend to identify the               
              specify sequences in this region that represent the ETR gene and               
              to obtain full length cDNA clones of the mutant and wild type                  
              genes.  The cDNA clones will also be used to manipulate the level              
              of expression of the wild type and mutant gene products in                     
              transgenic Arabidopsis and in a number of other plant species.                 
              Engineered mutations in the gene will allow an exploration of the              
              dominant nature of the etr phenotype.
