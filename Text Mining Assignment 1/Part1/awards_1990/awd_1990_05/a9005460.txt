Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              An mRNA has been identified which encodes a protein (SpEGF2)                   
              containing four domains related to epidermal growth factor and                 
              which accumulates at the onset of morphogenesis in developing sea              
              urchin embryos (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus). Dr. Angerer's                  
              hypothesis is that this protein, or peptides derived from it,                  
              function as a signaling factor secreted into the blastocoel.                   
              SpEGF2 protein contains a hydrophobic leader, lacks a                          
              transmembrane domain and is very similar to short, blastocoelic                
              peptides found in another sea urchin species (Anthocidaris                     
              crassispina) that cause a specific developmental abnormality,                  
              exogastrulation, when added to cultures of embryos of either                   
              genus. The developmental function in sea urchin embryogenesis of               
              the SpEGF2 peptide receptor signaling system will be investigated              
              using techniques of molecular genetics, immunology, biochemistry               
              and experimental embryology. Targets of SpEGF2 function will be                
              identified by 1) using anti-SpEGF2 antibodies, 2) binding labeled              
              synthetic or endogenous SpEGF2 peptide(s) to cells of the embryo               
              and 3) determining which cells express the SpEGF2 receptor mRNA                
              and peptide. Finally, the effects of blocking the activity of the              
              SpEGF2/SpEGF2-receptor signaling system on morphogenesis, cell                 
              division, and tissue specific gene expression in intact embryos                
              will be analyzed.
