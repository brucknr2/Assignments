Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The research proposed in this application addresses basic biological           
              questions concerning the normal functioning of the pancreatic islet in         
              the anglerfish.  This animal is ideally suited for the proposed studies        
              since it affords the highest yield of pancreatic endocrine cells of any        
              species currently known.  The proposed studies will add significant            
              novel insight into the anatomical distribution and also the nutrient           
              and neurotransmitter regulation of a key enzyme (peptidyl-glycine              
              alpha-amidating mono-oxygenase- PAM) which is involved in the post-            
              translational processing of islet endocrine hormones.  Furthermore the         
              proposed investigations will significantly increase our understanding          
              of the regulation of islet hormone secretion by two major                      
              neurotransmitters, norepinephrine and neuropeptide Y, which are                
              distributed throughout the animal kingdom.  The results of these               
              studies will provide new insight into basic mechanisms of islet cell           
              function and regulation by the nervous system in anglerfish and there          
              is also a very high probability that these findings will be applicable         
              to several other species.
