Abstract    :
                This research deals with the structural evolution of strike-                 
              slip fault zones as related to the statistics of earthquakes in                
              those zones and the geometry of the fault traces.  Significant                 
              results have already been obtained for the San Andreas fault in                
              California and the Anatolian fault in Turkey.  The work is to be               
              extended to faults in the Mojave Desert in California and strike-              
              slip faults in Japan.  These ideas have not only yielded new                   
              physical insights into faulting but have important implications                
              for earthquake hazard assessment.  This research is a component                
              of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
