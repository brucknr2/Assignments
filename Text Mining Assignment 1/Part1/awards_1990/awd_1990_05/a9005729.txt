Abstract    :
                   Professors Harrell and Loss will conduct research on                      
              spectral and variational analysis in several areas originating in              
              theoretical physics.  Three of their projects involve (i) direct               
              and inverse spectral questions about Schroedinger and Laplace-                 
              Beltrami operators, (ii) proofs of inequalities using the method               
              of competing symmetries, and (iii) continuous spectra and their                
              gaps.                                                                          
                   The research program is a balance between pure and applied                
              mathematics with a twofold purpose.  First, Harrell and Loss wish              
              to create formulae and theorems of real use to physicists,                     
              especially those working in quantum theory and statistical                     
              physics.  Secondly, the investigation may only be distantly                    
              related to physical calculation, but can cast light on structural              
              questions, such as what role symmetries and geometry play in the               
              spectral and inverse spectral theory of Schroedinger operators                 
              and their generalizations.
