Abstract    :
                   Professor Sahi will apply algebraic and analytic techniques               
              to study the spectrum of certain invariant differential operators              
              on Hermitian symmetric spaces.  Among the intended applications                
              are (i) invariant theory: to establish identities generalizing                 
              the classical Capelli identity, (ii) representation theory: to                 
              study certain reducibility and unitarizability questions, (iii)                
              analysis: to describe the homogeneous distributions on a                       
              formally real Jordan algebra and to extend Maxwell's theory of                 
              poles of spherical harmonics to this setting, (iv) number theory:              
              to extend results of Shimura on the arithmeticity of certain non-              
              holomorphic vector-valued Eisenstein series.                                   
                   The work described above involves the theory of                           
              representations of groups.  Group theory is basically the theory               
              of symmetry.  To take a simple example, when the system in                     
              question is invariant under a change in the position of the                    
              origin of space, the group of translations naturally arises.                   
              While groups are abstract objects, particular situations demand                
              concrete realizations or "representations" of the symmetry group.
