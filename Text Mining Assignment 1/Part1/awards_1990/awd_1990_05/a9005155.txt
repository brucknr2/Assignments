Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research will focus upon porous polymeric materials                       
              exhibiting a uniform sub-micron cell size which show great                     
              promise in applications such as membranes, catalyst supports,                  
              artificial skin, etc.  Current liquid-based phase separation                   
              technologies for producing these materials are limited be                      
              difficulties in solvent removal and structural heterogeneity                   
              introduced by thermal gradients.  It is proposed to generate                   
              uniform, cellular polymeric materials via a micro-phase                        
              separation induced in a polymer network swollen by a                           
              supericrtical fluid.  By taking advantage of the strong                        
              dependence of solvent power on pressure, a unique                              
              characteristic of supercritical fluids, one can assume finer                   
              control over the microstructure in porous materials than is                    
              presently available using conventional liquid solvents.                        
                                                                                             
              The research program will be divided into two phases.  In the                  
              first, the equilibrium swelling composition and the relaxation                 
              behavior of a polymer network exposed to supercritical CO2                     
              will be measured using a quartz spring microbalance and                        
              dielectric spectrometer, respectively.  These will be the                      
              first such measurements on a network/supercritical fluid                       
              system.  In the second phase, microporous materials will be                    
              generated via a phase separation in a supercritical fluid-                     
              swollen network.  Porosity will be measured using conventional                 
              techniques and correlated with the fundamental thermodynamic                   
              information compiled during the initial program phase.
