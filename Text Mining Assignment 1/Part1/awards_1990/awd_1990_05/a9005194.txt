Abstract    :
                   Heating of the solar corona will be studied by observing the              
              coronal oscillation spectrum at the total eclipse of 11 July                   
              1991. This will be an extremely favorable eclipse in terms of                  
              duration and probable viewing conditions. The observations                     
              provide a test of a mechanism to explain the heating of the solar              
              corona via Alfven waves.  The heating takes place in the region                
              of formation of the solar wind.  The proposed new experiment                   
              improves on prior observations during eclipses of 1980 and 1983                
              by improved image acquisition during totality, a major expansion               
              of the frequency range under observation through greatly improved              
              tracking, and through improved techniques of digitization and                  
              data recording. Undergraduate students will be actively involved               
              in both the instrument development, testing, and observation                   
              activities of this research. ***//
