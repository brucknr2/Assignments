Abstract    :
                This research is an investigation of the practical applications              
              of the theories of chaos towards understanding and predicting the              
              random aspects of seismicity.  If successful, these methods hold               
              great promise for becoming a practical method of predicting                    
              earthquakes on any chaotic fault system.  Utilizing earlier                    
              promising results, this work will estimate the amount of time                  
              that any deterministic model reflects the initial conditions                   
              rather than the chaotic nature of fault systems.  A test will be               
              made of two recently proposed, attractor-based methods of                      
              predicting seismicity on those fault systems.  This research is a              
              component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
