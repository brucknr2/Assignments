Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal is for support of theoretical studies aimed at                   
              retrieving thermodynamic data for F- and Cl- endmember micas,                  
              amphiboles and other phases for use in deciphering the behavior                
              of F and Cl in reacting hydrothermal systems.  These studies will              
              enable constraints to be placed on the speciation and total                    
              halide contents of hydrothermal fluids based on known                          
              compositions of silicate minerals.  In addition, it will be                    
              possible to predict how F and Cl partitioned between minerals and              
              aqueous fluids during water-rock interactions and whether this                 
              partitioning is important in the generation of F-rich ore                      
              deposits.  The most important aspects of this work are the                     
              retrieval of the thermodynamic properties of fluoride and                      
              chloride end-member minerals from published experimental studies,              
              and the application of these results to geologic problems.  The                
              scope of the research will be limited to these aspects.
