Abstract    :
                   The southern part of the Death Valley area contains the                   
              intersecting Garlock and southern Death Valley fault zones and                 
              the tectonic boundary between the Basin and Range province and                 
              the northeastern Mojave Desert.  The northeastern Mojave                       
              province, previously thought to not be extended, has recently                  
              been found to contain a west-rooting detachment fault system                   
              involving late Miocene strata in the Halloran Hills.  This                     
              project is designed to provide the detailed maps, structural                   
              geometry and kinematic information of the detachment required to               
              reassess the tectonics of the Mojave block and how the new                     
              information affects the late Cenozoic tectonic history of the                  
              region.
