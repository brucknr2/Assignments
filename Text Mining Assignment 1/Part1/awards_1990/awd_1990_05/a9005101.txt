Abstract    :
              In studying the physics of high-Tc superconductors, use the                    
              technique of tunneling to measure the energy gap as a function of              
              temperature; try to obtain sandwich-type tunnel junctions of                   
              sufficiently high quality to permit measurement of the electron-               
              phonon spectral function.
