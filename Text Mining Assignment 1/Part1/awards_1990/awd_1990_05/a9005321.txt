Abstract    :
                   This is a study of the reactions of atmospheric nitrogen                  
              compounds with components of airborne sea salt, and of the                     
              chemistry of the gaseous products of these reactions.  It is                   
              designed to clarify questions of atmospheric composition in                    
              coastal regions and of the possible impact of there reactions on               
              tropospheric ozone in the Arctic.                                              
                   Laboratory studies will be conducted to measure the absolute              
              kinetics of the reactions of HNO3, NO2 and N2O5 with NaCl and                  
              NaBr.  Whether these reactions continue to occur when the salts                
              are dissolved in ice will also be determined and compared to the               
              reactions of HBr in ice.  The photochemistry of the newly                      
              discovered gaseous BrNO2 and the atmospherically relevant                      
              kinetics and mechanisms of reaction of ClNO2 will also be                      
              determined.  The results of these experimental studies will then               
              be used to quantitatively assess the importance of these                       
              heterogeneous gas-solid reactions in the chemistry of regional                 
              polluted areas, as well as remote areas such as the Arctic.
