Abstract    :
              We propose to carry out a systematic spectroscopic study of the                
              crystal chemistry of iron, including investigations of oxidation,              
              reduction, disproportionation, and partitioning of iron in mantle              
              and core materials at elevated pressures.  The principal tools                 
              will be 57Fe Mossbauer and crystal-field spectroscopy,                         
              techniques that are ideally suited to studies of iron-bearing                  
              phases.  The results will be correlated with vibrational spectra               
              measured by Raman scattering and infrared absorption                           
              spectroscopy.  The multi-anvil apparatus at SUNY Stony Brook, and              
              diamond-anvil cell and piston-cylinder apparatus at the                        
              Geophysical Laboratory will be used for their complimentary                    
              pressure range and experimental conditions.  Spectra will also be              
              studied as a function of pressure in diamond-anvil cells.  We                  
              shall map the P-T-fO2 conditions of the graphite/diamond buffer                
              to lower mantle pressures with the piston-cylinder apparatus and               
              the multi-anvil device and at ultrahigh pressure with the                      
              diamond-anvil cell.  The results will be used to enlarge the                   
              existing thermodynamic database for iron-bearing mantle and core               
              materials, which is crucial for modelling the mineralogy,                      
              chemical composition, and oxidation state of the deep interior.
