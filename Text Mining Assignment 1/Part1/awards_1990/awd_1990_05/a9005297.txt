Abstract    :
                   This award provides one-half the funds required for the                   
              acquisition of a gas-source isotope ratio mass spectrometer to be              
              installed and operated by the Geophysical Laboratory of the                    
              Carnegie Institution of Washington. The Carnegie Institution is                
              committed to providing the remaining funds needed.                             
                   Recent improvements in the design of gas-source, isotope                  
              ratio mass spectrometers have greatly expanded the application of              
              stable isotope geochemistry to research in the evolution of life               
              and inorganic geochemical processes. This instrument will be used              
              in a number of research projects including studies of mass                     
              transfer processes in the Earth's crust and upper mantle and                   
              isotopic fractionation in biochemical metabolic reactions.
