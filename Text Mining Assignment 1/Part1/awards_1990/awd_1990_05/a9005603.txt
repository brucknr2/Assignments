Abstract    :
              In 1987, under the directorship of Dr. John Stachel, Princeton                 
              University Press produced volume one of The Collected Papers of                
              Albert Einstein," including the Einstein's writings and                        
              correspondence from 1879 to 1902.  This volume was especially                  
              important because of the discovery and publication of the                      
              correspondence between the young Einstein and his fellow student               
              and first wife, Mileva Maric.  Volume two, begun under Dr. Stachel,            
              was published in 1990 under the editorship of Dr. Martin Klein.                
              This volume included Einstein's publications from 1901 to 1909,                
              among them a number of works that were absolutely crucial in the               
              development of 20th century science. Both volumes were accompanied             
              by an English translation produced under the direction of Dr. Peter            
              Havas.                                                                         
                                                                                             
              With this three year grant, Dr. Martin Klein, with Drs. Jurgen Renn            
              and Robert Schulmann, will complete the preparation of volumes 3               
              through 7 of the Collected Papers.  Volumes 3, 4, 6 & 7 will                   
              present Einstein's writings from 1910 to 1922.   These papers                  
              include Einstein's work on his General Theory of Relativity.                   
              Volume 5 will present Einstein's correspondence from 1902 to 1914.             
              This grant will also support the preparation of the accompanying               
              English translation of these volumes.  Dr. Klein is assuming                   
              responsibility for the translation as well as the edition.                     
                                                                                             
              At the end of the three year period, it is the hope of the                     
              Princeton University Press to have raised an endowment to complete             
              the publication of 29 volumes of Einstein papers.  This project                
              will continue well into the second decade of the next century.                 
              In the meantime, researchers will be actively working on these                 
              papers.  NSF is pursuing additional ways of expediting this                    
              research.
