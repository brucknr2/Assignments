Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The many-body problem in quantum mechanics is well-known for its               
              complexity, but with the aid of supercomputers it should be                    
              possible to increase the accuracy of calculations by several                   
              orders of magnitude.  The use of supercomputers, however,                      
              presents many problems - new methods and new approaches need to                
              be developed.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              The long-range goal of this project is to develop parallel                     
              algorithms for atomic structure calculations, based on the proven              
              multiconfiguration Hartree-Fock method (MCHF), that execute                    
              efficiently on vector/concurrent architectures such as the shared              
              memory Cray Y-MP and the distributed memory Intel iPSC-RX                      
              hypercube.  The first task is the revision of the finite                       
              difference methods used by MCHF to spline based methods for which              
              higher accuracy and better vectorization properties have been                  
              achieved.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              The use of splines in MCHF atomic structure calculations, leads                
              to large, sparse, generalized eigenvalue problems for which only               
              a few eigenvalues and eigenvectors are needed.  Often the problem              
              is a non-linear, generalized eigenvalue problem.  Another                      
              frequently occurring problem is the solution of large, sparse,                 
              structured systems of equations where parts of the matrix are                  
              dense.  Vector/concurrent algorithms for these problems will be                
              developed and incorporated into an atomic structure package based              
              on the MCHF method.
