Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This laboratory has cloned and characterized several avirulence                
              genes from bacterial pathogens in the Pseudomonas syringae group               
              that are responsible for defensive surveillance by soybean                     
              plants.  One of these genes, avrD from P. syringae pv. tomato,                 
              causes bacterial hosts to elaborate an extracellular elicitor                  
              compound.  The isolated elicitor causes the hypersensitive                     
              response (HR) only on soybean cultivars containing                             
              thecomplementary disease resistance gene, Rpg4.  AvrD also has                 
              several other interesting features such as its occurrence, along               
              with four other linked genes, on an indigenous bacterial plasmid               
              and its 100-fold induction when bacteria are grown in soybean                  
              leaves as compared to culture media.  The interaction of bacteria              
              carrying avrD with plant hosts therefore involves reciprocal                   
              signalling mechanisms that initiate precise developmentalprograms              
              in both organisms.  This proposal requests support to further                  
              study avrD and its role in initiating plant disease resistance by              
              1) characterizing the avrD elicitor; 2) elucidating the nature of              
              plant induction of avrD; 3) studying the indigenous plasmid on                 
              which avrD occurs and 4) comparing avrD withhomologous genes that              
              occur in other P. syringae pathovars.                                          
                                                                                             
              The proposed research should contribute significantly to our                   
              understanding of plant-microbe signalling mechanisms and disease               
              resistance in plants.
