Abstract    :
              Sedimentary and low-grade metamorphic pelitic rocks record the                 
              occurrence, timing and magnitude of interaction with crustal                   
              fluids, but radiogenic isotopic studies of such rocks and events               
              lead to ambiguous results due to heterogeneity of source of the                
              key minerals, especially clay minerals.  The project will combine              
              radiogenic isotopic studies (Rb-Sr and K-Ar) with detailed                     
              characterization by scanning transmission electron microscopy                  
              (STEM) in order to provide a firm basis of interpretation of the               
              isotopic data.  The proposal is based on a successful "pilot                   
              project" development of methods for Rb-Sr analysis of Gulf Coast               
              shales that have verified "episodic" diagenesis by tectonically-               
              induced fluid flow.  This research will expand the studies to the              
              full range of diagenesis - low-grade metamorphism with further                 
              studies of Gulf Coast shales, and analyses of continuous                       
              sequences across northern New York and in Wales that span the                  
              range from late diagenesis to greenschist facies metamorphism.
