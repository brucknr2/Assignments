Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Inorganic phosphate is an important part of cells as well as                   
              body components such as bone.  The amount of phosphate within an               
              organism can alter bodily calcium balance, acidity of body                     
              fluids, and growth.  Phosphate regulation is therefore important               
              in all vertebrates.  Dietary intake, intestinal absorption and                 
              renal excretion determine the body phosphate balance.  The                     
              processes in the kidneys which control the excretion of phosphate              
              are not understood in animals such as birds and fishes.  Unlike                
              mammals, the latter have a mechanism to transfer phosphate                     
              directly from blood to the urine through kidney cells.  The                    
              objectives of this work include the study of the mechanism of                  
              phosphate transfer at both the cellular and cell membrane levels.              
              Regulation of phosphate excretion by the kidneys involves the                  
              interaction of hormones, acid-base balance, and dietary phosphate              
              availability.  Dr. Renfro will examine the basic cellular                      
              processes by which these factors alter body phosphate.
