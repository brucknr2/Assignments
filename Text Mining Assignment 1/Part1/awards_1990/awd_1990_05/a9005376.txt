Abstract    :
                   Fluids and fluid flow are important parameters in the                     
              deformation of accretionary prisms and in the formation of                     
              melanges.  Stratigraphically controlled fluid pathways are                     
              destroyed early in the evolution of accretionary prisms and                    
              therefore fault-zone melanges, with their associated fracture                  
              permeability, must be important during the long-term fluid loss                
              in accretionary prisms.  This study will utilize melange zones in              
              the developing accretionary complex of the Olympic Peninsula,                  
              Washington.  These melanges are currently leaking hydrocarbon                  
              rich fluids and include cements and veins that attest to their                 
              role as paleo-fluid conduits.  Results of various types of data                
              will be applied to the goal of defining the nature and variation               
              of fluid flow and composition, its interrelationship with the                  
              structural history, and the affects of both on the thermal                     
              evolution of an accretionary complex.
