Abstract    :
              According to the classical theory of measuring flow by                         
              Doppler ultrasound, one can estimate only that component                       
              of the flow that is in the direction of the ultrasound                         
              beam.  The PI has discovered that flow that is                                 
              perpendicular to the ultrasound can also be measured by                        
              appropriate analysis of the spectrum of the reflected                          
              signal.  This is a proposal to extend this novel finding                       
              to turbulent flow and to design transducers that allow                         
              determination of blood flow under either laminar or                            
              turbulent flow conditions.  The proposed research has the                      
              potential of greatly improving our ability to measure                          
              blood flow noninvasively.
