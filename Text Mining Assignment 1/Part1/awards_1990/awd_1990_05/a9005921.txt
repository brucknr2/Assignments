Abstract    :
                   Taxonomic understanding of the broad interrelationships of                
              groups of flowering plants can both facilitate and constrain                   
              comparative study of the morphology, physiology, and ecology of                
              plants.  Where taxa have been well sampled, deep knowledge of                  
              their evolutionary or genealogical relationships leads to                      
              fruitful comparisons of homologous structures or biochemical                   
              pathways or life-histories.  When the taxa are not well known,                 
              comparisons are often made between spuriously related forms, and               
              arguments may perpetuate endlessly over whether convergence or                 
              true evolutionary relationship accounts for the similarity in                  
              form or function under study.  Dr. Larry Hufford of the                        
              University of Minnesota has organized a large-scale symposium for              
              the Botanical Society of America meetings in Richmond, Virginia,               
              on the topic of the evolutionary relationships of the highly                   
              advanced dicots of the subclass Asteridae, including the                       
              sunflower, potato, and madder families, among the largest in the               
              world in numbers of species.                                                   
                   Fourteen speakers, including four from Europe, will address               
              in turn morphological data, from living and fossil plants, and                 
              molecular data, from recent DNA analyses of these plants, to                   
              identify areas of agreement and disagreement in our understanding              
              of the phylogeny of Asteridae and to target projects necessary to              
              achieve resolution.  Plans have already been made for publication              
              of the meeting's deliberations, so the results will become widely              
              available to all interested botanists.
