Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The dynein ATPases are complex, multisubunit enzymes that generate        
              the forces for a variety of microtubule-based movements.  The function         
              of the different dynein subunits in the generation of motility is              
              largely unknown, but the study of mutants with defective flagellar             
              motility in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii has identified several genes that        
              alter the structure and function of the outer dynein arm.  One of these        
              genes, the sup-pf-1 locus, is the structural gene for the B subunit of         
              the outer arm complex.  The mechanisms by which the B chain contributes        
              to dynein activity and flagellar motility will be studied by the               
              analysis of wild-type and mutant alleles of the sup-pf-1 locus.  The           
              specific aims are:  1) To characterize the microtubule binding and             
              translocation properties of wild-type and mutant B subunits by in vitro        
              assays.  2) To determine the physical locations of the microtubule             
              binding site (s) and the sup-pf-1 regulatory regions by photolytic and         
              proteolytic cleavage techniques.  3) To identify the position of               
              specific functional domains within the DNA sequence of the B chain gene,       
              and to characterize the DNA sequences in both mutant and wild-type             
              alleles.                                                                       
                   This combined genetic, biochemical, and molecular approach will           
              provide new insights into the basic mechanisms of dynein-based motility.
