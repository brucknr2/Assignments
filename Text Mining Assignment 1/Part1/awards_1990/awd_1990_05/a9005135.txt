Abstract    :
              This work is directed toward understanding the kinetics and                    
              mechanisms of heterogeneous selective oxidation of cycle                       
              alkenes and of oxygen-addition reactions and selective                         
              oxidation of linear alkenes on selected metal surfaces,                        
              principally silver.  It includes the identification of                         
              reaction products and determination of reaction selectivity                    
              under oxygen-rich and oxygen-lean conditions; the                              
              determination of the rate-determining step in the formation of                 
              each product, and of the activation energy and preexponential                  
              factor for each such steps; the identification of reaction                     
              intermediates, and the clarification of the details of the                     
              elementary bond-breaking and bond-forming processes leading                    
              from reactant to product.  The study employs a combination of                  
              ultrahigh-vacuum techniques including temperature-programmed                   
              reaction spectroscopy and vibrational spectroscopy; in some                    
              cases, synchrotron radiation techniques are used to assist in                  
              the determination of adsorbate geometries.                                     
                                                                                             
              The systems under study form the basis of a number of                          
              commodity and specialty chemical processes in which                            
              selectivity and minimization of deleterious byproducts are                     
              crucial to commercial success.  This work should provide                       
              valuable guidance for design improvements and control in these                 
              processes.
