Abstract    :
              Components necessary to complete construction of a high-                       
              resolution electron energy loss (HREELS) spectrometer are                      
              acquired and assembled.  Initially, this system will be used                   
              to study the adsorption and reaction of organic molecules on                   
              single-crystal surfaces of conducting and insulating metal                     
              oxides.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              This work is relevant to ongoing efforts to develop new                        
              selective catalysts for a variety of industrial processes.                     
              including replacements for chlorofluorocarbons and water-                      
              treatment chemicals.
