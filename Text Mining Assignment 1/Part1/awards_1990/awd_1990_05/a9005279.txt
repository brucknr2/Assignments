Abstract    :
                   The goal of the present work is to better understand the                  
              structure-plasticity correlation in high-temperature deformation               
              in materials with crystal structures relevant to the Earth's deep              
              interior.  The PI will conduct extensive studies on deformation                
              properties on both single and polycrystals of materials with                   
              perovskite and garnet structures.  The primary purposes of this                
              series of studies are to determine the constitutive relations                  
              (creep laws and deformation mechanism maps) and to study the                   
              microscopic mechanism(s) of deformation to understand the origin               
              of correlation between plasticity and structure.  A wide range of              
              experimental techniques will be employed to achieve this goal.
