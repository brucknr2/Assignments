Abstract    :
                   This award provides one-half the funds required to purchase               
              equipment for upgrading the computational facility for                         
              geochemistry research in the Department of Geology and                         
              Geophysics at Yale University. The University is committed to                  
              providing the remaining funds needed.                                          
                   The upgrade will consist in adding  computer memory, disk                 
              space, and improving the graphics capability of the existing                   
              system. The upgraded system will be used primarily in research                 
              projects such as the quantum mechanical study of  silicates,                   
              molecular dynamics of glasses and melts, Monte Carlo simulations               
              of crystal growth and dissolution, molecular studies of                        
              heterogeneous kinetics (including adsorption and mineral                       
              dissolution), and modeling of fluid flow and chemical reactions                
              in sedimentary basins.
