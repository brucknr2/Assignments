Abstract    :
              A Comprehensive program of research is planned that is centered                
              on the oxygen isotope analyses of phosphate from both natural                  
              materials and various forms of apatite that will be synthesized                
              in the laboratory.  Specific goals are (1) the refinement of the               
              method of preparation and isotopic analysis of phosphatic oxygen,              
              (2) the experimental determination of the equilibrium oxygen                   
              isotope fractionation factors between dissolved phosphate and                  
              water and between various crystalline apatites and water over a                
              very large range of temperatures from near Oo to 8OOoC, (3) the                
              development of a single mineral oxygen isotope thermometer based               
              on hydroxapatite and application to natural systems, (5) the use               
              of 18O contents of teeth and bones to make important distinctions              
              between marine and fresh water fish.                                           
              Some novel techniques will be employed in conducting this                      
              research.  The extraction of oxygen from very small samples of                 
              phosphate will be made with a laser fluorination system recently               
              established at the University of Michigan.  Catalysts will be                  
              used                                                                           
              to obtain exchange equilibrium between phosphates and water at                 
              relatively low temperatures.  Well crystallized hydroxy-and                    
              fluorapatite will be synthesized by a bacterial reaction in which              
              enzymatic activity should promote attainment of isotopic exchange              
              equilibrium.  Obtaining reliable equilibrium fractionation                     
              factors in these systems over a large temperature range will be                
              extremely useful in the resolution of a variety of petrological,               
              paleoclimatological and paleoecological problems.
