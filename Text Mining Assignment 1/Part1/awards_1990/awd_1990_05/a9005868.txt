Abstract    :
              A model for unlubricated wear of ceramic materials will be                     
              developed and validated.  Model development will be based                      
              on material loss due to brittle cracking.  The amount of                       
              cracking will, in turn, will be modeled based on the                           
              effects of thermal and elastic contact and frictional                          
              stresses on the nucleation and propagation of subsurface                       
              cracks at triple point grain boundaries.  The solid                            
              mechanics analyses will be supported by scaled potoelastic                     
              contact experiments.  The wear model will be validated                         
              using existing wear data for typical ceramic materials.
