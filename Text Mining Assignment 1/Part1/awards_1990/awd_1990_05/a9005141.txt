Abstract    :
                   Monocotyledons are one of the two main groups of flowering                
              plants.  A special symposium entitled "Systematics and Evolution               
              of the Monocotyledons" was held at the 1986 meeting of the                     
              American Institute of Biological Sciences.  Dr. George Rogers                  
              has created a Proceedings Volume from the seven research articles              
              produced for this symposium.  Dr. Rogers proposes to publish                   
              these as a volume in the Annals of the Missouri Botanical                      
              Gardens.                                                                       
                   The proceedings volume will bring together several of the                 
              most important contributions to our understanding of this major                
              plant group.  The Annals is a widely distributed and highly                    
              respected journal, and publication in this series will ensure                  
              wide impact.  Students and researchers will turn to this volume                
              as a milestone in botanical research.
