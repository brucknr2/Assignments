Abstract    :
              This work is aimed at the study of why some metal atoms in single              
              layers are metallic and others are not.  Overlayers of metals on               
              oxygen and carbon monoxide on tungsten(110), the oxygen                        
              chemisorption and heterogeneous oxidation of carbon monoxide,                  
              water formation and other surface reactions on bimetallic                      
              substrates like palladium on tungsten (110) are proposed for                   
              study.
