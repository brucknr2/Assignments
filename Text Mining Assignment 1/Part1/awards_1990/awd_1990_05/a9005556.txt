Abstract    :
              This research will build on recent experimental and                            
              theoretical discoveries concerning lipid monolayers at the                     
              air-water interface, discoveries based in large part on the                    
              use of epifluorescence microscopy.  The objective of this                      
              research is to exploit further these microscopic techniques                    
              so as to detect with ultrahigh sensitivity physical,                           
              chemical, photochemical and biochemical events that occur at                   
              this interface.                                                                
                                                                                             
              Topics of special relevance to this overall objective include                  
              the investigation of the structural properties of molecules                    
              (for example peptides) that affect the free energy along                       
              boundaries between lipid domains, molecular events that                        
              modify the local monolayer pressure and photochemical                          
              reactions involving attack of reactive oxygen species on                       
              lipids and other surface active molecules.  Biochemical                        
              events of special interest include studies of lipases that                     
              selectively attack molecules at domain boundaries, and                         
              molecular events relevant to cell-cell recognition, and                        
              virus-cell recognition.  Experiments will be conducted to see                  
              if the shapes, and shape transitions of lipid domains can be                   
              used to detect products derived from microlectorphoresis.                      
                                                                                             
              From a long-term point of view these experiments may lead to                   
              new techniques for detecting, and manipulating small numbers                   
              of molecules, especially biological macromolecules.
