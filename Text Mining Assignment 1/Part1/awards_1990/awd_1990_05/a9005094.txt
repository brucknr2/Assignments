Abstract    :
                   The sensitivity of the present resonant-mass                              
              gravitational-wave detector is limited by the relatively low                   
              electrical quality factor and the restricted bandwidth of the                  
              transducers.  In order to reach the potential sensitivity of                   
              third-generation, ultralow-temperature gravitational-wave                      
              detectors, significant improvement must be made in the                         
              transducers.                                                                   
              Prof. Paik will construct, test, and deliver new transducers to                
              work with the most sensitive bar detectors at Stanford and                     
              Louisiana State Universities.  This collaboration will enable                  
              those receivers to reach new levels of sensitivity within the                  
              next three years.
