Abstract    :
              This is study of magmatic processes occurring at crust and                     
              mantle levels in volcanic arcs using 238U and 232Th decay series               
              systematics.  Part of the funding will be used to complete                     
              ongoing projects that focus on the processes and lengths of time               
              required to generate and accumulate rhyolite in Cascade arc                    
              volcanoes.  The volcanoes that are being studied (medicine Lake                
              and Crater Lake) have erupted silicic magmas in the Holocene, and              
              are well-known geologically and geochemically through the work of              
              U.S.G.S. collaborators.  Approximately 6-9 months will be                      
              necessary to complete the analyses of whole rocks and contained                
              mineral phases for nuclide activities, to determine magma                      
              residence times with open-system modeling techniques, and to                   
              write up the results.  The remainder of the 2-year study period                
              will be used to investigate the origin of mafic magmas that are                
              the geochemical and thermal parents of Central American arc magma              
              systems.  We will analyze 20-25 rocks from the Central American                
              arc and sediments from the Cocos Plate for 238U-230Th-226Ra-232Th              
              activities.  These same rocks are being analyzed by other                      
              scientists for 10Be/Be ratios, Sr, Nd, and Pb isotopic ratios,                 
              and B, trace element, and major element concentrations.  The goal              
              is to delineate the nature of the subducting slab component in                 
              Central American arc magmas, the way it becomes involved in arc                
              magma genesis, and the time scales required for magma generation               
              and transport.
