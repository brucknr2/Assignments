Abstract    :
              This project will focus on the Colorado Plateau and adjoining                  
              regions where an inferred Proterozoic-aged, peridotite root                    
              extends to a depth of approximately 80-100 km and is surrounded                
              by rifted continental lithosphere.  Abundant samples of the upper              
              mantle occur in volcanic rocks on and off the Colorado Plateau,                
              and some mineral phases in these xenoliths record the recent                   
              compositional history of the lithosphere.  Trace element                       
              abundances (REE,Ti,Zr,Hf,Sr) of mineral phases will be used to                 
              deduce the variation in the bulk composition of the lithosphere                
              vertically and laterally, the nature of the phases involved in                 
              recent magmatic or metasomatic events, the nature of any trace                 
              element fractionations (e.g., REE/HFSE) coincident with these                  
              events, and the timing of these events from modelling of zoning                
              profiles.  Principal analytical tools will be the ion and                      
              electron microprobes for in situ analysis of trace and major                   
              elements.
