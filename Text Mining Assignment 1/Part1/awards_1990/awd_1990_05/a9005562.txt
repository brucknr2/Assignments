Abstract    :
              The Antarctic is currently experiencing a thirty to fifty percent              
              springtime loss of its stratospheric ozone layer, resulting in a               
              least a several-fold increase in UVB (280-320nm) radiation                     
              reaching the surface of the Southern Ocean.  In spite of low                   
              solar elevation and persistent cloud cover, the magnitude of                   
              ultraviolet radiation fluence rates now experienced in polar                   
              regions roughly approaches that routinely measured in tropical                 
              latitudes.  Perhaps more importantly, biologically damaging UVB                
              radiation has increased in the Antarctic while both UVA (320-                  
              400nm) and photosynthetically available radiation (PAR, 400-                   
              700nm) have remained unchanged.  This collaborative project will               
              use recently developed improvements in atmospheric modeling and                
              in-water UV and visible spectroradiometers to conduct a field                  
              study during austral spring 1990.  The day-to-day variations in                
              the magnitude and ratio of UVB:UVA:PAR irradiance incident on and              
              penetrating the euphotic zone of marginal ice edge Antarctic                   
              waters will be qualified.  The impact of this increase of UV                   
              radiation on abundance, composition and vitality of the                        
              phytoplankton community during the ice-edge spring bloom will be               
              documented.  During this time, strong vertical stratification                  
              restricts the phytoplankton to the upper water column, thus                    
              creating favorable conditions for increased UVB susceptibility.                
              Special emphasis will be placed on defining biological restraints              
              imposed by enhanced UVB radiation and altered UVB:UVA:PAR ratios               
              on the balance of UVB photodamage to photorepair, photoprotective              
              and photosynthetic mechanisms operating in the water column.                   
              The overall aim is an objective test of the hypothesis that                    
              phytoplankton in Antarctic waters are adversely unfluenced by                  
              ozone depletion.
