Abstract    :
                   This research concerns several problems which lie at the                  
              interface of operator theory and function theory.  The first part              
              of the project involves polynomial approximation directed at                   
              understanding certain measures on the closed unit disc.  The                   
              other part of the project involves a study of the composition                  
              operators on various spaces of analytic functions.  This includes              
              work on identifying the spectrum of a composition operator,                    
              continuing work on the study of composition operators on large                 
              weighted Bergman spaces, and the question of identifying the                   
              components in the space of composition operators in the uniform                
              operator topology.                                                             
                   This research is in the general area of modern analysis and,              
              as noted above, lies at the interface of operator theory and                   
              function theory.  The research involves the study of composition               
              operators on spaces of analytic functions in one or several                    
              complex variables and is a central topic in the modern theory of               
              complex analysis.
