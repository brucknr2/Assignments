Abstract    :
                   This project concerns two problems involving the averaging                
              of partial differential equations with important applications go               
              Physics.  The first one consists of studying the response                      
              tensor, i.e. the tensor of effective properties of a composite                 
              material in which different processes are coupled, such as                     
              thermoelectric or thermoelastic media.  The second is to study                 
              the long time, large-scale asymptotics of diffusion-advection                  
              equations in which the velocity is a random, incompressible                    
              field, with a continuum of excited space and time scales.  This                
              equation is known to exhibit interesting crossover phenomena,                  
              which are not well understood in the multidimensional case.                    
                   The principal investigator hopes to develop new mathematical              
              insight to such problems, based on the theory of homogenization.               
              In particular, the advection-diffusion problem involves                        
              understanding renormalization of equations with random                         
              coefficient outside the regime in which mean-field theory is                   
              valid.
