Abstract    :
                   This award provides one-half the funding for the acquisition              
              of a thermal ionization source mass spectrometer that will be                  
              operated by the geoscience departments of the Research Triangle                
              Universities (University of North Carolina, Duke University and                
              North Carolina State University). The institutions have jointly                
              committed the necessary remaining funds for this acquisition.                  
                   The new instrument will be part of the analytical facilities              
              of a Triangle Universities consortium for microanalysis, and will              
              be used primarily for uranium-lead, rubidium-strontium and                     
              samarium-neodymium isotopic analyses leading to interpretations                
              of oceanic sediments, marine carbonate stratigraphy, the modern                
              terrestrial sedimentary environment, and the structure and                     
              evolution of the continental lithosphere.
