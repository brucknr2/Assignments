Abstract    :
              The proposed research investigates a logic network synthesis                   
              system, called SYLON, which is an extension and integration of the             
              transduction method, negative gate synthesis algorithms, and                   
              previous synthesizers. Design tools in SYLON automatically solve               
              various IC  design problems.  This research is on improving the                
              system's capability to design compact networks with a large numbers            
              of inputs.  In addition, the system is being modified to design                
              circuits which are fast on critical paths.  Compaction of ROMs is              
              being addressed using a novel technique of storing a disjunction               
              of minterms at each crosspoint of memory lines, instead of a single            
              minterm.
