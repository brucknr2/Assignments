Abstract    :
                   The problem of stirring of chemical tracers in the mantle will            
              be addressed by developing three-dimensional computer models of                
              flow and tracer advection.  Some comparable and complementary                  
              laboratory studies of stirring will be undertaken in Australia.                
              Since parallel computers hold the greatest promise of providing the            
              large improvements in computer performance that will be required               
              for detailed three-dimensional modelling, the models will developed            
              for a parallel computer.  The Connection Machine is the favored                
              computer.
