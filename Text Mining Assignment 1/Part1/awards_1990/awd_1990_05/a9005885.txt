Abstract    :
                   This is a grant under the Scientific Computing Research                   
              Equipment for the Mathematical Sciences program of the Division                
              of Mathematical Sciences of the National Science Foundation.                   
              This program supports the purchase of special purpose computing                
              equipment dedicated to the conduct of research in the                          
              mathematical sciences.  This equipment is required for several                 
              research projects and would be difficult to justify for one                    
              project alone.  Support from the National Science Foundation is                
              coupled with discounts and contributions from manufacturers and                
              with substantial cost-sharing from the institutions submitting                 
              the proposal.  This program is an example of academic,                         
              corporate, and government cooperation in the support of the basic              
              research in the mathematical sciences.                                         
                   This equipment will be used to support three research                     
              projects in  the Department of Operations Research and Applied                 
              Statistics of George Mason University.  The names of the                       
              investigators and the titles of their projects follow:  Edward                 
              Wegman, Three-dimensional Andrews Plots and Three-dimensional                  
              Grand Tours;  Clifton Sutton and Edward Wegman, Data Set Mapping;              
              and John Miller, Fault Tolerant Parallel Algorithms for                        
              Stochastic and Nonstochastic Data.
