Abstract    :
                   The IEEE Communication Theory Workshop is held yearly at                  
              various sites in the United States. The 1990 Workshop is the 20th              
              in the series and will be held in Ojai, California, on June 24-27.             
              Sessions at the workshop consist solely of invited papers and the              
              speakers generally represent the highest echelon of the                        
              communications research community.  The purpose of the workshop is             
              to present primarily new results in all areas of communication                 
              theory; including, for example, modulation and coding, signal                  
              processing for ISDN, optical communications, and multi-user                    
              communications. These topics are highly important to both basic                
              theoretical advances in digital communications and application to              
              commercial telecommunications.  The NSF award is used to provide               
              travel funds for U.S. scientists and engineers who could not                   
              otherwise attend due to lack of funding.
