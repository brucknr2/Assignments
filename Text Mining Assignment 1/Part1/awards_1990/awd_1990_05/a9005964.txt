Abstract    :
              Dr. Daniel P. Weitekamp is supported by a grant from The                       
              Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to study spin-symmetry                 
              isomers of hydrogen by nuclear magnetic resonance.                             
              Instrumentation will be developed to achieve greatly enhanced                  
              magnetic resonance sensitivity in order that the reaction                      
              details of catalytic processes, such as those involving                        
              petroleum cracking and polymer manufacture, can be more clearly                
              elucidated.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              The technical and conceptual developments under this study have                
              broader significance than the particular systems to be examined                
              here and will be relevant to any technology based on the                       
              transformation of hydrogen. The ability to supply a rapidly                    
              cycled, high-sensitivity spin label in the form of parahydrogen                
              creates new possibilities for the NMR probe as a reactor.                      
              Two-dimensional experiments are proposed in which the NMR                      
              signal of the product molecules reports on the spectrum of the                 
              reaction intermediates.
