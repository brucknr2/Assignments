Abstract    :
                   The Younger Dryas climate event is important in earth                     
              history because it is a rapid reversal in climate change that                  
              occurred without any known, direct external forcing.  Thus it is               
              the best example of the earth's internal feedbacks causing                     
              climate change.  At present, the effects of the Younger Dryas                  
              cooling event are poorly known in many parts of the world.  The                
              purpose of this research is to determine the timing and                        
              climatological effects of this event in Minnesota and                          
              Wisconsin.  The PI will use annually-laminated lake sediments to               
              precisely date the timing of this vegetation change.  Then the PI              
              will evaluate the pollen in the cores to determine the changes in              
              temperature and precipitation that accompanied the climatic                    
              event. Given the possibility of internal feedbacks altering the                
              effects of future greenhouse warming, it is important to study                 
              this past example in order to better predict future changes in                 
              climate.
