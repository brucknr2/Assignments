Abstract    :
                   A GPS survey network will investigate the relationship                    
              between caldera deformation and deformation of the Taupo Volcanic              
              Zone (TVZ) OF North Island, New Zealand.  GPS stations in these                
              high strain rate areas will be resurveyed in the second year of                
              this experiment.  The high accuracy epoch GPS measurements which               
              are made during the surveys will also be the basis for future                  
              deformation monitoring.  It is anticipated that future                         
              measurements will be made by Victoria University and the NZGS as               
              GPS programs are developed there.
