Abstract    :
              This program is a study of the interaction of clusters of                      
              galaxies with the cosmic microwave background radiation.  Both                 
              theoretical calculations and a series of observations will be                  
              made.  The principle investigator has been largely responsible                 
              for the observational evidence for the existence of the Sunyaev-               
              Zel'dovich effect, which predicts small irregularities in the                  
              background radiation due to the effect of clusters of galaxies.                
              These observations and their interpretation are very difficult,                
              and this investigator is widely regarded as the leading expert on              
              these studies.  If successful, this work will lead to a greater                
              knowledge of the constituents of clusters of galaxies, and a new               
              method of determining the Hubble constant.
