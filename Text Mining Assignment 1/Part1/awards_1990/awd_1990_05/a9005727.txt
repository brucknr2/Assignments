Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              With this award, the Synthetic Organic Program will support the                
              research of Dr. Gary A. Molander of the Department of Chemistry                
              at the University of Colorado.  Dr. Molander's research focuses                
              on the area of stereoselective synthesis.  Methodology                         
              involving  neighboring group participation, the use of                         
              optically active organometallics and utilization of chiral                     
              epoxides form the basis of the proposed studies.                               
                                                                                             
              Dr. Molander will center his efforts on three areas of                         
              stereoselective organic synthesis.  First, Dr. Molander will                   
              strive to develop a general method for achieving 1,4- and                      
              1,5-relative asymmetric induction in the addition of carbon                    
              nucleophiles to prochiral electrophilic centers.  In a second                  
              area, he will generate chiral organometallics using                            
              thermodynamic equilibration of an internally complexed                         
              organomagnesium.  In a third, he will probe unique uses of                     
              enantiomerically enriched oxiranes in organic synthesis.                       
              Several methods for regio- and stereocontrolled ring opening                   
              reactions of oxiranes are proposed, all of which constitute                    
              useful routs to enantiomerically enriched organic molecules.
