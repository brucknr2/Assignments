Abstract    :
                This research is an extension of an ongoing project to image                 
              the subsurface geometry of active faults associated with the San               
              Andreas system in southern California.  The geometry of mapped                 
              active faults will be found by pre-stack migration of existing                 
              seismic reflection datasets.  The imaged faults will be related                
              to regional deep crustal structures and tested for evidence of                 
              Poisson's ratio variations from amplitude-versus-offset trends,                
              suggesting tectonically-active zones of weakness.  Data from the               
              EDGE and Calcrust projects will be used to investigate the Santa               
              Maria Basin and Tehachapi Mountains areas.  This research is a                 
              component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
