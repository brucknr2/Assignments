Abstract    :
                   This award provides partial funding for the acquisition of a              
              mass spectrometer to be installed and operated in the Department               
              of Geological Sciences at San Diego State University. The                      
              University is committed to providing the remaining funds needed.               
                   San Diego State University's Department of Geological                     
              Sciences has a strong training program for undergraduates and up               
              to the master's level that includes practical work with advanced               
              geochemical techniques. The Department also has made several                   
              recent appointments in isotope geochemistry (the PI and co-PI of               
              this award), and the University has put considerable resources in              
              establishing an Institute of Isotope Geochemistry. The research                
              projects of the PI and co-PI are supported by NSF and other                    
              agencies and require the analytical capabilities of a modern mass              
              spectrometer. The instrument will also be used in two laboratory               
              courses open to undergraduate students (Isotope Geochemistry and               
              Groundwater Geochemistry). This award is made under the auspices               
              of the NSF program Research in Undergraduate Institutions.
