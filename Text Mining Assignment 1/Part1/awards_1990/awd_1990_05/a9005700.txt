Abstract    :
                   The PI will conduct airborne measurements of 222Rn as part                
              of the Pacific Stratus/Sulfur Investigation.  The radionuclide                 
              measurements will compliment measurements made by the NASA/Ames                
              tracking sun photometer, the NOAA/PMEL sulfur gas chromatograph                
              and the NOAA aerosol size distribution probes to investigate the               
              postulated link between marine dimethyl sulfide emissions and the              
              reflective properties of marine stratus clouds.  Altitude                      
              profiles will be conducted to locate layers of enhanced particle               
              abundance or thin cloud, and samples for radionuclide and sulfur               
              gas analysis will be collected in and between the layers.  Source              
              origins and degree of recent aerosol scavenging and free                       
              troposphere - boundary layer exchange will be assessed in                      
              conjunction with measurements made on other PSI platforms,                     
              meteorological analyses, and satellite observations.
