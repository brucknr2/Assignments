Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award to a cultural anthropologist and an ecologist at the                
              University of Southern California will support their research on               
              a complex irrigation system in Bali.  In a previous project the                
              PIs developed a computer simulation model of the irrigation                    
              system in a broad area, and analyzed the role of religious                     
              priests in managing the flow of water so as to coordinate the                  
              activities of different sub-regions to limit pest damage and                   
              stimulate increased rice production.  The model called for a vast              
              amount of precise data about the actual flows of water, rainfall,              
              crop production and other variables, and this award will allow                 
              the PIs to return to Bali to work with local water engineers and               
              personnel to set up a large program of data gathering.  The end                
              result will be a more precise test and specification of the                    
              model, which should allow local experts to manage the system                   
              better.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              This research is important because it shows the role of native                 
              religious specialists in economic production, and will help                    
              develop analytical systems to increase our understanding of the                
              function of regional irrigation systems in traditional societies.              
              Any increase in understanding of how such food production systems              
              work, especially when they are so different from our own (i.e.,                
              involving religious experts), can potentially help alleviate the               
              world food problem.
