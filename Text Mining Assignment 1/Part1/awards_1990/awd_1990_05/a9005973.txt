Abstract    :
              In this project supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and                   
              Organometallic Chemistry Program, Joseph M. O'Connor of the                    
              University of California, San Diego will continue studies in                   
              the area of organometallic research at the interface of                        
              metallacycle and carbene chemistry. This research directly                     
              impinges on the role of metal carbenes in alkene metathesis,                   
              alkene and alkyne polymerization, cyclopropanation chemistry                   
              and an impressive array of synthetic organic methodology.                      
                                                                                             
              The proposed research has its focus on iridium, rhodium and                    
              cobalt compounds and the development of new carbene coupling                   
              reactions wherein ring-expanded metallacycles of the above                     
              metals and ultimately four- and five-membered carbocycles would                
              be accessible. In addition to the synthetic studies, structural                
              and mechanistic studies will also be carried out.
