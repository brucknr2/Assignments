Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Description:  This project supports travel of ten U.S.                         
              scientists to the Internatrional Conference on the                             
              Mathematical Theory of Control, planned for December 10-14,                    
              1990 in Bombay, India.  The objectives of the meeting are: to                  
              make a comprehensive in-depth presentation of the current                      
              status of the mathematical theory of control, to discuss its                   
              potential in theory and application; and to discusss Indian                    
              scientists' participation in this area.  Topics to be                          
              included are: Pontryagin Maximum principle; Time-optimal                       
              control; Linear quadratic feedback control; Robot control                      
              dynamics; Control of large space structures; Stochastic                        
              control; Frequency domain theory; Infinite dimensional                         
              systems; Differential games; Adaptive control; Riccati                         
              equations; Controlability and observability; Computational                     
              techniques in optimal control; Nonlinear systems.                              
                                                                                             
              Scope:  This project supports participation of U.S.                            
              scientists in an international meeting where they and other                    
              participants from Europe and from India will exchange                          
              information on advances in the area of control.  This is an                    
              area of increasing importance to industrialized countries as                   
              well as developing countries.  The exchange of information is                  
              likely to benefit the U.S. participants by identifying                         
              potential collaborators from India.  It is clearly of benefit                  
              to India since the exposure to leaders in the field should                     
              stimulate research in the field.
