Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The result of the experiments will be new and original data on the             
              mechanisms of action of juvenile hormone (JH) suppress gene                    
              expression. The use of a protein which becomes highly expressed during         
              metamorphosis as the model for study ensures that the findings will            
              further our understanding of, and ability to disrupt, a fundamental and        
              developmentally critical point of regulation of insect development. The        
              occurrence and importance of JH in a wide range of invertebrate groups         
              ensures that the results will have wide significance and applicability         
              towards invertebrates.  It is also probable that the results of such           
              studies on juvenile hormone will have important implications for               
              studies on the action of retinoic acid in regulation of vertebrate gene        
              expression.
