Abstract    :
                      This project will assist NSF in compiling, standardizing and           
              analyzing updated data on the stock and employment of scientists               
              and engineers in the industrialized countries of France, the                   
              United Kingdom, West Germany, and Japan.  Foreign census and                   
              labor force data will be used to provide estimates of scientists               
              and engineers wherever possible by detailed fields and selected                
              characteristics such as sex, age, educational qualifications and               
              branch of economy and industry.                                                
                      The National Science Foundation has primary responsibility             
              within the Government for collecting and providing statistics                  
              and analysis of information on scientific and technical personnel              
              resources.  NSF has established a data base of such information                
              for four large industrialized countries--Japan, West Germany,                  
              France, and the United Kingdom (agreement number SRS-8813944) and              
              has started efforts to collect such data for selected additional               
              countries of Italy, Canada, Sweden, Taiwan and South Korea                     
              (agreement number SRS 8907725).  This project will make use of                 
              new data which is expected to become available during the next                 
              year to increase the data base and further enhance the analysis                
              of trends.  This type of information is sought by decisionmakers               
              in the pubic and private sectors and is needed for Congres-                    
              sionally mandated reports such as Science and Engineering                      
              Indicators as well as the increasingly important report                        
              International Science and Technology Data Update.
