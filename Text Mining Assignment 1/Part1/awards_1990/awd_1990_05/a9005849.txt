Abstract    :
              This is a collaborative research effort on fundamental problems                
              involved in the collection, communication and processing of                    
              distributed information and the coordination of distributed                    
              decision making.  The issues studied apply to social                           
              organizations such as economies, government agencies, and firms,               
              as well as to machine systems such as large scale control                      
              systems, distributed communications networks, and asynchronous                 
              parallel processing systems.  Engineers and economists both                    
              analyze these issues, although with different goals.  However,                 
              insights developed in each field are likely to be productive in                
              the other.  This is a program of research in areas of information              
              economics, parallel processing and machine learning, team theory,              
              control and estimation with distributed information, and the                   
              emergence of equilibrium behavior and allocations in large                     
              systems of interacting agents.  To increase the impact of this                 
              work, the researchers run an interdisciplinary workshop series on              
              coordination, information, and decisions.
