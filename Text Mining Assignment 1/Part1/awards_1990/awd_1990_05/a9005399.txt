Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project supports a cultural anthropologist examining the                  
              nature of the peasant family in early modern Japan (1600-1868).                
              Using a variety of historic demographic data, surveys of memorial              
              tablets and other tombstones, the investigator will try to                     
              establish when the "stem" family system became prevalent in                    
              Japan.                                                                         
                                                                                             
              This research is important because the history of Japan since the              
              Seventeenth Century has been one of impressive economic and                    
              political growth.  This growth has been supported by peasant                   
              agriculture, and understanding just how these sector of society                
              functioned will help us explain the pattern of Japanese history,               
              and thus perhaps smooth the course of development for other, less              
              developed nations.
