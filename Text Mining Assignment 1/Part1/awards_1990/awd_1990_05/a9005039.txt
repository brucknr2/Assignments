Abstract    :
                   Kyanite-bearing mineral assemblages are rare in the Archean               
              where high-grade plutonic-metamorphic terranes tend to be                      
              dominated by low-pressure high-temperature metamorphic regimes.                
              This has led to speculations regarding higher geothermal                       
              gradients in the Archean and has restricted analogies between                  
              high-grade Archean terranes and younger terranes with established              
              relationships to convergent margin plate tectonic settings.  This              
              work will expand on a study of Archean rocks in the Quetico                    
              subprovince of northeastern Minnesota where kyanite is present                 
              and a plate tectonic model has been developed.  The objective is               
              to determine the relationship of deformation and metamorphism in               
              the deep crustal level to adjacent shallower levels of the belt                
              exposed to the east.  Results are expected to clarify Archean                  
              plate settings and the nature of the Archean geothermal gradient.
