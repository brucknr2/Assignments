Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The proposal describes the continuing development of solid                     
              state NMR techniques to determine high resolution protein and                  
              polypeptide structure and dynamics in anisotropic environments.                
              Examples of the analytical determination of backbone torsion                   
              angles and a detailed description of a spatial model of                        
              backbone motions are described.  Further refinement of our                     
              knowledge of the magnitudes and orientations of nuclear spin                   
              interactions is described herein.  The utilization of new spin                 
              interactions and methods for taking optimal advantage of                       
              orientational constraints are discussed.  A new approach for                   
              achieving a detailed spatial model for local motions and an                    
              analysis of relaxation data in light of the spatial model are                  
              described.  Finally, a unified approach for resolving the                      
              structural and dynamic information from all of the                             
              spectroscopic data is detailed.***
