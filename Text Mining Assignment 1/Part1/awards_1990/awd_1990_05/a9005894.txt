Abstract    :
              This proposal requests funds for the purchase of an electronic                 
              area detector diffractometer for use in x-ray crystallographic                 
              studies of protein structures.  It is an updated version of the                
              proposal originally submitted Dec. 9, 1986.                                    
                                                                                             
              Proteins currently being investigated include a variety of                     
              complexes and mutants of E. coli, chicken and human dihydrofolate              
              reductase, and mutants and complexes of yeast cytochrome c                     
              peroxidase.  Additionally, crystals of two proteins relevant to                
              DNA replication and repair have been crystallized and are being                
              studied to establish their suitability for structure                           
              determination: repA1 of an E. coli plasmid and rat B-ploymerase.               
              Still other proteins are undergoing crystallization trials.                    
                                                                                             
              Acquisition of an area detector diffractometer will allow the PIs              
              to collect data when crystals are ready for mounting and                       
              eliminate the need to wait, often several months, for access to a              
              diffractometer in another laboratory; enhance the rate and                     
              flexibility of data collection; permit complete data sets to be                
              collected from a minimum number of crystals; and provide accurate              
              high-resolution data for structure refinement.
