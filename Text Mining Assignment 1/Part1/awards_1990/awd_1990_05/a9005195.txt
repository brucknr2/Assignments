Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The object of this study is the investigation of the                           
              conformational dynamics of components of protein biosynthesis                  
              systems from bacterial and higher organisms.  Specifically,                    
              elongation factors from c. coli and from calf brain will be                    
              studied both in isolated forms and in complexes with                           
              appropriate components from their respective protein                           
              biosynthesis systems.  In the case of the E. coli protein, the                 
              complexes will be the guanine nucleotide bound forms, the                      
              heterodimer formed with still another elongation factor, the                   
              ternary complex formed with guanine nucleotide and                             
              aminoacylated-tRNA and the complex formed with the antibiotic                  
              aurodox.  The elongation factor from calf brain will also be                   
              studied in its complexes with guanine nucleotides and with                     
              other elongation factors.  The goal of these studies will be                   
              to examine the nature and extent of the conformational                         
              alterations which occur upon formation of these various                        
              biologically important complexes as well as to elucidate                       
              hydrodynamic aspects of the complexes.  In addition to                         
              providing information on these important components of protein                 
              biosynthesis systems the proposed studies will also have                       
              relevance to related research on other quinine nucleotide                      
              binding proteins.
