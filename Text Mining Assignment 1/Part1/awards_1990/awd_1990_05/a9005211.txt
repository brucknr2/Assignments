Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A complete developmental and molecular analysis of the 1(2)Cf                  
              (Cf) gene in Drosophila melanogaster will be carried out.  Cf                  
              mutations produce brain hemispheres 5-10x the normal size in late              
              3rd instar larvae without affecting the ventral ganglion.  Cf                  
              brain tissue when transplanted into wild type adult hosts becomes              
              tumorous and malignant.  The cloned gene is located within 46kb                
              of the dopa decarboxylase gene and is part of the Ddc gene                     
              cluster which is involved in catecholamine metabolism and                      
              scleroticizaton of the cuticle.  Cf mutations also produce a                   
              weakened cuticle phenotype in pharate adults and are cell lethals              
              in adult epidermis.                                                            
                                                                                             
              Sequencing of the cloned gene will be completed and the derived                
              amino acid sequence examined to determine the nature of the                    
              protein and its possible function.  Homology to vertebrate genes,              
              some of which may be potential tumor suppressor genes, will be                 
              sought.  To investigate Cf's role in development, the                          
              distribution of its mRNA and protein in tissue sections will be                
              examined.  Definitive answers will be sought by studying two                   
              aspects of neurogenesis, cell proliferation and differentiation,               
              in mutant and control flies in vivo.                                           
                                                                                             
              The Cf+ gene product may be involved in a specific step in                     
              catecholamine metabolism which would implicate a catecholamine                 
              derivative not only as a factor in scleroticization of the                     
              cuticle but also as a specific neural cell growth regulator in                 
              the CNS.  To investigate this possibility a survey of biogenic                 
              amine pools throughout development and in specific tissue of Cf                
              and wild type will be completed.
