Abstract    :
              This grant is in the general area of analytical and surface                    
              chemistry and in the subfield of laser excited photothermal                    
              spectroscopy.  Professor Bialkowski will study the nonlinear                   
              fundamental aspects of high intensity laser photothermal                       
              spectroscopy.  This grant will provide graduate student support                
              only.                                                                          
                                                                                             
              This research will use pulsed infrared laser irradiation of                    
              high intensity to quantify multiphoton absorption coefficients                 
              for samples in the gas phase.  This research will find                         
              application in the analysis of atmospheric chlorofluorocarbons                 
              in situ.
