Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This facility is being developed to measure fast transient                     
              photoconductivity with sub-picosecond resolution using electro-                
              optic sampling techniques.  The fast transient photoinduced                    
              conductivity of high temperature superconducting oxides will be                
              studied initially.  This facility will also permit measurements                
              in the sub-Picosecond time domain for the study of carrier                     
              generation recombination and transport in conducting polymers,                 
              and will allow measurements of superconducting transmission line               
              characteristics from a few gigahertz (GHz) to more than 200 GHz.
