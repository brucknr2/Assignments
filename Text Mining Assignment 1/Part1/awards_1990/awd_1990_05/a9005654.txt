Abstract    :
                   This research addresses the following critical issues related             
              to high-productivity tooling for automated machine tools:  (1)                 
              development of a data base on existing NC tooling systems and                  
              performance of an analytical survey; (2) comparative analysis of               
              commercially-available tooling systems; (3) conceptual development             
              of advanced tooling systems with enhanced structural and joint                 
              stiffness and damping; (4) conceptual development of improved                  
              tooling (and other machine tool-related) structures using                      
              anisotropic elastomeric composites; and (5) conceptual development             
              of automatic continuous balancing of high-rpm tooling.                         
                                                                                             
              The research effort is expected to result both in solution of                  
              important specific problems and contribute to the establishment of             
              a tooling/machine tool research center to facilitate technology                
              transfer to industry.
