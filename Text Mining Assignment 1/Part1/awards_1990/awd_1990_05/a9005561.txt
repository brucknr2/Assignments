Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The contractile protein tropomyosin is an important component of the           
              thin filament-linked contractile regulatory system.  The long-term goal        
              of this research program is to obtain a more detailed understanding of         
              the relationship between tropomyosin's primary structure and its role          
              in muscle cells.  The current proposal focuses on the functional               
              importance of specific amino acid residues in the C-terminal region of         
              tropomyosin, using Drosophila as a model system.  This work will               
              enhance our understanding of muscle structure and function.
