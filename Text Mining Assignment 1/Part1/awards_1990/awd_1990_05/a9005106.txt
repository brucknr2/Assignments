Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The recovery efforts from the impact of Hurricane Hugo on                      
              South Carolina will be examined.  The issues presented during                  
              the near-tern recovery will be identified; the influence of                    
              past experiences in hurricane recovery will be scrutinized;                    
              and the assumptions and expectations from federal, state,                      
              local public and private organizations made for the                            
              formulation of recovery plans will be compared with the actual                 
              recovery actions.  The result of this work will benefit                        
              natural hazards researchers, administrators, planners, the                     
              insurance industry, and other professionals dealing with                       
              natural disasters mitigation.
