Abstract    :
                   A group of institutes, centers, and universities                          
              throughout the country will sponsor a summer school in Santa                   
              Fe, New Mexico during June 1990.  The goal of the summer school                
              is to provide graduate students and postdoctoral fellows with                  
              an introduction to the study of "complex" behavior in                          
              mathematical, physical, and living systems.                                    
                   The themes for this year's summer school will be:  (i)                    
              the nature of chaos, disorder, or randomness in a variety of                   
              physical and mathematical systems; (ii)  pattern formation in                  
              physical, chemical and biological systems; and (iii)  cognition                
              and computational approaches to brain and cognitive function.                  
                   The four-week school will consist of short courses                        
              together with seminars, computer workshops, and laboratory                     
              projects supplementing the lectures.  The material presented at                
              the school is intended to be appropriate for advanced students                 
              with graduate-level training in the mathematical, physical,                    
              biological, or computer sciences and a strong mathematical                     
              background.
