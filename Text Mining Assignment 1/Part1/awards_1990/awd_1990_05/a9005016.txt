Abstract    :
              We will use genetic approaches to study the structure, function                
              and assembly of ribosomal RNA in E. coli.  The main feature of                 
              the method is to use antibiotic-resistance mutations in 16S and                
              23S rRNA as genetic markers.  This allows us to use both random                
              and site-directed mutagenesis approaches.  The construction of                 
              inducible rRNA operons allows us to identify lethal mutations, as              
              well.  Mutations that confer a variety of phenotypes, including                
              temperature-sensitive, cold-sensitive, "downs," nulls, Ram,                    
              suppressors, etc. will be isolated and localized by marker rescue              
              and DNA sequencing.  Second site revertants will also be sought,               
              in an effort to identify long-range structural and functional                  
              interactions involving ribosomal RNA.
