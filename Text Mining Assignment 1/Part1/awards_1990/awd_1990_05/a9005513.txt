Abstract    :
                This research is to analyze existing digital seismic data sets               
              for further evidence of a strong P-velocity anomaly in the lower               
              mantle beneath the northern Soviet Union and, if possible, to                  
              map its spatial extent.  Although considerable SH data show                    
              evidence of anomalous structure up to 350 km above the core-                   
              mantle boundary, to this date only European WWSSN data and the                 
              GRF array have been searched successfully to find the P-wave                   
              analog produced by such an anomaly.  The results should give                   
              information on what kind of structure is giving rise to the                    
              anomalous observations which can, in turn, constrain dynamical                 
              models of the mantle and core.
