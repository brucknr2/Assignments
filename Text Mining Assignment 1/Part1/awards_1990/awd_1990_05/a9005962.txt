Abstract    :
              Funds are requested to purchase state-of-the-art plant growth                  
              chambers.  The incubators will provide space to enable four                    
              different investigators to proceed with work involving plant                   
              molecular genetics.  All of the projects require rearing                       
              considerable numbers of plants under completely controlled                     
              conditions and two occasionally need isolation as viral and viroid             
              pathogens are used.  Growth chamber space presently available is               
              completely inadequate to support these projects.
