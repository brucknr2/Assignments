Abstract    :
              This award is for partial support of a workshop to discuss the                 
              current state of the art in site characterization for the reduction            
              of disasters' toll.  The workshop will be held at the University               
              of California, Davis on March 29 and 30, 1990.  The workshop will              
              formulate and document research needs in a number of problem areas,            
              such as swelling, frost heave, contaminant migration, earthquake               
              effects on soils, and offshore siting problems.  The results of                
              the workshop will be used to develop a collaborative proposal for              
              the creation of a research center on "Site Characterization for                
              Reducing Disaster' Toll.
