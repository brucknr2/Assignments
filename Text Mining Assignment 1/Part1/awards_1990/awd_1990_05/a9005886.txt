Abstract    :
              The ImmC and ImmI regions of the closely related, but heteroimmune,            
              phages P1 and P7 code for regulatory proteins involved in directing            
              the phage toward lytic or lysogenic growth.  Within ImmC, c1 codes             
              for a repressor of lytic gene expression, while coi codes for an               
              antagonist of c1 repressor activity.  The c4 repressor, encoded                
              within ImmI, prevents expression of ant, a closely linked gene                 
              whose product interferes with c1-mediated repression.  Differences             
              in c4 specificity are responsible for the heteroimmune character               
              of P1 and P7.  Regulation of gene expression within ImmC and ImmI              
              will be investigated by monitoring the expression of lacZ from                 
              transcriptional fusions in the presence of compatible plasmids                 
              coding for phage regulatory proteins.  The regulatory role played              
              by multiple c1 operator sites within ImmC will be investigated by              
              in vitro mutagenesis and DNase protection studies.  Mutations in               
              c1 that suppress the virulent phenotype caused by Coi                          
              overproduction will also be sought.  The contribution to                       
              heteroimmune specificity of sequence differences within P1ImmI and             
              P7 ImmI will be investigated by assaying the effect of c4 and ant              
              expression on transcription within these regions, and within the               
              downstream region containing the lytic replicon.//
