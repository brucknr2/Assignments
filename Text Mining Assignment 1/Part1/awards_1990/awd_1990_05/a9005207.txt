Abstract    :
                   The PI will analysis and interpretation of the EMSLAB                     
              magnetometer array.  Existing, but recently developed methods of               
              analysis, including robust multivariate transfer function (or                  
              response space) estimates; methods for combining non-simultaneous              
              arrays (and treating missing data in a large array); a new method              
              for combining all components of the transfer functions to produce              
              smooth maps of magnetic fields of internal origin and methods for              
              approximate (almost linear) inversion of long period anomalous                 
              magnetic field data for integrated surface conductance, will be                
              applied to the 83 station land array.
