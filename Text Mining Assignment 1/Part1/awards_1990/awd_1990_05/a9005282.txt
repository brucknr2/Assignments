Abstract    :
              The small proteglycans are major components of bone, skin,                     
              tendon, cartilage and other connective tissues as well as being                
              vital to cell: matrix interactions.  It has been demonstrated                  
              that the small proteglycan II of bone binds to the "D" bands                   
              of the gap region of type I collagen fibrils and controls the                  
              rate of formation and the final size of these fibers.  It is                   
              not known which region of the PGII of bovine bone has been                     
              cloned and sequenced.  Therefore, the gene encoding PGII will                  
              be isolated, the intron/exon structure determined and the                      
              regulatory motifs (promoter, enhancers) identified and                         
              characterized.  The process of isolation will involve "gene                    
              walking", or utilizing sequences of one genomic clone to                       
              isolate and identify another.  These overlapping clones will                   
              be mapped in detail using restriction endonucleases and                        
              synthetic oligonucleotides.  The 5' donor and 3' acceptor                      
              splice sites for intron/exon boundaries will be identified,                    
              isolated and sequenced.  Exon specific nucleotide sequences                    
              will be utilized to make synthetic peptides.  These peptides                   
              will then be utilized to determine the locations of specific                   
              activities of the various regions of the protein (i.e. collagen                
              binding sites).  The promoter will be utilized in                              
              transformation studies of cultured bone (PGII  protein                         
              producing) and kidney (non-producing) cells in the absence and                 
              presence of estrogen, vitamin D and phorbol esters.  Results                   
              of these studies will identify specific structural and                         
              functional domains of the protein, and provide a means by which                
              the regulation of expression of the PGII gene can be                           
              studied.***
