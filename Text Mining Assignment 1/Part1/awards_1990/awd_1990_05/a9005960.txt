Abstract    :
              Professors Thomas Hayden and Judith Shelling are jointly                       
              supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational                    
              Chemistry Program, the Applied Mathematics Program, and the                    
              Division of Instrumentation and Resources to develop new                       
              approaches to the determination of macromolecular structure in                 
              solution through the use of 2-D NMR and distance geometry.                     
              This research will provide important new insights into                         
              biological structural problems.                                                
                                                                                             
              Professors Hayden and Shelling will develop improved                           
              computational algorithms for finding the coordinates of points                 
              in Euclidean space that generate distances which approximate                   
              those found experimentally from NMR spectroscopy.  Recent                      
              advances in the theory and geometry of distance matrices have                  
              resulted in efficient algorithms for solving this problem.                     
              Additional algorithms based on these theoretical results will                  
              be investigated, and these algorithms will then be applied to                  
              the determination of conformations of molecules of biological                  
              interest.
