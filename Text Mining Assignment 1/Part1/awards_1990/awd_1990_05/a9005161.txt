Abstract    :
                   This research is to study the attenuation and velocity                    
              structure of back-arc regions using teleseismic body waves and                 
              the effects of shallow structure on earthquake body waveforms.                 
              The deep structure beneath spreading centers in the back-arc                   
              provides important constraints on the dynamics of the spreading                
              process.  Attenuation and velocity anomalies in the vicinity of                
              the rift will be measured by comparing sS and sScS phases with                 
              direct S and ScS waveforms which have similar paths through the                
              lower mantle to the receiver.  The effect of near-source                       
              bathymetric and structural complexities will also be                           
              investigated.
