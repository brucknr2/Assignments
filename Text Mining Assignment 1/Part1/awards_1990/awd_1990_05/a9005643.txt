Abstract    :
              The goals of this research are to define the sequence and                      
              structural elements of transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNA)                        
              required for its recognition by proteins.  Of particular                       
              interest is the recognition of E. coli  tRNA for amino acid                    
              valine (tRNAVa1) by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and by the tRNA                 
              modifying enzyme, tRNA (uracil-5-)methyltransferase. Detailed                  
              understanding of these interactions will clarify questions                     
              concerning the fidelity of protein synthesis, the mechanisms                   
              of tRNA modification, and the role of modified nucleosides in                  
              tRNA function.  The elements of tRNAVa1 essential for its                      
              recognition by valyl-tRNA synthetase (VRS) will be determined                  
              by examining the kinetics of reaction of tRNAVa1 variants.                     
              Minimal requirements for synthetase recognition will be                        
              explored with tRNA fragments containing the essential recog-                   
              nition elements of tRNAVa1.  The structure of these mutant                     
              tRNAs will be probed by 19F NMR spectroscopy of tRNAVa1 labe-                  
              led with fluorine.  Fluorinated tRNAVa1 is ideally suited for                  
              such studies because it remains fully functional and contains                  
              highly sensitive 19F probes distributed throughout all the                     
              helical stems and the loops of the tRNA molecule where they                    
              can serve to monitor local structural                                          
              changes.
