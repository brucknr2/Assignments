Abstract    :
              The PIs will analyze the Re-Os isotopic systematics of Archean                 
              komatiites and tonalites-granodiorites; mafic layered intrusions;              
              mantle xenoliths; and recent basalts from mid-ocean ridges, ocean              
              islands and island arcs.  The specific goals of these studies are              
              to determine the Os isotopic mantle growth curve; to determine                 
              the source of cratonic core rocks; to understand the behavior of               
              Re and Os in igneous systems; to study the formation of the                    
              subcontinental mantle and to investigate recycling of oceanic                  
              crust within the upper mantle and the role of oceanic crust in                 
              island arc volcanism.                                                          
              The Re-Os isotopic system has unique potential to contribute to                
              geochemical studies of the Earth.  This system provides new                    
              information complementary to that available from the Rb-Sr, SM-Nd              
              and U-Th-Pb systems for several reasons:  both Re and Os are                   
              siderophile elements, Os is compatible in the mantle while Re                  
              generally is incompatible, Os has a relatively high abundance in               
              the mantle compared to the crust and the melting events that                   
              form basaltic rocks strongly fractionate Os from Re.  The use of               
              the Re-Os isotopic system will provide a greater understanding of              
              the depleted and enriched reservoirs of the convecting mantle and              
              the lithosphere, the creation of ancient continental crust with                
              its lithospheric roots and the role of subducted slab components               
              at convergent margins.
