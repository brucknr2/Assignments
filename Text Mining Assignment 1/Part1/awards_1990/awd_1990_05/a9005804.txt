Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator is working on problems in                      
              probability theory concerning the law of the iterated logarithms               
              (LIL) and strong approximations.  In particular, the                           
              investigator will work on convergence rates in the LIL in Hilbert              
              spaces, infinite dimensional versions of the Darling-Erdos                     
              theorem and Chung type LIL's, and strong approximations for sums               
              of independent Banach space value random variables.                            
                   Properties of sums of independent random variables have                   
              been of interest to probabilists and statisticians for a long                  
              time.  The law of the iterated logarithm gives a very precise                  
              bound on how fast a sum of random variables grows.
