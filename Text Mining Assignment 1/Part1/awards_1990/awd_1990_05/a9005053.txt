Abstract    :
              This is for continuation of a long-term study of the petrogenesis              
              of lavas from Central American volcanoes.  The PIs have been able              
              to correlate chemistry with thickness and dip of the slab.  They               
              will now try to:  1) characterize their postulated four sources                
              for multi component mixing, 2) analyze for Cs in the slab-derived              
              fluid, 3) attempt to determine regional variations in the mantle               
              through modelling, and 4) map the distribution of the slab                     
              component in regions of diffuse, behind-the-front volcanism.
