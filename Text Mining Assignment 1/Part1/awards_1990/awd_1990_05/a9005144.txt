Abstract    :
                   Drs. Russell Graham (Illinois State Museum) and Ernest                    
              Lundelius (Texas Memorial Museum) propose to construct a database              
              of late Ice Age Fossil mammals from the United States.  Data on                
              species identities, age, rock types, preservation, and                         
              paleonenvironmental data will be compiled from literature sources              
              and museum collections, and will be entered into the Illinois                  
              State Museum's Geographic Information System.  Ten regional                    
              coordinators (plus four Canadians working on a similar project)                
              will review the data quality and will participate in yearly                    
              workshops to oversee the project.                                              
                   Once established, the proposed database will have tremendous              
              impact in vertebrate paleontology, paleoecology, and the critical              
              fields relating to the Global Change Initiative, such as climate               
              dynamics, conservation biology, and ecological responses to                    
              climatic change.  This database will be available to a wide                    
              variety of investigators who will come to rely on it as a                      
              taxonomic resource, as a test for climate models, and as a                     
              growing resource for interdisciplinary research.
