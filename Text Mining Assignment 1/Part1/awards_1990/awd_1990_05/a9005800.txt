Abstract    :
                   This research will test the idea that a distinctive fauna of              
              ancient, endemic, specialized invertebrates lives in the                       
              groundwaters of unglaciated Mesozoic terrain in eastern North                  
              America.  The existence of such a fauna is to be expected based                
              on the distribution of the faunas of caves and surface waters in               
              eastern North America.  This idea will be tested by analyzing the              
              invertebrate communities of shallow groundwater (the hyporheic                 
              zone) at 15-20 sites between the Canadian border and the Gulf of               
              Mexico.  The results of this research will help to answer                      
              questions about several important topics, including:  (i) the                  
              zoogeography and evolution of the groundwater fauna; (ii) the                  
              ecological structure and function of groundwater communities of                
              different evolutionary ages;  (iii) interactions between epigean               
              generalists and hypogean specialists in groundwater communities;               
              (iv) predicting the response of groundwater communities to global              
              climate change; (v) predicting the response of groundwater                     
              communities to catastrophic disturbance; and (vi) elucidating the              
              evolutionary and physiological ecology of groundwater                          
              invertebrates.  The project will contribute to the basic ecology               
              of groundwater communities, an area of major interest among                    
              ecologists, and will add to the knowledge base useful for applied              
              science.
