Abstract    :
              The long range goal of this research is to elucidate the                       
              molecular and cellular mechanisms by which the phytohormone                    
              ethylene regulates development in higher plants, specifically the              
              activation of genes during ethylene-induced ripening of fruit.  A              
              number of ripening-induced genes including a cytochrome P-450                  
              oxidase have been identified.  This ripening-induced P-450 is the              
              first plant P-450 to be characterized at the molecular level and               
              is designated cyp71A1.  The functional role of the cytochrome P-               
              450 in ripening fruit is unknown and is one of the primary                     
              objectives of the research proposed.  In addition, cellular and                
              genetic regulatory elements responsible for P-450 gene activation              
              during ripening are being identified.  The specific objectives                 
              are: (1) characterize the substrate specificity of the cyp71A1                 
              gene product in a heterologous expression system, (2) identify                 
              the cis-acting elements that confer ethylene regulation on the                 
              cyp71A1 gene through transient expression assays of modified                   
              promoter/reporter constructs, and (3) characterize potential                   
              trans-acting factors which specifically bind to the upstream                   
              elements of the cyp71A1 gene.                                                  
                                                                                             
              This research begins to unravel the series of biochemical events               
              leading to ripening in avocado.  Ripening is a poorly understood               
              process of enormous economic importance in agriculture, as well                
              as an excellent model system for how hormones affect genes                     
              espression.
