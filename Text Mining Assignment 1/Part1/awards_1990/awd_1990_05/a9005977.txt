Abstract    :
                   This research is concerned with problems in algebraic                     
              geometry. The principal investigator will continue his study of                
              motivic cohomology and establishing connections with algebraic                 
              K-theory and the values of Dedekind zeta functions. There are                  
              possible applications to the Soule-Beilinson conjecture and                    
              related topics which will also be explored.                                    
                   This is research in the field of algebraic geometry, one                  
              of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which has                   
              had a revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century. In                  
              its origins, it treated figures that could be defined in the                   
              plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials. Nowadays                  
              the field makes use of methods not only from algebra, but from                 
              analysis and topology, and conversely is finding application in                
              those fields as well as in theoretical computer science and                    
              robotics.
