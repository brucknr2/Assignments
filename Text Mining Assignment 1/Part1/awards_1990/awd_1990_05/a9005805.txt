Abstract    :
                   This is a grant under the Scientific Computing Research                   
              Equipment for the Mathematical Sciences program of the Division                
              of Mathematical Sciences of the National Sciences Foundation.                  
              This program supports the purchase of special purpose computing                
              equipment dedicated to the conduct of research in the                          
              mathematical sciences.  This equipment is required for several                 
              research projects and would be difficult to justify for one                    
              project alone.  Support from the National Science Foundation is                
              coupled with discounts and contributions from manufacturers and                
              with substantial cost-sharing from the institutions submitting                 
              the proposal.  This program is an example of academic,                         
              corporate, and government cooperation in the support of the basic              
              research in the mathematical sciences.                                         
                   This equipment will be used to support five research                      
              projects in the Program in Applied Mathematics of the University               
              of Colorado, Boulder: aspects of solutions, integrable systems,                
              and computation, directed by Mark Ablowitz; iterative methods for              
              the solution of nonlinear equations, directed by James Curry;                  
              discrete dynamical systems, directed by Robert Easton; dynamics                
              of Hamitonian mappings, directed by James Meiss; the Kadomtsev-                
              Petviashvili equation and water waves, directed by Harvey Segur.
