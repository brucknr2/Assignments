Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Polysphondylium pallidum is a cellular slime mold that forms                   
              distinctive spatial patterns during its like cycle. One of these               
              patterns, the radial arrangement of spore-bearing arms about a                 
              central stalk, arises from a spheroidal mass of cells at the base              
              of the developing organism. The emergence of the radial                        
              patterning from a spheroidal one is a true symmetry breaking                   
              event which Dr. Cox proposes to study in cellular and molecular                
              detail by examining the structure and function of the genes                    
              involved. The genes coding for patterning elements will be                     
              studied by conventional cloning techniques and used to guess at                
              possible functions; to study the timing and regulation of their                
              transcripts; and to use them in antisense constructs and gene                  
              disruption experiments to ask whether or not the gene products                 
              are essential for development and morphogenesis. The long range                
              goal of this research is a complete cellular understanding of                  
              morphogenesis in this simple system, with a view to relating the               
              various contributions made by cell-cell signaling and physical                 
              interaction, the roles played by diffusible chemical signals, and              
              the possible contribution to the process of forces such as cell                
              movement, surface tension, and tissue deformation.
