Abstract    :
                   Considerable motivation exists to study processes that govern             
              the abundance and distribution of rock debris at the base of ice               
              masses because they figure importantly in the dynamics and                     
              geomorphic manifestations of glaciers and ice sheets.  The proposed            
              work is aimed at better understanding how erosional processes                  
              operate to generate and modify debris at the glacier bed, and how              
              transport processes mix, disperse and eventually eliminate this                
              debris.  Researchers will complete a theoretical model of glacial              
              quarrying and refine a new model of abrasion, which provides for               
              the first time a quantitative link between all major processes                 
              governing both the erosion of bedrock and the abundance of basal               
              debris.  Then, armed with new model results about quarrying of                 
              debris from the bed and particle/bed interactions, it is possible              
              to re-analyse considerable published data on glacial drift,                    
              including dispersal patterns, spatial variations in grain size, and            
              particle textures reflecting wear and fracture.  The physical                  
              insight and quantification gained from the models will shed                    
              significant new light on the genesis of glacial debris, and lead               
              to more precise inferences about the behavior of unlithified                   
              material at the base of ice sheets and glaciers than has been                  
              previously possible.                                                           
                   The proposed research is a natural extension of the work                  
              nearly completed on large-scale glacial erosion, with funds from               
              ERA87-08400.  This study provides a firm foundation for the                    
              proposed refinement of our erosion analysis, and its application               
              to the glaciological interpretation of key characteristics of                  
              glacial sediments.
