Abstract    :
                   An experimental investigation of attenuation and deformation-             
              induced melt migration in texturally equilibrated silicate partial             
              melts will be carried out.  The experiments analyses will                      
              concentrate (i) on directly measuring the attenuation response in              
              model partial melts that is uniquely attributable to stress-induced            
              motion of the melt and (ii) on measuring the materials properties              
              (i.e., matrix viscosities, melt viscosity, melt permeability)                  
              required for geodynamical models of melt migration.  The key to                
              these measurements is the use of flexural loading, which creates               
              an analytically determinant stress gradient within a specimen.
