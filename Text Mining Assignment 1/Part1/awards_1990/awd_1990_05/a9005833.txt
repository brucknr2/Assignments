Abstract    :
                   This group of investigators will be supported under the                   
              Mathematical Sciences Research Group mode of funding.  The group               
              is involved in the formulation and solution of analytical                      
              problems in molecular biology and genetics.  In particular, the                
              group will emphasize the development and application of                        
              mathematical, statistical and computational methods for the                    
              analysis of DNA, RNA and protein sequences.  The research is                   
              organized into four main areas.  (1)  In the development of                    
              mathematical tools for molecular biology, the investigators will               
              study protein sequence analysis, physical mapping, and                         
              statistical tests for pattern analysis.  (2) Computational                     
              algorithms will be developed for database searches, sequence                   
              alignment, and sequence assembly.  (3)  Ongoing work in                        
              mathematical population genetics includes studies of genealogical              
              trees, the finite sites models and genealogy and selection.  The               
              group will also analyze some statistical problems in molecular                 
              evolution.  (4)  The group will continue to study the stochastic               
              properties of optimal sequence comparisons.  This work is closely              
              related to the Chen-Stein method of Poisson approximation, which               
              has application to many probabilistic problems.  Other work                    
              focusses on random permutations an change point problems.                      
                   This Mathematical Sciences Research Group will investigate                
              problems at the interface of molecular biology and genetics,                   
              statistics and probability, and computation.  The investigators                
              on this grant interact with each other and with many biologists.               
              The problems investigated by this group are directly motivated by              
              biological considerations, and mathematical and computational                  
              solutions of these problems will impact all the fields involved.
