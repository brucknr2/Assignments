Abstract    :
              The project's goal is to use a new approach to simplify the                    
              kinetic and thermodynamic study of human erythrocyte glucose-6-                
              phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) that involves the control of the                
              enzyme's state of association.  G6PD is a key enzyme in the                    
              hexosemonophosphate pathway and over 370 genetic variants of the               
              human erythrocyte enzyme have been identified. Individuals with                
              G6PD deficiencies can suffer hemolytic crisis on exposure to a                 
              variety of drugs or foods.  The large number of genetic variants,              
              many with reduced activity, mae G6PD an attractive target for                  
              cloning and sequencing.  The interpretation of the changes in                  
              amino acid sequence are dependent on the measurement of G6PD's                 
              biochemical properties.  Unfortunately, there is a lack of                     
              agreement on many of the basic enzymatic properties of                         
              erythrocyte G6PD, namely, the binding of substrates and the                    
              effect of intercellular molecules on the enzyme's kinetics.  In                
              analogy with prior work on yeast G6PD, this proposal's hypothesis              
              is past kinetic and thermodynamic studies of human erythrocyte                 
              G6PD measured the properties of a mixture of G6PD dimers and                   
              tetramers, each of which may have different biochemical                        
              properties.  This lack of agreement concerning human erythrocyte               
              G6PD's biochemical properties would arise because the relative                 
              amounts of G6PD dimers and tetramers changed during the kinetic                
              or thermodynamic measurements.  Thus                                           
              proposal will focus upon measuring the biochemical properties of               
              the G6PD dimer, the form presumed to be present in the                         
              erythrocyte.  The three specific aims of the RUI proposal are (1)              
              to measure the number of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide                     
              phosphate (NADP) and glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) molecules bound                 
              to G6PD and the magnitude of the association constant for these                
              two molecules. The project will directly measure the equilibrium               
              quantity of radioactively labeled  G6P, or NADP, bound to the                  
              enzyme.  The proposal will also (2) quantitatively study the                   
              inhibition of erythrocyte G6PD kinetics by ATP and 2,3                         
              diphosphoglycerate, two proposed physiologically important                     
              inhibitors of G6PD.  The third (3) specific aim will measure the               
              dimertetramer association constant using large zone (plateau)                  
              HPLC experiments on a size exclusion column.
