Abstract    :
              A workshop entitled Spliceosome Assembly and Alternative                       
              RNA Splicing will be held in France in September.  The                         
              meeting is being organized under the aegis of the                              
              European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO) and will                        
              be limited to 70-90 participants, at least half of whom                        
              will be Americans.                                                             
                                                                                             
              A great variety of cellular and viral genes rely on a                          
              regulated program of alternative splicing for appropriate                      
              tissue and stage-specific gene expression.  This meeting                       
              will focus on the molecular mechanisms of regulated                            
              alternative splicing and, as such, is the first to be                          
              devoted to this important level of gene regulation.                            
              Rapid preliminary progress is now being made in                                
              understanding the biochemistry of alternative splicing                         
              in a number of specific systems.  Three sessions of the                        
              meeting will focus on new developments in splice site                          
              selection and four sessions will deal with the mechanisms                      
              of alternative splicing in viruses and cellular genes.                         
              The meeting will end with a workshop on practical aspects                      
              of establishing tissue-specific splicing extracts, so                          
              that the systems can be studied and manipulated in vitro.
