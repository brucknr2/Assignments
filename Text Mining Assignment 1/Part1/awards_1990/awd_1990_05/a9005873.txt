Abstract    :
                   This project is concerned with research in commutative                    
              algebra. The principal investigator will determine conditions                  
              for an ideal to be in the linkage class of a complete                          
              intersection and will show that certain normal ideals are                      
              set-theoretic complete intersections. The Cohen-Macaulay                       
              property of residual intersections will also be examined.                      
                   One goal in the study of commutative rings is to                          
              classify ideals having certain properties. Many of these                       
              results have applications to problems in algebraic geometry.                   
              An interesting topic is whether an ideal related by linkage                    
              to another ideal shares any of the second ideal's interesting                  
              properties, or to what extent it does so. This latter problem                  
              is the primary concern of this project.
