Abstract    :
              This project will develop petrogenetic constraints for the origin              
              and evolution of basalts from the Albertine rift.  It will                     
              involve field relations, major and trace elements and phenocryst               
              compositions in collab with radiometric (K-Ar) age dates, Sr and               
              He isotope data, and gravity and seismic studies.  The goal is to              
              determine thermal and geochemical characteristics of the mantle                
              beneath this part of central Africa.  What is the petrogenesis of              
              alkalic (ultra-Potassic) basalts?
