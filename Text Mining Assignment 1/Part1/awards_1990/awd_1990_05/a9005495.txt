Abstract    :
                   Compressional and extensional stages accompanying                         
              continental margin tectonics are commonly sequential and may be                
              linked by underlying processes.  Recent field and laboratory                   
              studies indicate that the high-grade metamorphism in the Darwin                
              complex of the Andes of Terra del Fuego accompanied crustal                    
              thickening that resulted from the inversion of the Rocas Verdes                
              marginal basin by obduction of the basin floor onto the South                  
              American continent.  The uplift resulted from tectonic denudation              
              of the overthickened crust in the latest Cretaceous or earliest                
              Cenozoic.  This project will involve a test of this hypothesis                 
              by assembly of a structural transect across Cordillera Darwin and              
              development of a model for the evolution of the southernmost                   
              Andes in relation to their plate tectonic setting.
