Abstract    :
              The research supported under this grant is the continuation of a               
              very successful joint project of R. Weymann and S. Morris of the               
              Carnegie Institution of Washington and C. Foltz, C. Impey, and F.              
              Chaffee of the University of Arizona.  These investigators, widely             
              considered to be world leaders in their field, will complete an                
              optical survey of over 1000 bright quasars using broadly based and             
              quantifiable selection criteria.  This new observational material              
              will be used to make a number of studies not previously possible.              
              Among these will be a probe of a very large supercluster of                    
              absorbers lying in front of several quasars, studies of the                    
              relationship between radio and optical power in quasars, and                   
              investigations of possible links between nonthermal optical                    
              properties of quasars and their VLBI radio emission.
