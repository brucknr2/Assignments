Abstract    :
              This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the work                 
              of Dr. Alex Nickon at the Johns Hopkins University.  This                      
              investigation will afford new insights into the structure and                  
              reactivity of highly reactive chemical intermediates.                          
                                                                                             
              The experiments that will be carried out by Dr. Nickon will                    
              center on rearrangements of carbenes to alkenes.  The study                    
              will employ reactants that are doubly labelled with carbon and                 
              deuterium to evaluate stereoelectronic requirements for the                    
              rearrangements.  The research will also focus on the                           
              photochemical rearrangement of alkenes to carbenes, a process                  
              that is the reverse of the normally observed pathway.  This                    
              rearrangement is believed to proceed via Rydberg excited                       
              states, which may have partially twisted geometries.  This                     
              reaction of strained reactants may provide a method for direct                 
              access to anti-pyramidalized alkenes.
