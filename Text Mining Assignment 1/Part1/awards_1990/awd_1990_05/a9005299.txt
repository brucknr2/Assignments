Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              It has been shown previously that the functional state of                      
              UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (GT) is determined in part by the                  
              lipid environment.  Evidence obtained in the last grant                        
              period suggests that GT is an oligomer regulated by protein-                   
              protein interactions, which are modulated in turn by the                       
              lipids at the annulus.  Moreover, it appears that the                          
              organization of protein-protein interactions as well as the                    
              distribution of lipids in untreated microsomes, which                          
              constrain the maximal activity of GT, is not the                               
              thermodynamically most stable state of microsomes.  This                       
              metastable organization and associated constraint on the                       
              activity of microsomal enzymes seem to be general properties                   
              of microsomal enzymes in that two other enzymes studied                        
              behave like GT.  This study establishes the validity of the                    
              above ideas via detailed studies of GT, glucose-6-Pase, and                    
              acylCoA ligase in microsomes and in pure, reconstituted                        
              systems.  If current studies establish that pure GT is an                      
              oligomer the conditions under which it dissociates will be                     
              determined to establish the factors that account for                           
              constaint and organization in intact microsomes.  Independent                  
              of these results ongoing studies are being conducted on the                    
              influence of the lipid environment on the functional state                     
              and stability of GT.                                                           
                                                                                             
              This research is fundamental to our understanding of the                       
              organization and function of membrane proteins as well as the                  
              role of lipids in modulating the behavior of these proteins.                   
              Progress in this area will have an impact on basic cellular                    
              biology, biochemistry and pathobiology.***//
