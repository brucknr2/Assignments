Abstract    :
              This study is to document the scale of thermal, fluid-                         
              circulation, and metasomatic effects around a distinctively                    
              volatile-and rare-element-rich synmetamorphic graite-the 1.7 Ga                
              Harney Peak Granite in the Black Hills, South Dakota.  The                     
              primary data base will consist of 40 samples of pelitic rocks                  
              ranging in metamorphic grade from the biotite through the                      
              sillimanite zone. The sample traverse will be confined to a                    
              single stratigraphic unit, and will extend 40 km from the granite              
              contact.  Major-,minor-, and trace-element chemistry and 18O will              
              be determined on each sample, along with estimates of P-T paths.               
              Selected samples will be submitted for thermochronometry using                 
              40Ar/39Ar and U-Pb-Th (monazite) techniques, and fluid inclusion               
              compositions and trapping conditions will be evaluated using                   
              microthermometry and laser-ablation ICP-MS.
