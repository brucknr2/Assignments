Abstract    :
              This grant is in the general field of analytical and surface                   
              chemistry and in the subfield of surface chemical studies of                   
              oxidic materials.  Professor J. H. Lunsford will continue his                  
              studies of the transformation of methane to higher hydrocarbons                
              over oxidic catalysts.  A major focus of this work will be on                  
              the role of additives and promoters which affect the kinetics                  
              of methanation.  In particular, magnesium and sodium oxide                     
              catalysts will be studied.  The role of the surface oxide and                  
              peroxide constituents is examined in understanding the rate                    
              limiting step in coupling of methyl radicals.  Professor                       
              Lunsford's previous work was considered ground breaking in the                 
              discovery of this key intermediate in methanation.                             
              Spectroscopic probes (electron spin resonance and x-ray                        
              photoelectron) of the surface oxide structure and composition                  
              will be used.  A new study of complex oxidic structures based                  
              on perovskites and solid solutions of zirconium and calcium                    
              oxides will be initiated.  These studies will help develop                     
              novel catalysts for this important industrial process.
