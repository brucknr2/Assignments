Abstract    :
              The Florida Institute of Technology will connect their campus                  
              network to SURAnet (Southeastern Universities Research                         
              Association network, a regional network which is part of the                   
              NSFNET).  Direct connection to SURAnet will provide researchers                
              with improved access to national networks such as CSNET/Bitnet                 
              and USENET.  Improvement is sought in reliability, speed, turn-                
              around, flexibility, and functions such as file transfer, remote               
              login, and teleconferencing.  The Florida Institute for                        
              Technolgy, through this connection to an external network, will                
              be able to maximize existing local computing resources,                        
              facilitate access to external information and remote computing                 
              resources, and provide a connection for scholarly interaction                  
              with faculty and researchers in diverse geographical locations.
