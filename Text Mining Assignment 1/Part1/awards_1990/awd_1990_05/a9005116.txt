Abstract    :
              Under this Small Grant for Exploratory Research the Principal                  
              Investigator will examine the feasibility of using acousto-optic               
              filter techniques, coupled with selection of times of excellent                
              seeing lasting possibly only fractions of a second, to search for              
              faint companions of brighter stars.  This technique could be very              
              useful in the search for brown dwarf stars and planets around                  
              nearby stars.
