Abstract    :
              The goal of this proposal is to examine the regulation of                      
              replication and gene expression of the tobacco mosaic virus(TMV)               
              as a representative of viruses that express genes through                      
              subgenomic mRNAs. A series of systems has been developed that                  
              provide altered replication and altered gene expression that can               
              be utilized to dissect mechanisms of regulation.  The experimenters            
              will focus on regulation of the 30K and coat protein genes. The                
              regulation of replication will be examined through the use of a two            
              component system. The promoters of the regulated genes will be                 
              dissected. The replication parameters will be determined by using              
              variations of the 2 component system.                                          
                                                                                             
              Understanding the regulation and replication of this model virus               
              will provide useful information relevant to other viruses that use             
              sub genomic RNAs.
