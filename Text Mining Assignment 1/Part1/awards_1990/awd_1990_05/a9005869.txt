Abstract    :
                   The University of North Texas proposes to establish an                    
              Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Materials                  
              Characterization.  The industrial base for this center is primarily            
              within the aerospace, electronics, and petro chemical industries.              
              The Dallas/Ft Worth area is major high technology region in Texas,             
              the third largest and fastest growing in the nation.                           
                   The center proposes to perform fundamental and applied                    
              research to characterize and/or modify the nanostructure of                    
              materials at the atomic level.  The center personnel will                      
              collaborate with aerospace, electronic, energy transportation and              
              metallurgical industries to study the relationship between                     
              nanostructure and mechanical properties such as field strength,                
              deformation kinetics, creep and fatigue.  It will also study                   
              contamination and diffusion at the surfaces of electronic,                     
              metallurgical and polymeric materials to understand adhesion,                  
              corrosion, and electrical properties.
