Abstract    :
                   The Josephine ophiolite is a large, complete ophiolite in                 
              northwestern California, which probably formed by a slow-                      
              spreading mid-ocean ridge.  Previous work has indicated that                   
              magma chambers were episodic resulting in structural extension                 
              and tilting of the entire crustal sequence above an upper mantle               
              detachment.  This continuation will focus on developing criteria               
              for oceanic faults, including serpentinite shear zones above the               
              detachment, and the relationships between magmatism, faulting and              
              hydrothermal metamorphism.  Results are expected to provide                    
              insights into several aspects of slow-spreading mid-ocean ridges               
              and their recognition in ancient examples.
