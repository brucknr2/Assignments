Abstract    :
              With this grant in the Theoretical and Computational Program of                
              the Chemistry Division, Professor Jackson will develop new                     
              methods for investigating the ways in which gas molecules                      
              behave on, and interact with, solid surfaces at finite                         
              temperatures.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              The PI will extend time dependent scattering theory to finite                  
              surface temperatures, thereby allowing for a better connection                 
              to be made between theory and experiment.  The gas molecule and                
              the surface and bulk vibrations are evolved self consistently                  
              and in a fully quantum manner, so that both one-phonon and                     
              multiphonon interactions can be described.  The dependence of                  
              atom- and diatom-metal sticking probabilities on the properties                
              of the gas particle, the solid, and the gas-surface interaction                
              will be studied.
