Abstract    :
              This research concerns a fundamental study of the effect of low                
              levels of copolymers on the properties of aqueous colloidal                    
              suspensions.  Systematically designed, novel, block and graft                  
              copolymers with narrow molecular-weight distributions of each                  
              block will be synthesized and mixed with selected colloidal                    
              particles having narrow-size distributions.  The effect of the                 
              adsorbed copolymers on the stability and properties of the                     
              suspensions will be measured by techniques including rheology and              
              light scattering.  The particle concentrations will range from                 
              dilute to highly concentrated in order to study the critical                   
              effect of particle concentration on suspension microstructure.                 
              Steric stability is provided by a water-soluble tail segment on                
              the copolymer that is anchored to the particle by an adsorbed                  
              hydrophobic head block.  The effectiveness of the water-insoluble              
              block as an anchor will be studied as a function of chemical                   
              structure.  It is anticipated that specific interactions between               
              the particle surface and the adsorbed copolymer will be of                     
              particular importance in aqueous, hydrogen-bonding media.  In                  
              addition to the steric stabilization mechanism, electrostatic                  
              stabilization is also important for the case of charged tail                   
              segments.  The particles to be studied will be well-characterized              
              inorganic materials, primarily SiO2, Al2O3, SiC, and Si3N4.
