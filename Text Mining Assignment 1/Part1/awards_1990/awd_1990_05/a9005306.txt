Abstract    :
              We propose to investigate the formation of discordant dunite in                
              the Trinity and Josephine peridotites, in northern California                  
              and southern Oregon.  Quantification of the degree and nature of               
              wall rock reaction in natural examples is crucial.  If wall rock               
              reaction commonly has a significant effect, then this process may              
              be as important as melting and crystal fractionation in the                    
              production of magmas in the mantle.  We propose to test our                    
              hypothesis by measuring major and trace element compositions of                
              pyroxene, olivine and spinel in carefully selected samples of                  
              dunite and host peridotite.  We will analyze individual crystals               
              in thin section using the election and ion microprobes at MIT and              
              Woods Hole.  Use of major and trace element data on cores of                   
              individual mineral grains to estimate parental liquid                          
              compositions, and solution of a series of mass balance equations               
              for these elements, should provide a quantitative estimate of the              
              relative importance of crystal fractionation and wall rock                     
              reaction in the genesis of discordant dunite.
