Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Thermal fluctuations create regional disorder within protein                   
              structures.  It is increasingly apparent that this dynamical                   
              disorder is both intrinsic to proteins and inherently important                
              for their functioning.  Dr. Friedman proposes to study this                    
              relationship between dynamical disorder and functionality.  He                 
              will use heme proteins as a model system, studying the                         
              rebinding of ligands after photodissication.  The focus will                   
              be upon characterization of parameters of the disordered states                
              and establishing their relationship to the quantum yield of                    
              photolysis, the rebinding rates and the entry into and escape                  
              from the heme pocket by the ligand.
