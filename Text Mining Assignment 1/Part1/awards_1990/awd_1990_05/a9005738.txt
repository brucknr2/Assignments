Abstract    :
                   This proposal is a central element of the Tracer Release                  
              Experiment (TRE), a process study of the World Ocean Circulation               
              Experiment (WOCE).  The PI will release and track a suite of mid-              
              depth floats.  These will be released in conjunction with the                  
              release of measured amounts of a stable chemical species.  At                  
              selected intervals, the distributions of the chemical will be                  
              measured.  Over the duration of the experiment, the floats will                
              be tracked to provide a continuous record of the tracer history.
