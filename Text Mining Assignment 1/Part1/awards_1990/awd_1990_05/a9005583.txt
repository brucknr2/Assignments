Abstract    :
                   Recent work has indicated that the role of fluids in rock                 
              deformation is greater than previously recognized, however the                 
              extent of the influence of fluids is not well constrained.  This               
              project will use oxygen isotopic techniques to document the                    
              spatial and temporal distribution of fluids in a well                          
              constrained structural sections by using oxygen isotopes as                    
              tracers.  The work will focus on several thrust sheets of                      
              different compositions in the Ruby Gap duplex of Australia, which              
              has recently been extensively studied structurally.  Results are               
              expected to provide an estimate of the influence of fluids and                 
              deformation mechanisms and the rock volume affected by isotopic                
              exchange.
