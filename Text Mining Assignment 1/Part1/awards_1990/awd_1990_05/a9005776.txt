Abstract    :
                   Sediments from oceans and continents constitute a valuable                
              recorder for fluctuations of geomagnetic field direction and                   
              intensity.  Paleodirectional studies from such sediments have                  
              made important contributions to magnetostratigraphy, continental               
              margin accretionary tectonics, and to core processes which lead                
              to reversals and secular variation of the geomagnetic field.                   
              Reliable paleointensity data can provide a new higher resolution               
              tool for magnetostratigraphy and constraints for unique                        
              descriptions of geomagnetic field models to explain reversals and              
              secular variation.  This study will elucidate important effects                
              of clay and silica content on the recorded paleodirection and                  
              intensity of natural remanent magnetization (NRM) and carry out a              
              combined laboratory and field study to develop a better                        
              acquisition model for ocean sediment magnetization and design                  
              more reliable techniques for extracting geomagnetic                            
              paleointensity from sediments.
