Abstract    :
              This investigation is based on the principal investigator's previous           
              work on the analysis of the structure of formulas in negation normal           
              form.  A result of this work was the formulation of the path                   
              dissolution method.  This project will continue exploration of this            
              method and related inference mechanisms.  The implementation of this           
              method will be developed further to investigate the following                  
              techniques in particular: link selection; pure rule deletion;                  
              backtracking; theory links and dissolution; and star chains.  Also,            
              proof-theoretic questions will be studied, in particular, related to           
              the following: dissolution, analytic tableaux, and the distributive            
              law; dissolution vs.  resolution; induction and quality.
