Abstract    :
                   The Araceae are a diverse and highly variable family of                   
              tropical plants, and the evolutionary relationships among its                  
              genera (approximately 110) and species (2,300) are poorly                      
              understood.  Dr. Michael Grayum has completed a monograph                      
              entitled "External Pollen Ultrastructure of the Araceae and                    
              Putatively Related Taxa", in which he presents a survey of pollen              
              morphology in almost 400 species representing nearly all genera                
              in the family.  The survey uses light and scanning electron                    
              micrographs to reveal the fine structure of pollen grains that                 
              characterize each species.  Dr. Grayum's monograph will be                     
              published, with NSF support, in the Annals of the Missouri                     
              Botanical Garden.                                                              
                   The proposed monograph will be an important reference volume              
              for the identification of aroid species using pollen.  The                     
              morphological data presented in the monograph will open new                    
              research avenues for establishing the evolutionary relationships               
              within the family.
