Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Insect growth and metamorphosis is controlled primarily by the molting         
              hormone, 20-hydroxyecdysone (20HE), and juvenile hormone (JH) which,           
              when present, prevents metamorphosis.  A neuropeptide, eclosion hormone,       
              then triggers ecdysis at the end of each molt.  During the next 5 years,       
              this project will focus on the action of these hormones in the context         
              of identified genes in the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta, and the            
              fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster.  The particular projects include: 1)        
              The spatial and temporal patterning of ecdysteroid receptors in the            
              epidermis during a larval molt and the larval-pupal transformation and         
              their relationship to the competence of the cells to respond to the            
              hormone.  2) Structural analysis of the gene for insecticyanin, the            
              pigment necessary for adaptive coloration, hormonal regulation of its          
              expression, and factors involved in the bidirectional secretion of this        
              protein.  3) The dual role (induction and repression) of 20HE in               
              determining the timing of expression of gene for dopa decarboxylase, the       
              enzyme necessary for cuticular melanization and hardening after ecdysis.       
              4) The role of ecdysteroid in the regulation of eclosion hormone gene          
              expression and of these two hormones in the onset of alcohol                   
              dehydrogenase gene expression at adult eclosion in Drosophila.                 
              These studies will clarify our understanding about how 20HE and JH act         
              together to regulate specific genes during a larval molt and at                
              metamorphosis and how the changing ecdysteroid titer may coordinate the        
              onset of gene expression during a molt.  Furthermore, they will define         
              for the first time in a complex system how a neuropeptide and a steroid        
              hormone interact to control specific gene expression.  This in-depth           
              knowledge about the mode of action of these critical developmental             
              hormones should also serve as a basis for new approaches to insect             
              control.
