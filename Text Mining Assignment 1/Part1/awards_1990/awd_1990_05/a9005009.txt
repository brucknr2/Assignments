Abstract    :
                   This award provides funds for 67% of the costs of acquiring               
              a microscope system with a heating/cooling stage for the study of              
              microscopic fluid inclusions in geological samples. The fluid                  
              inclusion system will be used by researchers in the Department of              
              Geological Sciences at Case Western Reserve University. The                    
              University is to provide the remaining 33% of the costs.                       
                   The Case Western Reserve University Department of Geological              
              Sciences has a research program in sandstone diagenesis aimed at               
              determining quantitatively the conditions and timing of the                    
              different stages of sandstone formation. The study of fluid                    
              inclusions in sandstone provides an independent and direct way to              
              determine the temperature and salinity of the waters trapped                   
              during formation.
