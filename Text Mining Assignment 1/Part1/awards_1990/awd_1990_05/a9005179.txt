Abstract    :
              The demonstration of a major advance from a Labradorean dispersal              
              center flowing essentially at right angles to regional topographic             
              features, and that overtopped Loks Land despite an unconstrained               
              margin facing the open ocean to the SE, provides strong evidence               
              that the flux of ice during this advance must have been great.  The            
              cross-sectional area for that portion of the ice facing the                    
              Labrador Sea is ca. 300 km2.  Assuming a velocity between that of              
              Jacobshavn Glacier, an outlet glacier draining the Greenland Ice               
              Sheet (8 km a-1), and the Ross Ice Shelf, Antarctica (1 km a-1)                
              yields an annual flux of 300 to 2400 km3 a-1.  This is about the same          
              fresh-water flux entering the North Atlantic when the St Lawrence              
              outlet was opened by the retreating Laurentide Ice Sheet 11,000                
              years ago (30,000 m3 sec-1 or 1000 km3 a-1; Teller, 1988).                     
              Recognizing the importance of ice-sheet/ocean interactions in the              
              global climate system, we are proposing a research campaign to                 
              include a new field effort to define more precisely the spatial                
              limits of this newly recognized advance, and the timing of its                 
              onset and retreat, and to model the ice dynamics based on the field            
              evidence.  Specifically, we intend to address five objectives:  1)             
              Defining the maximum limits of the Labradorean advance; 2)                     
              Deciphering the interaction between the Foxe outlet glacier the                
              flowed out Frobisher Bay and the Labradorean ice sheet backfilling             
              the bay; 3) Determining whether all of Meta Incognita Peninsula was            
              over-ridden by Labradorean ice; 4) Defining the temporal limits of             
              these advances; and using the field evidence on the limits and                 
              timing of ice sheet advance and retreat as input to glaciological              
              models to provide realistic ice limits, and ice velocities.                    
              Accurate reconstructions of the overall configuration of the                   
              Laurentide Ice Sheet and the pattern of its flow are necessary to              
              understand the climate and general circulation during a glaciation,            
              the response of the earth's crust to loading, and contribute to our            
              understanding of ice dynamics.
