Abstract    :
                   This award provides funds for the acquisition of a gas                    
              chromatograph and combustion line to be interfaced with a stable               
              isotope ratio mass spectrometer in the Department of                           
              Environmental Sciences at the University of Virginia.                          
                   The new instrumental system will enable the determination of              
              nitrogen and carbon isotopic compositions of the individual                    
              molecular components of mixtures of complex organic compounds.                 
              Such analytical capabilities offers enhanced interpretation of                 
              the source and history of organic material preserved in the                    
              natural fossil record and will be used in geological, biological,              
              and anthropological research.
