Abstract    :
                   This award provides computational equipment for the study of              
              stochastic approximations in statistics. The three areas of                    
              emphasis include the study of modifications of stochastic                      
              approximation methods to insure that a point of global rather                  
              than local minimum is approached, the study of stochastic                      
              approximations in the case of dependent errors (that is, errors                
              that do not form something close to a martingale), and the study               
              of finite sample behavior of stochastic approximation methods.
