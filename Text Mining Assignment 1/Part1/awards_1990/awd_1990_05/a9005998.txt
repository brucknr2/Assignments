Abstract    :
              A combined experimental and numerical study will be carried                    
              out to explore the interaction of dispersed solid particles                    
              with gas-phase turbulence in fully developed channel flow.                     
              Particles will be dispersed uniformly at an upstream location,                 
              and quantitative measurements will be with a single component                  
              LDA system.  These will be complemented by sheet-illuminated                   
              flow visualization.  The computation will be by direct                         
              numerical simulation (DNS).                                                    
                                                                                             
              Following an earlier investigation of mixing layers, a                         
              particular focus will be on the elucidation of preferred                       
              organized structures both in the fluid phase and the                           
              particulate phase, and the relation between these structures.                  
              Such information is essential for the ultimate construction of                 
              models to predict reliably the characteristics of two-phase                    
              flows.
