Abstract    :
                   Relatively little is known about how disturbance regimes                  
              vary along major environmental gradients and how that variation                
              contributes to coarse-scale vegetation patterns.  The proposed                 
              research will focus on variation i disturbance regimes along a                 
              west-to-east trans-Andean transect from Andean montane                         
              rainforests to the ecotone with the Patagonian steppe at c. 40 S               
              latitude.  The major disturbance are fie windthrow mass                        
              movements, logging, and the effects of introduced browsing                     
              animals.  The research is multi-scale in approach and includes                 
              the qualification of vegetation and disturbance patterns at a                  
              landscape scale as well as the analysis of mechanisms responsible              
              for those patterns at stand scales.  The will map vegetation and               
              disturbances from a series of aerial photographs of different                  
              ages, date disturbance events with tree-ring techniques, and                   
              quantitatively analyze tree population structure to examine                    
              responses to disturbances.  The expected results will be                       
              significant contributions to both the theory of landscape ecology              
              and to the methodology for quantification of the spatial and                   
              temporal characteristics of disturbances along an extensive                    
              environmental gradient.  It will also provide an understanding                 
              of how spatial heterogeneity in the vegetation results from both               
              the variation in the physical environment and variation in                     
              disturbance regimes as modified by human activities.   //
