Abstract    :
                   This award is for paleomagnetic studies aimed at determining              
              the timing and rate of the motion of the Hawaiian and other                    
              hotspots relative to the paleomagnetic axis, and the implications              
              of such motion for true polar wander, using methods recently                   
              developed to determine accurate paleomagnetic poles with                       
              exceptionally narrow age resolution (e.e.+1 m.y.).  The approach,              
              based on the analysis of the shapes of marine magnetic anomalies               
              recording ancient seafloor spreading, allows one to overcome the               
              difficulties of determining paleomagnetic poles in the presence                
              of systematic errors like those that plagued pioneering studies                
              of magnetic anomaly data.
