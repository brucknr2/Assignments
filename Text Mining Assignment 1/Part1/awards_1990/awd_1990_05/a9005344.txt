Abstract    :
              The sedimentary and volcaniclastic rocks of the Oligocene Creede               
              Formation will be investigated in order to assess the range and                
              evolution of intracaldera sedimentary environments, and the                    
              controls on diagenesis and alteration in an intracaldera setting.              
              The Creede Formation was chosen for this study because of the                  
              extensive exposures of relatively underformed intracaldera                     
              sedimentary rocks associated with a large resurgent caldera, the               
              well known volcanic stratigraphy and chronology of the Creede area,            
              and the opportunity to test and contribute to the well-studied                 
              Creede hydrothermal model.  In contrast to previous studies of                 
              intracaldera sedimentary rocks, this study will focus on evaluating            
              the basin-wide field relationships among sedimentary, primary                  
              pyroclastic, and hydrothermal rocks, as well as authigenic mineral             
              chemistry and distribution.  These data will be used to:  1)                   
              develop an understanding of depositional processes and sediment                
              distribution patterns occurring in an intracaldera basin; and 2)               
              assess the relative controls of the depositional environment,                  
              hydrothermal activity, organic carbon distribution, and basin                  
              hydrology on the diagenesis of the volcaniclastic rocks.  The                  
              results of this project will provide a working model for                       
              sedimentary deposition and diagenesis in an intracaldera setting,              
              as well as allow an assessment of the role the Creede Formation                
              sediments may have played in the evolution of the Creed                        
              hydrothermal system.  In general, the results will contribute to               
              our understanding of caldera evolution and hydrothermal systems                
              associated with calderas, and provide valuable baseline data for               
              evaluation of other intracaldera sedimentary sequences.
