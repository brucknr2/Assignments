Abstract    :
              The aim of this project is to initiate a river sampling program in             
              the USSR, specifically on the rivers draining into the Black Sea.              
              This initiative has been made possible by recent events in both the            
              US and the USSR and will involve close collaboration with                      
              scientists at the Institute of Biology of the South Seas in                    
              Sevastopol with exchanges of samples, data and personnel.  The aim             
              is to expand the data base for studies of the global geochemical               
              cycle and, in particular, to investigate the influence of the                  
              Soviet rivers on the chemistry of the Black Sea.
