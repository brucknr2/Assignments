Abstract    :
              The purpose of this research is to develop several applications                
              of the Likelihood Principle  for investigating macroeconometric                
              problems that have been difficult to address using classical                   
              methods.  Further, methods will be devised for evaluating the                  
              performance of these procedures in repeated samples, and for                   
              illustrating the impact of a broad range of different assumptions              
              on the results.  The first consideration is whether macroeconomic              
              time-series-data are best described as integrated or trend-                    
              stationary.  The performance of Classical integration and co-                  
              integration tests will be compared against trend-stationary                    
              alternatives.  In addition, a method will be devised for                       
              examining the performance of macroeconomic models from a Bayesian              
              perspective, and to seek the appropriate interpretation of                     
              classically obtained results.  Finally, the theory of dynamic                  
              games will be extended to models in which the structure of the                 
              relevant model is not known with certainty.  This research is                  
              important because it will provide better methods for analyzing                 
              time-series-data, which is the type of data used in much of the                
              empirical research in economics and the other social sciences.
