Abstract    :
                   Professor Geoghegan will investigate two kinds of problems                
              on the borderline between topology and algebra.  The first set of              
              problems concerns developments of his recent work with A. Nicas                
              on one-parameter fixed point theory.  They recently found a                    
              "higher trace" in Hochschild homology which faithfully detects                 
              the primary obstruction to removing circles of fixed points from               
              a homotopy.  They will now investigate the algebra surrounding                 
              the remaining geometric obstructions, as well as related matters.              
              The second set of problems concerns higher order end theory of                 
              groups.  He will investigate various topological end invariants                
              of a group which should detect interesting properties of the                   
              group itself.
