Abstract    :
                   This award provides partial funding for the acquisition of a              
              multi-anvil, high-pressure-temperature system to be installed and              
              operated at the Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory of Columbia              
              University. The acquisition and assembly of the high-pressure                  
              system is being jointly supported by NSF (37%), DOE (37%) and                  
              Columbia University (26%).                                                     
                   The high-pressure apparatus is one of original design by the              
              PI on this award, and it will be capable of routine operation up               
              to 250 kilobar and 2000C on several cubic millimeters of sample.               
              The equipment will be used primarily in investigations on the                  
              properties and behavior of planetary interior materials at high-               
              pressure and temperature.
