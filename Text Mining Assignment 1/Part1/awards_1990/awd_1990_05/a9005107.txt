Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Given its earthquake history, Charleston, South Carolina had                   
              undergone an earthquake education program prior to Hurricane                   
              Hugo striking on September 21, 1989.  This study seeks to                      
              examine how effectively earthquake education in the                            
              Charleston, South Carolina area transferred to appropriate                     
              preparedness and response activities for Hurricane Hugo.  The                  
              primary data collection methodology will consist of telephone                  
              interviews with a sample of participants in the earthquake                     
              education program and a control sample of residents in the                     
              greater Charleston area who did not participate in the                         
              program.  Supplemented data will be obtained through more                      
              extensive personal interviews with a smaller subsample of                      
              persons who participated in the phone survey.
