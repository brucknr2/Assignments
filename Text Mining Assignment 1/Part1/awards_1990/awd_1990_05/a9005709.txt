Abstract    :
                   This award provides support for the operation of the ion                  
              microprobe regional facility in the Department of Geology and                  
              Geophysics at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI).                 
              The facility provides analytical support for a large number of                 
              projects in the geosciences that require microanalysis of trace                
              element and isotope abundances with excellent spatial resolution               
              down to 10 microns. The facility is accessible to the national                 
              community of geoscientists outside WHOI for a minimum of 50% of                
              its operating time.
