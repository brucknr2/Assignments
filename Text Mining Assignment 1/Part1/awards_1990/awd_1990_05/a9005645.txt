Abstract    :
                   The overall goal of this research project is to clarify our               
              understanding of how cyclones (storms) and related atmospheric                 
              weather systems form and intensify.  The results are likely to                 
              contribute to improved skill in weather prediction.                            
                   Three phenomena will be investigated.  The first are                      
              extratropical cyclones, particularly cases where there is rapid                
              intensification.  The PI hopes to identify the factors which                   
              cause cyclogenesis to be explosive.  A second area of study is                 
              directed at mesoscale solitary gravity waves.  These waves                     
              represent disturbances with the cyclone that typically are 100                 
              kilometers wide and one hour in duration and cause very rapid                  
              pressure falls and sometimes dangerous winds.  The third area                  
              involves the study of polar lows which are small intense cyclones              
              that develop primarily over the ocean in polar regions.  For all               
              three topics, the PI will employ both observational and model-                 
              generated data sets.  The latter will be taken from simulations                
              done with mesoscale model at the National Center for Atmospheric               
              Research.
