Abstract    :
                   A central concept in evolution is the escalation of biotic                
              interaction over geologic time.  Among the most testable of                    
              escalation hypotheses is the "bulldozing hypothesis:"                          
              accelerating bioturbation caused a commensurate decline of non-                
              locomotive taxa living on unconsolidated substrata.  The changing              
              intensity of bioturbation can change the rock record, altering                 
              taphonomy, sedimentology and stratigraphic resolution.                         
                   PI will test the bulldozing hypothesis for a critical                     
              interval of geologic time.  Data covers 7 time intervals                       
              (formations) and 3 shelf environments.  PI will gather                         
              quantitative data on lighology, ichnology and body fossils from                
              >1200 samples via bed by bed logging of 400-500 m of Silurian and              
              Devonian carbonates and siliciclastics in New York and                         
              Pennsylvania during 6 person-months of field work.  The interval               
              (Wenlockian-Eifelian) spans some 40 million years, during which                
              preliminary work indicates that ecologically significant                       
              bioturbation first affected the Appalachian Basin.  This is the                
              first study to test the association between bioturbation and                   
              vulnerable body fossils.  These data will also document cross-                 
              shelf environmental trends of bioturbation during the study                    
              interval.
