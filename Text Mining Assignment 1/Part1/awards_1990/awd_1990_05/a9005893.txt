Abstract    :
              The PI's propose to continue the development of scanning x-ray                 
              microscopy and Gabor holography using undulator radiation at the               
              National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS).                                      
                                                                                             
              During the past three years, in collaboration with colleagues                  
              from the NSLS, Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, and IBM, the                      
              researchers have developed, instrumented and commissioned the                  
              soft x-ray undulator beamline X-1A, along with the apparatus for               
              scanning transmission microscope (STXM) and Gabor holography.                  
              The experimental program using these instruments has started.                  
              The initial operating experience points up several areas where                 
              further development will have a profound effect on the                         
              performance and usefulness of the facilities.  Some of these                   
              relate to improved resolution and increased capabilities of the                
              instruments, while others involve auxiliary studies to elucidate               
              the range of applications for biological research.  In addition,               
              the PIs plan to participate in the user program, and more of                   
              their effort will be devoted to helping users during their early               
              experiments.
