Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Sodium transport across the cell membrane is a basic function that             
              plays an important role in several physiological functions such as             
              fertilization, regulation of pH, volume regulation and                         
              transmembrane signalling.  Dr. Dixon plans to use mature red blood             
              cell from the dog which serve as an excellent model to study both              
              sodium ion transport and sodium ion exchange.  The results of the              
              data collected here may provide information concerning the                     
              mechanisms of several physiological processes related to transport             
              pathways.//
