Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award is for a pilot project involving two anthropology                   
              professors and one graduate student in Botswana.  The project                  
              will study the economic and reproductive strategies of men in a                
              pastoral society; interview mothers about their perceptions of                 
              sex differences in infants to try to explain a dramatic sex bias               
              in mortality against male infants; and develop a methodology for               
              analyzing the differences in work effort of men and women, adults              
              and children.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              This pilot research is important to help the investigators                     
              develop their procedures for a large scale study of the conflict               
              between biological goals, such as reproductive success, and                    
              culturally defined goals such as maintenance of the patrilineage.              
              Understanding of how cultural transmission transforms biological               
              motives is important in understanding how to maintain biological               
              well-being.
