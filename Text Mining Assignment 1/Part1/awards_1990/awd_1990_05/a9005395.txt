Abstract    :
                   The mid-Cretaceous paleogeography and tectonic setting of                 
              southwestern British Columbia is part of a larger problem along                
              the Pacific Northwest continental margin.  This project continues              
              study of the Tyaughton-Methow basin that records the mid-                      
              Cretaceous history of this area.  Prior results have clarified                 
              the relative contribution of convergent vs strike-slip tectonics               
              and this work will address facies models, paleocurrent data,                   
              petrologic data and geochemistry of the arc volcanics and                      
              volcanic sediments to determine back-arc/forearc positions,                    
              subduction zone polarity and the spatial configuration of                      
              volcanic arcs in relation to the ancient margin.  Results will                 
              add to the regional picture of terrain amalgamation, accretion                 
              and dispersal along the Pacific Northwest.
