Abstract    :
              This project is concerned with the design of algorithms and                    
              programming environments for parallel computer systems containing              
              large numbers of interconnected processors.  The goals are to develop          
              some of the generic algorithmic techniques that users of such systems          
              will require, to determine what primitive operations should be                 
              included in a high-level parallel programming language, and to solve           
              some of the algorithmic problems that will arise in the implementation         
              of such primitive operations.  The operations of particular interest           
              relate to set-oriented data structures and combinatorial search.  The          
              approach to the efficient implementation of these operations uses              
              ideas from randomized load balancing, parallel tree search and dynamic         
              tree embedding.  In order to support high-level parallel programming,          
              efficient algorithms for sorting in the presence of faulty processors,         
              message routing and synchronization control are also investigated.
