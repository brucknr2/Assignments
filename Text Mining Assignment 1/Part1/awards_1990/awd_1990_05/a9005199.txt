Abstract    :
              This project is to investigate the accretion of the Earth and the              
              separation of the Earth's core and crust from the Earth's mantle,              
              by analyzing well characterized samples from different                         
              geochemical reservoirs with neutron activation analysis for the                
              moderately siderophile and chalcophile trace elements Mo, W, As,               
              and Sb, and by determination of metal/silicate partition                       
              coefficients for As and Sb.  The varying depletion relative to                 
              elements with different affinities for Fe-metal or sulfide                     
              provide clues to the events involving accretion and metal                      
              segregation in the mantle, including the possibility of late                   
              veneers that accreted on the Earth after core formation, or the                
              possibility of metal retention in the mantle during core                       
              formation.  Determining the abundances and depletion of these                  
              elements un samples from terrains of different geological ages                 
              will also address the timing of core formation in the Earth,                   
              because the possibility of continued core formation through a                  
              substantial portion of geologic time has been invoked to explain               
              some of the recent lead isotope results for samples from the                   
              mantle.
