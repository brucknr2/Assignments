Abstract    :
                This research is to advance the knowledge of three dimensional               
              structure of the Earth's mantle.  The improvement of P- and S-                 
              wave velocity models will be accomplished through expansion of                 
              the following observations:  augmentation of the waveform data                 
              bases using data from many new broad-band digital stations                     
              deployed after 1984, expansion of absolute and differential                    
              travel-time data sets measured from digital seismograms, and                   
              development of a new "summary travel time" data base from ISC                  
              Bulletins containing seismic station-source region anomalies.                  
              Acquisition of this data base will be followed by a joint                      
              inversion of waveforms and traveltimes; in the past these data                 
              were treated separately.  In addition to this primary objective,               
              the acquired data will allow the examination for large scale                   
              anisotropy and lateral variations in Q.
