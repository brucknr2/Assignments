Abstract    :
              Rhythmic biological phenomena which occur at approximately 24 h                
              intervals in the absence of environmental time cues are termed                 
              circadian rhythms. Two basic questions about circadian rhythms                 
              concern the mechanisms by which: 1) time information is used to                
              regulate biological phenomena observed to be rhythmic, and 2) time             
              is measured. To address the former, genes have been identified                 
              whose expression is regulated in a circadian fashion in Arabidopsis            
              thaliana. Elements will be characterized that are required, in cis             
              or in trans, for this circadian regulation using gene fusion, gel              
              retardation and DNA protection strategies. The mechanism of time               
              measurement will be addressed through the identification and                   
              characterization of mutations which disrupt biological timekeeping.            
              The circadian rhythm in nitrate reductase will be explored to see              
              if the protein expression and mRNA levels correspond. If they do               
              correspond, nitrate reductase levels will be measured in an attempt            
              to screen for circadian regulation mutations. Fusion genes, in                 
              which clock control is conferred on a reporter gene will be used               
              as molecular tags on the biological clock in screens designed to               
              identify mutations  which affect clock function. The circadian                 
              rhythm in stomatal apertures will be used to select  mutants in                
              which circadian regulation is altered. Characterization of these               
              mutations will identify elements either of the clock itself or of              
              the regulatory system by which time control is exerted. *** //
