Abstract    :
                   This project seeks to blend mathematical research on the                  
              harmonic analysis of eigenfunctions of a Sturm-Liouville                       
              differential equation with the algebraic construct of a                        
              hypergroup.  The hypergroup consists of an algebra of measures                 
              supported on the interval on which the equation is defined.                    
              There is a converse direction as well: a one-dimensional                       
              hypergroup defines a Sturm-Liouville problem and the characters                
              in the measure algebra are normalized eigenfunctions of the                    
              problem.                                                                       
                   The work to be carried out falls into four areas: first, to               
              continue exploiting the relationship between hypergroup measure                
              algebras and the measure algebras that have Sturm-Liouville                    
              eigenfunctions as their characters.  Second, investigate                       
              structural questions about hypergroups themselves.  Third, the                 
              harmonic analysis of eigenfunction expansions will carried out                 
              and fourth, a student research project to develop the                          
              computational and graphic software in support of the first three               
              areas is planned.  Results of this work are expected to have                   
              applications to probability theory, orthogonal polynomials and                 
              the theory of special functions.
