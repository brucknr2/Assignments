Abstract    :
                   Molecular methods of DNA analysis will be employed to                     
              examine the genetic relatedness among populations of several                   
              marine species that have global distributions.  Special attention              
              will be devoted to marine turtles, where longstanding questions                
              exist concerning the historical times of rookery colonization,                 
              whether females return to their natal sites to nest, and the                   
              degree of genetic contact among rookeries involving both males                 
              and females.  This molecular  appraisal of the life history of                 
              marine turtles will offer evidence on the degree of demographic                
              independence among turtle colonies that should be critical in the              
              development of populaton management strategies for these                       
              endangered species.  Similar molecular genetic assays will also                
              be conducted on globally-distributed oceanic birds, which may                  
              prove to exhibit life history and migrational patterns somewhat                
              analogous to those of the marine turtles.  Assays of DNA from                  
              both the nuclear and mitochondrial genes in these and other                    
              marine species will provide knowledge of migratory patterns in                 
              organisms that are difficult to observe directly.  The data will               
              also contribute to development of a history in which the degree                
              of concordance among the genealogies of independent genes is                   
              proposed as an indicator of the historical magnitudes of                       
              population separations.
