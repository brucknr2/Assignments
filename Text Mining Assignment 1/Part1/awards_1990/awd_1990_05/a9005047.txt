Abstract    :
              We are examining the telomere region of the fruitfly, Drosophila               
              melanogaster, as a model for metazoan telomeres.  We have shown                
              that in Drosophila, in contrast to yeast, a chromosome from which              
              the terminus has been deleted can be transmitted for many                      
              generations.  Our structural analysis of the subterminal portion               
              of the telomere region has revealed a complex interspersion of                 
              different repetitive sequences.  Preliminary results suggest an                
              unexpectedly high frequency of terminal and subterminal length                 
              variations.  In addition, we have documented a case in which the               
              expression of a gene was repressed when it was transposed to a                 
              subterminal site.                                                              
                                                                                             
              The termini of eukaryotic chromosomes, called telomeres, are                   
              specialized structures thought to be required for chromosome                   
              stability.  It has recently been shown that a characteristic                   
              terminal sequence motif is conserved among unicellular eukaryotes,             
              vertebrates and higher plants.  In many eukaryotes the telomere                
              region also encompasses more complex repetitive sequences that are             
              shared among all or a subset or the chromosome tips.  Telomeres                
              have been studied most extensively in single-celled eukaryotes and             
              there is little known about the overall sequence organization,                 
              functions, or dynamics of the telomere region of multicellular                 
              eukaryotes.***
