Abstract    :
              This project aims: 1) to determine the sequence signals                        
              requiredfor accurate processing of E. coli ribosomal RNA; 2) to                
              purify the enzymes and factors required for the maturation of the              
              5' and3' termini of 16S rRNA; and 3) to assess the nature of the               
              real substrate for maturation (and help analyze the relation of                
              protein synthesis and maturation).  The work will be based on                  
              previous studies which have analyzed the pathways of 16S and                   
              23SrRNA formation; have provided good assays for  maturation; and              
              have started to determine some of the sequence requirements for                
              maturation by studying the extent of processing in constructs                  
              lacking particular spacer sequences.
