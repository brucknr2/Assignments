Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The proposed research will integrate biophysical, biochemical,                 
              cellular, physiological and genetic studies on plasmodesmata (pd)              
              to establish an appropriate framework that will then allow an                  
              investigation of the cellular processes by which the plant                     
              regulates its cell-to-cell communication system.  Biophysical                  
              studies will be performed on a simple cellular system in order to              
              determine the unitary pd conductance.  Such measurements are                   
              essential for a further sub-structural analysis of the pd, as                  
              well as to provide a rigorous foundation for detailed studies on               
              the cellular controls that orchestrate cell-to-cell size                       
              exclusion limits.  Physiological studies on the role of pd in                  
              solute fluxes will also be performed.  Since pd are likely to be               
              an important determinant of organ development, an experimental                 
              system will be established that will permit identification of                  
              the processes that control secondary pd formation.  In this                    
              ongoing collaboration (between Beachy and Dr. William Lucas of                 
              the University of California, Davis), it has been established                  
              that transgenic tobacco plants in which the 30 kDa movement                    
              protein (MP) of TMV is expressed have pd whose size exclusion                  
              limits are up-regulated to sizes in excess of 9.4 kDa.  The mode               
              by which the 30 kDa TMV-MP effects this change will be further                 
              explored.  It is hypothesized that this protein interacts                      
              directly with the plasmodesma.  Based on this concept,                         
              biochemical isolation and purification of pd proteins are                      
              proposed.   A genetic system in Arabidopsis will be developed to               
              permit the identification and isolation of genes involved in                   
              virus movement and pd function.                                                
                                                                                             
              Plasmodesmata are microscopic channels between individual plant                
              cells.  Intercellular communication by passage of molecules                    
              through these channels is critical for the normal development and              
              physiological function of the entire plant.  In certain plant                  
              viral infections, the virus gains access to the cell interior at               
              a localized site and passes from cell to cell through the                      
              plasmodesmata throughout the plant.  Passage of the virus                      
              through plasmodesmata is facilitated by a virally encoded                      
              protein which effectively enlarges the plasmodesmatal channel.                 
              This research will take advantage of the viral protein to                      
              identify and study the components of the plant plasmodesmata.                  
              Knowledge of the components of plasmodesmata will facilitate                   
              further studies of the formation of plasmodesmata and the                      
              mechanisms by which molecular traffic through the plasmodesmata                
              is regulated.  The results of this research will be important                  
              contributions to basic knowledge of cell to cell communication in              
              plants.
