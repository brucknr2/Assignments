Abstract    :
              Mammalian cytochrome c oxidase (COX) consists of 13 subunits:                  
              three encoded in mitochondrial DNA and 10 in nuclear DNA.  Long-               
              term goals are to understand the regulation of this critically                 
              important enzyme complex through analysis of the genetic regulatory            
              sequences controlling expression of COX nuclear genes.  Short term             
              goals include defining the cis-regulatory sequence elements (cis-              
              elements) in the promoters of two COX genes:  human COX5B (for a               
              ubiquitous subunit VB), and bovine COX8H (for subunit VIII-heart).             
              They will:  (1) identify by DNA sequencing those cis-elements in               
              the promoter of the COX5B gene known to be important for                       
              transcriptional control of other genes; (2) identify unique cis-               
              elements important for transcriptional control of respiratory genes            
              by functional analysis of the COX5B promoter through a) analysis               
              of DNAseI hypersensitive sites, b) gene fusion experiments, and C)             
              transient expression studies; (3) clone and sequence the promoter              
              of the bovine COX8H gene to identify unique cis-elements important             
              for tissue-specific expression.  These studies on the cis-                     
              regulatory sequence elements controlling expression of nuclear                 
              genes for this unique enzyme complex will contribute to our                    
              understanding of the genetic regulatory signals involved in                    
              mitochondrial biogenesis and in tissue=specific expression of this             
              important enzyme complex.*** //
