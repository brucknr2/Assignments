Abstract    :
              Chemists carrying out frontier research are relying more and                   
              more on computers that are capable of handling sophisticated                   
              simulations, data analysis and graphics software.  The need to                 
              accomodate multiple users on the single laboratory computer and                
              multiple users on a single chemistry department facility can be                
              met by a single solution:  individual work stations for the                    
              majority of user needs and, for the remainder, ready access to                 
              other types of work stations and, ultimately, to a mini                        
              supercomputer.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              This award from the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program                   
              will help the Department of Chemistry at the North Dakota State                
              University to acquire, maintain and operate a graphics computer                
              system.  The areas of chemical research that will be enhanced                  
              by the acquisition include:                                                    
                                                                                             
              1.  Theoretical and experimental studies of Lewis acid chelated                
                  intermediates.                                                             
                                                                                             
              2.  Intramolecular hydrogen bonding, energetics and dynamics of                
                  main group organometallic reactions.                                       
                                                                                             
              3.  Total synthesis of natural products.
