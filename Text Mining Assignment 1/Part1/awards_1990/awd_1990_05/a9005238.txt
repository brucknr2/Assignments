Abstract    :
                   Isostatically compensated, tectonically thickened                         
              lithosphere in a compressional orogen has a tendency to spread                 
              laterally under the influence of gravity.  Whether or not forces               
              are sufficient to produce extensional deformation in a specific                
              compressional setting depends on a number of factors.  This                    
              project will evaluate the possibility that Late Cretaceous                     
              extensional deformation may have played an important role in the               
              evolution of the convergent Sevier Orogen by study of two areas                
              where extension is suspected- The Funeral Mountains of                         
              southwestern California and the Britterroot dome of Idaho-                     
              Montana.  Research will focus on mapping, fabric analysis,                     
              geochronology, and PTt path geochemistry to attempt to document                
              the extent of Cretaceous extension.  Results will provide needed               
              data to identify the important factors controlling the existence               
              and degree of extension accompanying overall compressional                     
              tectonics.
