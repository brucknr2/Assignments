Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The principal investigator will extend (in both complex                   
              analytic and Lie theoretic directions) his previous work on                    
              analytically representing intersection cohomology of singular                  
              spaces by L2-cohomology.  In particular, he proposes to find                   
              complete Kaehler metrics on the smooth locus of projective                     
              varieties whose L2-cohomology represents the intersection                      
              cohomology of the singular variety.                                            
                   The principal investigator will extend ideas used in his                  
              solution to the Zucker conjecture to the case of complete Kaehler              
              metrics.  This conjecture stated that except in certain specified              
              cases, the L2- and intersection cohomology were essentially the                
              same.  Cohomology is the dual of homology.  Thus, cohomology                   
              consists of a sequence of groups of functions which are tied                   
              together by a sequence of "co-boundary" functions.  These                      
              structures have been used to catalog hypersurfaces of many                     
              dimensions.
