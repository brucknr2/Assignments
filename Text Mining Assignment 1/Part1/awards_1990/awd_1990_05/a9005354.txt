Abstract    :
                   This research will further develop a three-dimensional                    
              chronostratigraphic framework of a carbonate platform, and,                    
              secondly, to extract a platform flooding history (relative sea                 
              level curve) from a high energy, windward bank margin.  The                    
              extremely successful magnetostratigraphic dating of four 60-m                  
              cores from Little Bahama Bank is beginning to unravel the nature               
              of platform deposition.  This dating technique has renewed                     
              interest and understanding of carbonate platform depositional                  
              models and has extended age control beyond the Late Pleistocene                
              and Holocene.  The new Little Bahama Bank chronostratigraphy                   
              reveals a considerably different depositional sequence than                    
              proposed from just lithostratigraphy.  This project will                       
              complete the remaining cores from the platform and extend                      
              downward the existing reversal stratigraphy to achieve the first               
              three-dimensional platform history.  The second part of this                   
              project will consist of dating three cores from the eastern side               
              of Great Bahama Bank, part of a  high-energy/bank interior facies              
              that preserves a record of platform flooding (regional sea level               
              curve) events.
