Abstract    :
              This project will conduct an international conference in                       
              Nondestructive Evaluation of materials and structures.  The                    
              objective is to bring together the researchers practitioners,                  
              designers and to collect the information available on the equipment            
              and application of nondestructive evaluation methods for                       
              construction materials and large structures.  Proceedings will be              
              published and widely distributed.
