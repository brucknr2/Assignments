Abstract    :
                   The problems in gravitational physics to be studied can be                
              presented under six headings:  classical gravity and cosmology,                
              quantum cosmology, technical issues relevant to quantization of                
              gravity, spin and statistics of quantum particles, dynamical                   
              change of spacetime topology, and a discrete model for                         
              spacetime.  These address very fundamental aspects of                          
              gravitation theory.                                                            
                   More specifically, the investigators will study:                          
              gravitational conservation laws, "topological cosmic                           
              censorship," properties of exponentially expanding universes;                  
              consequences of using elapsed 4-volume as a time-parameter for                 
              quantum cosmology; the implications of coordinate and gauge                    
              invariance for different quantization schemes, formulation of                  
              the Einstein equations on light-like hyper-surfaces as well as                 
              at large spatial distances; a possible topological proof of the                
              spin-statistics correlation, and its implications for quantum                  
              gravity; field fluctuations in spacetimes whose topology                       
              changes, the splitting off from our universe of regions of non-                
              trivial topology; and the possibility of adopting a discrete                   
              model for spacetime in which the basic relation is a partial                   
              order, the reformulation of topological and metrical notions in                
              this framework, and the subsequent search for a classical                      
              limit.
