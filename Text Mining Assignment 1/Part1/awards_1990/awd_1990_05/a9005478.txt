Abstract    :
                   Models for emplacement of large thrust sheets make                        
              simplifying assumptions regarding fault properties and presence                
              of simultaneous slip over the entire fault surface.  In an actual              
              thrust system fault characteristics vary from fault to fault and               
              from one place to the next along and across strike, reflecting                 
              changes in mechanics of the fault system and variations of                     
              conditions within individual fault zones.  This research will                  
              address the complexities of fault deformation in the Mountain                  
              City Window of Tennessee, and the along-strike variations of                   
              fault zones and how these variations in fault behavior have                    
              influenced the overall geometry of the thrust system.  Results                 
              will contribute to developing more realistic models for thrust                 
              development.
