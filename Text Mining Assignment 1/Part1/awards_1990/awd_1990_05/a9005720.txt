Abstract    :
                   The nature of the mechanical behavior of high-grade,                      
              isotropic basement rocks that allow them to accommodate the fold               
              shapes of sedimentary cover sequences is a problem common to many              
              orogens.  This renewal will continue research on several examples              
              of such folds in the Rocky Mountain foreland.  This work will                  
              synthesize existing data on the fold geometry and detailed                     
              kinematic information of these examples.  Results are expected to              
              be applicable to a number of orogens containing basement-cored                 
              folds.
