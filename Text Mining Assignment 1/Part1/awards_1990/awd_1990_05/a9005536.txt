Abstract    :
              In this study, experiments will be conducted to determine the                  
              position of the jarosite and natrojarosite stability fields as                 
              functions of the H2SO4-K2SO4 and H2SO4-Na2SO4 Concentration in                 
              the coexisting aqueous phase.  Experimental Temperatures will                  
              range from 200oC to the upper stability limit of jarosite and                  
              natrojarosite, which is expected to be below 450oC.  In addition,              
              the partitioning of sodium and potassium between jarosite and                  
              aqueous sulfate solutions, the D fractionation between the                     
              hydroxyl sites of jarosite and water, and 18O fractionation                    
              between the jarosite hydroxyl and sulfate sites and water will be              
              measured.  These experiments, which will be conducted in standard              
              cold-seal hydrothermal vessels at a pressure of 500 bars, are an               
              extension of work in progress on alunite to a ferric-iron bearing              
              system.  They should improve our ability to interpret isotope                  
              data on acid-sulfate alteration, which frequently includes both                
              alunite and jarosite.  In addition, they will help to constrain                
              the chemical and isotope systematics of jarosite at lower                      
              temperatures, and thus complement ongoing studies of jarosite at               
              25oC.  A better understanding of the properties of jarosite at                 
              surficial conditions will be important in the study of acid-mine               
              drainage, and also in the interpretation of natural weathering                 
              and oxidation of pyritic ore deposits.
