Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal requests funds to help pay international travel and              
              accommodation costs of North American scientists participating in the          
              Fourth International Conference on Phloem Transport and Assimilate             
              Compartmentation.  The conference will be held in Cognac, France from          
              August 19 through 24, 1990.  Scientists will focus on the specific             
              processes that are involved in orchestrating the development of the            
              long-distance transport system of the plant (the phloem in particular)         
              and form a framework for the integration of events from the cellular,          
              tissue and whole plant level.  The last conference in this series, held        
              at Asilomar, California, focussed on the controversies surrounding the         
              interpretation of experimental data.  Since then, the emergence of             
              plant molecular biology has provided new avenues by which to study the         
              phloem and these approaches will be presented for discussion at the            
              Cognac meeting.  In addition, the program is designed to integrate             
              structural, physiological and biophysical studies in a manner that             
              should potentiate conceptual and experimental advances.                        
                                                                                             
              The format of the Cognac meeting has been designed to allow those who          
              attend to be exposed to related areas of translocation.  The meeting           
              will be a true "workshop" in that the program contains a balance of            
              invited special lectures, formal group discussions on predetermined            
              topics, group discussions on topics identified by conference                   
              participants as being in need of research focus (so called trouble             
              spots), review periods during which the international representatives          
              from each country will discuss strategies that will foster and                 
              encourage the coordination of research efforts in this important area          
              of plant biology.
