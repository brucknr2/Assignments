Abstract    :
                   The Cascadia convergent margin, which flanks the western                  
              side of Oregon, Washington and Vancouver Island, marks the                     
              subduction boundary between North America and the Juan de Fuca                 
              plate.  The forearc region is underlain by lower Eocene basalt                 
              except in Olympic Peninsula section where uplift has tilted the                
              basalt into a sleep east-plunging anticline and has exposed the                
              underlying Olympic subduction complex.  This research will                     
              continue a project aimed at understanding this anomalous uplift                
              and its causes.  Results are important to the timing and geometry              
              of the Olympic subduction complex and has application to                       
              understanding other ancient subduction complexes.
