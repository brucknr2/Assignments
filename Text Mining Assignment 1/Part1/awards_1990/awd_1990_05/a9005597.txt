Abstract    :
                   This research is concerned with non-commutative ring theory.  The         
              principal investigator will apply algebraic K-theory and cyclic homology       
              to the study of group rings and crossed products.  In addition, he will        
              investigate special dimension functions in ring theory with particular         
              emphasis on global dimension and Gelfand-Kirillov dimension.                   
                   A ring is an algebraic object having both an addition and a               
              multiplication defined on it.  These structures arise naturally in many        
              different settings and are of interest in mathematics, computer science,       
              engineering and physics.
