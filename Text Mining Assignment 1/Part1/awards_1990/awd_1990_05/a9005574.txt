Abstract    :
              Carotenoids are essential components of the photosynthetic                     
              apparatus of bacteria, algae and higher plants and serve                       
              critical roles in light-harvesting and protection against                      
              photosensitized oxidations.  Although the roles of carotenoids                 
              in light-harvesting and photoprotection are clearly                            
              established, the details of the excited singlet and triplet                    
              energy transfer reactions required for these are poorly                        
              understood.  Drs. Albrecht and Owens propose to investigate the                
              in vivo photophysics of photosynthetic carotenoids in several                  
              bacterial and algal pigment-protein complexes.  Primary                        
              emphasis will be placed on providing a mechanistic description                 
              of singlet energy transfer from carotenoids to chlorophylls.                   
              Ultrafast absorption spectroscopy will be used to study the                    
              dynamics of singlet and triplet transfer reactions and to                      
              identify heterogeneous carotenoid function.  Resonance Raman                   
              techniques, including Raman excitation profiles, will be used                  
              to probe heterogeneous carotenoid functions in vivo.
