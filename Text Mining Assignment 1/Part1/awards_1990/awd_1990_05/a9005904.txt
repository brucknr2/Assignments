Abstract    :
                   This research will focus on the development of static and                 
              dynamic graphical tools to aid in making inferences from                       
              statistical models.  One of the primary methods for this work is               
              the display of two-dimensional projections of contours of a                    
              function of many parameters.  This method was introduced as a                  
              technique for inference in nonlinear regression but it can be                  
              applied to any statistical model where an objective function,                  
              such as a likelihood or posterior density, is associated with the              
              parameters.                                                                    
                   This project is in the general area of statistics and                     
              computational mathematics.  The graphical modeling has                         
              application in chemical engineering, pharmacokinetics, food                    
              science, polymer science and chemical kinetics.
