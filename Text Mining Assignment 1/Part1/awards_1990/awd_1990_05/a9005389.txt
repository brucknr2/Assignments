Abstract    :
              Several years ago the council of the Geochemical Society                       
              conceived the plan to initiate joint meetings of major                         
              geochemical societies to foster cooperation between scientists,                
              in particular to develop stronger ties with the European                       
              scientific community. The longer range goal is to hold meetings                
              organized in alternate years by European and the United States-                
              based societies.                                                               
              The very  positive feedback from the participants of the first                 
              Goldschmidt Conference, which was organized by the Geochemical                 
              Society in 1988 to mark the Centennial Year of  V.M.                           
              Goldschmidt's birth, encouraged the council of the Geochemical                 
              Society to proceed with organizing bianial Goldschmidt                         
              Conferences.  The second conference will be held from May 2 to 4,              
              1990 in Baltimore, Maryland.
