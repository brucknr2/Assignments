Abstract    :
                   PI will investigate the animal sediment relations and                     
              biogenic sedimentary structures of palagic carbonate systems in                
              both shelf-sea and deep-sea settings.  Emphasis will be on                     
              interpreting the environmentally controlled trace fossil                       
              associations, ichnofabrics (modes of occurrence, preservation,                 
              deformation and juxtaposition of trace fossils) and paleoethology              
              (fossilized evidence of animal behavior) preserved in pelagic                  
              deposits in New Zealand and Denmark.  Palagic sediment is ideal                
              for such studies, because (a) bioturbation rates typically far                 
              exceed depositional rates, (b) pelagic ooze occurs in regimes far              
              removed from direct perturbations of continental sediment influx,              
              and (c) the open-water setting allows for global comparisons and               
              synthesis.                                                                     
                   Similarities and differences of ichnofabric, ichnofacies and              
              particular ethologic types of trace fossils will be documented in              
              pelagic limestone and chalk deposited in mid-latitude boreal seas              
              of the Southern and Northern Hemispheres during Late Cretaceous                
              and Early Tertiary time.  The work will focus on the                           
              Maastrichtian-Oligocene Amuri Limestone on the South Island of                 
              New Zealand and Maastrichtian-Paleocene chalk in Denmark.  In                  
              addition, DSDP/ODP and commercial drill cores of deep-sea                      
              carbonate sections from nearby sites in the southwestern Pacific               
              and northeastern Atlantic will be examined.  This ichnologic                   
              research will provide a detailed picture of organism-substrate                 
              interrelationships in ancient pelagic ooze habitats, and it also               
              will allow construction of a global picture of endobenthic                     
              communities in non-tropical, mid-latitude, epicratonic sea-bottom              
              environments.
