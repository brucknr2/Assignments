Abstract    :
              Support is provided to enable graduate students and                            
              researchers without travel support to attend the bi-annual                     
              Gordon Research Conference on Tribology.  The topic of the                     
              conference is "Recent Advances in Microscopic and Macroscopic                  
              Tribology".  The conference attempts to bring together, in                     
              an informal environment, the two major sub-cultures of the                     
              tribology community: researchers who approach the subject                      
              from the traditional macroscopic point of view and                             
              researchers who employ recently developed microscopic and                      
              atomic-level techniques of observation and modeling.
