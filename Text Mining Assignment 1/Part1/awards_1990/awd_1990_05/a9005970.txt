Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                         On 17 October 1989 the buildings of Moss Landing                   
              Marine Laboratories were destroyed by the magnitude 7.1 Loma                   
              Prieta earthquake.  Evidence at the time pointed to                            
              liquefaction of the sand under the facility as the cause.                      
              After a cruise on which side-scan sonar images and Uniboom                     
              seismic records were obatined adjacent the site of the labs it                 
              was realized that large scale slumping of the seafloor played a                
              major role in the destruction.                                                 
                         That slumping is evidenced by a series of slump                     
              scars and liquefaction sediment lobes that indicate movement of                
              a large region in the direction of the nearby head of Monterey                 
              Canyon.  This project will study the evidence of the submarine                 
              slumps and associated liquefaction sediment lobes before the                   
              evidence is obscured by winter storms.  A shipboard program                    
              will collect repetitive side-scan surveys of the shallow areas                 
              of slumping, extend the previous side-scan survey to include                   
              the walls of the canyon, and sample the sediment lobes and                     
              slumps.  Direct observations will be made in shallow water by                  
              divers primarily for the purpose of establishing the effects on                
              benthic ecology and for comparisions with seasonal cycles.
