Abstract    :
                   This award provides funding to upgrade the automation of an               
              old, but serviceable, X-ray spectrograph operated in the                       
              Department of Geology-Geography at the University of                           
              Massachusetts in Amherst.                                                      
                   The instrument is the backbone of the Regional X-Ray                      
              Analytical Facility at the University of Massachusetts which                   
              serves the research needs for multi-element chemical analysis of               
              rocks and minerals of the geochemistry community in much of New                
              England.
