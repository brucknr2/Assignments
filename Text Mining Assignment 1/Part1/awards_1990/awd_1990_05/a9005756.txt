Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Dr. Gerhart is requesting funds for the travel of speakers                     
              invited to the 49th annual symposium of the Society for                        
              Developmental Biology, which will be held June 28-30, 1990 at                  
              Georgetown University in Washington D.C. The subject of the                    
              symposium is "Cell-cell interactions in early development".                    
              Speakers will describe developmentally important interactions in               
              a variety of embryos (Drosophila, C. elegans, sea urchins,                     
              vertebrates), in slime molds (Dictyostelium), and in plants, as                
              analyzed by molecular, genetic, and embryological methods. Other               
              speakers will discuss cell biological and molecular aspects of                 
              receptor function (for growth factors) and signal transduction as              
              studied in cell culture model systems, which are likely to have                
              relevance to embryological studies. The meeting is usually of                  
              medium size (300-400 registrants) with a single platform session               
              held at a time (25-30 speakers), and with 60-80 posters. It is                 
              attended by graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and senior                
              researchers. Most speakers have agreed to prepare summaries of                 
              their presentations for publication in the annual symposium                    
              volume.                                                                        
              %%%                                                                            
              Progress in the area of cell-cell interactions in early                        
              development have been substantial in the last few years and it is              
              therefore valuable to hold such a symposium to discuss and                     
              disseminate information on the status of the field.
