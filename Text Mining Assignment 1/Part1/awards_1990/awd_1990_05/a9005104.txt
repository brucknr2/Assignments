Abstract    :
                   Work on this project focuses on questions arising in the                  
              mathematical theory of several complex variables.  The research                
              concerns the nature of mappings between domains in spaces of                   
              several complex variables - possibly of different dimension.  A                
              specific problem of interest is that of constructing maps from                 
              balls of different dimension which are proper and holomorphic.                 
              Proper means effectively that the mappings look finite-to-one                  
              locally.  The maps are to be in certain Lipschitz classes up to                
              the boundary.  This degree of smoothness has yet to be obtained;               
              the best result to date assumes differentiability up to the                    
              boundary.  In such a case, the only mappings turn out to be                    
              rational.                                                                      
                   If the first domain is not a ball, then the target domain in              
              general cannot be a ball.  A more likely target is the unit                    
              sphere of a Hilbert space.  In such cases, pseudoconvex domains                
              with analytic boundaries can be mapped by proper maps.  This                   
              project will go further in lowering the condition on the boundary              
              to demonstrate that differentiable proper maps can be obtained.
