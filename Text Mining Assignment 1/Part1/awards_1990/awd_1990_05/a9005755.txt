Abstract    :
                   The objective of this research is to develop a real-time                  
              intelligent assembly system which integrates the operations from               
              the assembly design process to the optimal assembly schedule                   
              generation.  The goals of the research are:  (1) obtain the                    
              precedence knowledge of the assembled object automatically                     
              either from a rule-based system, or from neural network learning               
              schemes;  (2) find the mapping between the precedence knowledge                
              and investigated neural networks; (3) generate the optimal                     
              assembly schedule based on the mapping between the precedence                  
              knowledge and the network and algorithms; and (4) implement a                  
              systematic intelligent assembly system which integrates the                    
              design process and the generation of the optimal assembly                      
              schedule.  The system is applicable to automobile assembly,                    
              electronic circuit board assembly, industrial flexible                         
              manufacturing and other fields related to the                                  
              precedence-constraint planning and scheduling problems.
