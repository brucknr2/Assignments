Abstract    :
                   Probabilities of excitation by electron impact on the 21S                 
              and 23S metastable levels of atomic helium, to a large number                  
              of higher levels in the n1S, n1P, n1D, n3S, n3P and n3D                        
              series, are measured, with the objective of understanding the                  
              basic physics of collisional interactions with metastable                      
              atoms.  Cross sections for ionization out of the 21S and 23S                   
              metastable levels are also measured.
