Abstract    :
                   Tools will be developed for assessing sensitivity of results              
              to assumptions about the prior probability distribution (which                 
              represents knowledge gained from sources other than the data                   
              being analyzed). A deeper understanding of the role of                         
              parameterization of statistical models will be gained through the              
              development of diagnostics for the detection of a poor                         
              approximation by a Normal distribution to another distribution.                
              The focus will be the approximation of the posterior distribution              
              which is the basis for inference in a Bayesian analysis.                       
              Appropriate numerical integration strategies will be incorporated              
              in a computing environment for Bayesian analysis. Further work                 
              will be carried out on asymptotic Bayesian inference for                       
              nonparametric problems in which the assumptions of the                         
              statistical model are greatly weakened.
