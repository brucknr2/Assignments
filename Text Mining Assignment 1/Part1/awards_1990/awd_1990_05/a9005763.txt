Abstract    :
                   Several related investigations in high energy atomic                      
              physics will be undertaken.  These phenomena all occur under                   
              conditions in which electron correlation effects are                           
              unimportant.  In contrast, relativistic, retardation and higher                
              multipole effects are more prominent than the more usual                       
              regimes of atomic physics.  Specific studies include Compton                   
              scattering of photons from bound atomic electrons, relativistic                
              atomic bremsstrahlung radiation from target structure in ion-                  
              atom collisions, the anomalous scattering regime of Rayleigh                   
              scattering and the structure of radiation transition multipole                 
              moments.  Longer range projects include the triply differential                
              cross section for electron-atom bremsstrahlung, extension of                   
              current computer codes to incorporate a more realistic                         
              treatment of exchange and correlations and an independent                      
              particle calculation of Delbruck scattering.  Both numerical                   
              and analytical methods will be utilized.  Training of students                 
              and international cooperative activities are integral parts of                 
              all of the research activities.
