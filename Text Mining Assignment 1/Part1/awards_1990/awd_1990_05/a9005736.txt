Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary objective of this U.S.-Poland research                             
              project between Dr. Richard Hetnarski of the Rochester                         
              Institute of Technology and Dr. Jozef Ignaczak of the                          
              Polish Institute of Fundamental Technology Research is                         
              to analyze wave propagation in generalized thermoelastic                       
              solids.  The researchers hope to gain a better                                 
              understanding of interactions between the mechanical and                       
              thermal fields in a continuum.  Efforts will emphasize                         
              fundamental work pertaining to temperature-rate dependent                      
              thermoelasticity (TRDT) theory and nonlinear dynamic                           
              coupled thermoelasticity (NDCT) theory.  Results are                           
              expected to contribute to our basic knowledge of the                           
              principles underlying high-temperature superconductivity                       
              and semiconductor processing.                                                  
                                                                                             
              This engineering project in solid mechanics fulfills the                       
              program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by                         
              enabling leading experts in the United States and                              
              Eastern Europe to combine compelmentary talents and pool                       
              research resources in areas of strong mutual interest                          
              and competence.
