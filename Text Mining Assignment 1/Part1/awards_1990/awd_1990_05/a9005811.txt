Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research analyzes the changes in the official Chinese                     
              attitude towards traditional Tibetan medicine as functions of                  
              changes in the larger social-political context of Tibet within                 
              Chinese society.  The study will examine the role of traditional               
              medicine in Tibet through analysis of health policy and the                    
              social organization of healing institutions.  Methods include                  
              systematic interviews with officials in the ministry of health,                
              interviews with and observations of practitioners and of patients              
              of traditional as well as modern medicine, and observation of a                
              sample of practitioner-patient interactions.                                   
                                                                                             
              This project is important because it will analyze a case of                    
              medical pluralism that has generalizing implications for other                 
              social situations where cultures are in contact.  For example,                 
              understanding the issues of medical behavior in this Tibetan case              
              can sensitize planners to important issues in the design of                    
              treatment regimes for other multi-cultural medical situations,                 
              such as the American southwest.
