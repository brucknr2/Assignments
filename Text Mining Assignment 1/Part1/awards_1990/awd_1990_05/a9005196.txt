Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The first objective of this work is to develop regenerable                     
              polymeric reagents for asymmetric reductions.  The                             
              reagents will be complexes of optically active (chiral)                        
              helical polymers and borane.  These polymers are                               
              conveniently synthesized by living anionic polymerization                      
              techniques using chiral initiators.  An example of such an                     
              optically active polymer is poly (phenyl-2-pyridyl-o-                          
              tolylmethylmethacrylate).  The presence of the 2-pyridyl                       
              groups in the polymer should allow for the preparation of                      
              the optically active polymer/borane complexes similar to                       
              poly (2-vinylpyridine)/borane complexes.  The optically                        
              active reducing reagents will be used to reduce prochiral                      
              carbonyl functionalities.  The second objective of the                         
              project is to synthesize a class of isotactic polymers                         
              which will exhibit specific secondary structures i.e.                          
              helix.  This goal will be accomplished by first developing                     
              an understanding of the relationship between the structure                     
              of the monomer and the tendency to isotactic specific                          
              polymerization.  The starting point of this project will                       
              be the synthesis and stereochemical characterization of                        
              poly (4-vinylquinoline) and poly (2-vinylnaphthalene).  It                     
              is expected that such isotactic polymers with specific                         
              secondary structures or "steric-stereoregular" polymers                        
              will have potential applications in molecular biology,                         
              synthetic enzymes and regenerable asymmetric reagents.//
