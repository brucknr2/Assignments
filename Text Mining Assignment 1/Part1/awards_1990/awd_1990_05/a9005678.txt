Abstract    :
              This is a proposal to continue the development of robust                       
              systems for automated drug delivery.  The emphasis is on                       
              combining technology used in chemical industry to control                      
              multiple outputs by multiple inputs with expert systems                        
              methodology that assesses patient state and selects                            
              initial drug infusion rate.  The project depends heavily                       
              on cross-disciplinary interaction of team members with                         
              expertise in anesthesiology, biomedical engineering, and                       
              control engineering.  The project has the promise of                           
              advancing the technology of controlling biological                             
              systems, and it may also eventually contribute to improved                     
              management of anesthesia.
