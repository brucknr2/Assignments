Abstract    :
              An area diffractometer for crystallography has been installed at               
              x-ray beamline X12-C at the National Synchrotron Light Source at               
              Brookhaven National Laboratory.   The diffractometer that was                  
              chosen was the FAST by ENraf/Nonius of Delft, The Nether-lands.                
                                                                                             
              Several projects are proposed to exploit the multi-wavelength                  
              phasing methods.  Also, there is a tremendous pressure for use of              
              the diffractometer among the existing community of                             
              crystallographers who have used film methods at the beamline.                  
              This pressure will drive the development of standardized but                   
              flexible methods for data collection and reduction.                            
                                                                                             
              Funds are requested for an additional computer for use in this                 
              development project.
