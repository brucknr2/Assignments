Abstract    :
              An excimer-dye laser, with frequency doubling, and a transient                 
              digitizer for fluorescence intensity measurements are                          
              requested, to be used for studies of chromium species                          
              oxidation, reduction and oxide-halide partitioning kinetics in                 
              the 300-1900 K temperature range.  Several unique experimental                 
              facilities are involved.  The principal one is a high                          
              temperature fast-flow reactor with laser-induced fluorescence                  
              monitoring of the Cr radicals.  Additionally, the metals high-                 
              temperature photochemistry reactors, development of which                      
              began under a previous NSF program, will be employed.  This                    
              apparatus allows a check on the flow reactor results and an                    
              extension of the 10-2 to 10-1 bar pressure range to 1 bar.  A                  
              second flow reactor with mass spectrometer detection will be                   
              utilized to help identify the reaction products.                               
                                                                                             
              The proposed research is needed for understanding the role of                  
              Cr species reactions in the formation of hazardous emissions                   
              in waste incineration.  Additionally, the equipment will be                    
              utilized on several other combustion projects.
