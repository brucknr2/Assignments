Abstract    :
              Existing volcanic eruption models need to be superceded by a more              
              adequate modelling, since many observations of eruption columns,               
              blasts and related phenomena still lack theoretical explanation.               
              Careful theoretical analyses are essential to provide                          
              explanations against which field observations may be tested, and               
              to provide the stimulus for new, insightful approaches to field                
              investigation.  Accurate modelling is now feasible due to                      
              availability of advanced numerical techniques and supercomputers.              
              We therefore propose to develop a rigorous unified computational               
              model for volcanic eruptions involving:  three-dimensional,                    
              unsteady, turbulent, compressible, thermoviscous, multiphase                   
              radiating flow, with interaction from extraneous water, arbitrary              
              cross-wind profiles, stratified humid atmosphere, and realistic                
              ground topography.  Vent orientation and shape will be arbitrary.              
              This grant will partially support a graduate student who will                  
              participate in the development of this model under the                         
              supervision of the two PIs.
