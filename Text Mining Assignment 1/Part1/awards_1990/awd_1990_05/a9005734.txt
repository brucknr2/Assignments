Abstract    :
              The long term objectives of this research are to understand                    
              hydrogen metabolism during the anaerobic growth of bacteria in                 
              terms of the enzymatic mechanisms of H2 activation, the catalytic              
              roles of nickel and non-heme iron, the number and structure of                 
              hydrogenases, the mechanisms of their cellular localizations,                  
              the insertion of metal redox centers and the roles of                          
              hydrogenases in the bioenergetics of anaerobic bacteria.                       
              Hydrogenase and H2 are of general biological and                               
              biotechnological importance as they are intimately involved in                 
              dinitrogen fixation, the photoproduction of H2 from water,                     
              complex microbial fermentations useful for the production of                   
              fuels and chemicals, and as normal flora of the intestinal tracts              
              of higher animals.  The specific aims of the proposed research                 
              are: to obtain an x-ray crystallographic structure of the nickel-              
              containing hydrogenases; to define the structure of the nickel-                
              containing active site and the three iron non-heme iron clusters;              
              to further refine the activation and catalytic cycles involved in              
              H2 utilization; to develope a DNA transfer system for the sulfate              
              reducing bacteria; to use this system for the biosynthesis of                  
              active hydrogenases with recombinant DNA; to prepare modified                  
              hydrogenases by site-directed mutagenesis and study from the                   
              sulfate reducing bacteria their biochemical properties; and to                 
              establish the roles of multiple hydrogenases in selected                       
              anaerobic microorganisms.
