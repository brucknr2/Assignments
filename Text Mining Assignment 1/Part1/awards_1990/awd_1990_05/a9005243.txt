Abstract    :
                   This award provides one-half the funds required for the                   
              acquisition of a digitized microscope system that will be used                 
              for research in the Department of Geological Sciences at Brown                 
              University. The University will be providing the remaining funds.              
                   The microscope system will be devoted to data acquisition in              
              petrological research involving the study of strain and volume                 
              loss associated with the metamorphism of sediments accreted at                 
              convergent plate boundaries, and will also be used in fission                  
              track dating applications.
