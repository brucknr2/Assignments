Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Spectral methods have been widely applied to the study of                      
              transient and turbulent flows, yet their scope of application                  
              has been limited by their inability to treat discontinuous                     
              problems on nonsmooth domains.  This project will serve to reduce              
              these two restrictions.  It will design oscillation-free spectral              
              methods to simulate chemically reacting flows, especially the                  
              detonation waves and the transition from deflagration to                       
              detonation.  Spectral shock fitting methods will be applied to                 
              study the interaction of a detonation wave and disturbances.                   
              Essentially non-oscillatory approximations will be used to                     
              resolve the high gradients and discontinuities in the solutions.               
              The domain restrictions will be eased by combining the spectral                
              element methods with the p- and the h-p version of the finite                  
              element method.  Then the combined method will be applied to                   
              general elliptic equations on nonsmooth domains, and the results               
              will be used to simulate flows in irregular channels.
