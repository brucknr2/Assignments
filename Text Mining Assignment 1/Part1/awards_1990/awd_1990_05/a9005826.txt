Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Acquired immunity to Leishmaniasis is cell mediated (CMI)                      
              (4.5).  Two subpopulation of CD4+T cells determine the                         
              outcome of disease by Leishmania infection.  Cure in                           
              genetically resistant mice and immunity in vaccinated                          
              susceptible BALB/c H-2K mice correlates with the presence                      
              of a high frequency of Thy2+ CD4+T cell subsets (6.9).                         
                                                                                             
              These observations raise the following questions:  (i)                         
              What T cell epitopes are involved in the activation of                         
              protective versus disease promoting TH subsets?, and, (ii)                     
              What are the properties of the different T cell epitopes?,                     
              and, (iii) How do these epitopes influence the interaction                     
              of the MHC (Ia) molecule with the TCRa/B in order to                           
              selectively activate a TH subset?                                              
                                                                                             
              The above questions are amenable to investigation using                        
              Leishmania antigens.  This is because, there are candidate                     
              Leishmania strain and stage specific antigens that either                      
              induce protective immunity or exacerbate disease by                            
              selectively activating a specific subset of primed TH                          
              cells (7,10,14).  Therefore, we propose that the                               
              expression of the antigens is regulated in a stage and                         
              strain specific manner.  The identification of these                           
              antigens and their genes from stage and strain specific                        
              cDNA library is possible.  Sequence information and T cell                     
              proliferative assay would lead to the identification  of                       
              the T cell epitopes.  The presence of a relevant animal                        
              model, with a wealth of immunological information will                         
              facilitate the establishment of the relationship between                       
              antigen structure and function in vivo.
