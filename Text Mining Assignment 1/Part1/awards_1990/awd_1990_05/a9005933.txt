Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              LAPACK is a linear algebra library for high-performance computers.             
              The first release, targeted at shared memory machines, will be                 
              available at the end of 1990, and is already attracting significant            
              interest both from the potential user community and from                       
              manufacturers.  This research is concerned with extending still                
              further the usefulness of LAPACK by increasing the functionality               
              through additional linear algebra capability, and by increasing the            
              user community through targeting a wider range of high-performance             
              architectures, providing additional language versions, and                     
              exploiting clean computer arithmetic.                                          
                                                                                             
              The extensions include new subroutines useful in systems and control           
              theory such as solving Sylvester equations and generalized singular            
              value decomposition, new algorithms for certain eigenproblems which            
              are much more accurate than any algorithms in EISPACK, accommodating           
              distributed-memory architectures, versions of several subroutines to           
              exploit special properties of some computer arithmetics (especially            
              IEEE arithmetic), and Fortran 8X and C language versions of some of            
              the most important subroutines.                                                
                                                                                             
              LAPACK includes a comprehensive set of testing and timing routines.            
              These will be used as a basis for the design and development of a              
              systematic performance analysis package for the common algorithms of           
              linear algebra.  This library will ease code development, make codes           
              more portable among machines of different architectures, increase              
              efficiency, provide tools for evaluating computer performance.
