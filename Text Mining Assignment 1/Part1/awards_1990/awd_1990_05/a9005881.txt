Abstract    :
                   In this project the principal investigator will continue                  
              his studies of singularity formation and roll-up for vortex                    
              sheets in two and three space dimensions.  For the two-                        
              dimensional case he will construct models of vortex-sheet roll-                
              up, while for the three-dimensional case he will investigate axi-              
              symmetric vortex sheets with swirl.  Such flow phenomena arise in              
              a number of physical contexts such as the mixing of flows and                  
              flows around airfoils, and their elucidation is of prime concern               
              to fluid dynamicists and engineers.                                            
                   The next time you fly on a foggy day look at the wingtips of              
              the plane during take-offs and landings.  You should be able to                
              see conical swirls of air and mist shedding from the wing-tips                 
              and baffles on the wing.  These swirls are called "vortices" and               
              their presence on the wings is of prime concern to aircraft                    
              designers since they affect the drag and lift characteristics of               
              the airplane.  In this proposal the principal investigator will                
              study the formation, evolution and decay of such vortical                      
              structures in two and three space dimensions.
