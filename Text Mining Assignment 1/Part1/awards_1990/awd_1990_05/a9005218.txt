Abstract    :
                   Measurements of the density field of the ocean are necessary              
              to understand the circulation.  One of the principal instruments               
              for this measurement is a Conductivity/Temperature/Depth                       
              (CTD) device.  This proposal will provide an upgrade of the                    
              sensor suites on instruments to be used in the World Ocean                     
              Circulation Experiment (WOCE).  In addition, a van for                         
              measurement of oxygen and salinity in situ will be constructed.
