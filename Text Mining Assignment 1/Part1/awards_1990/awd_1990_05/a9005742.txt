Abstract    :
              Recent success in relating cation centroids in complex oxysalts                
              to metal centroids in intermetallics has motivated me to explore               
              complex structure types, some which occur in nature as large                   
              crystals, including dickinsonite, alluaudite, graftonite,                      
              griphite, triplite, triploidite and grischunite.  Why do such                  
              complex structures exist in phases which often form large                      
              crystals?  Dickinsonite structure type occurs in crystals up to                
              1 m3 and has 47 atoms in the asymmetric unit.  The PI plans to                 
              seek out appropriate cell transforms for these structures, and                 
              the appropriate intermetallic for comparison.  He hopes to                     
              predict the orientation of the lone pair, v, in an environment of              
              coordinating anions.  This exploits the fundamental Pauling                    
              electrostatic valence rules.  It is believed that this approach                
              will aid in sorting out the myriad plumbous oxysalt structures                 
              which are presently known.  Finally, the volumetric contribution               
              of v in the sulfosalt minerals can be rationalized.
