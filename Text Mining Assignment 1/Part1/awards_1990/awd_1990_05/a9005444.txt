Abstract    :
                   This is an isotopic and geochemical investigation of calcite              
              cements in the post-Miocene sequence of Enewetak Atoll.                        
              Preliminary carbon and oxygen isotope data from microsamples of                
              calcite cements within the Pliocene sequence of Core KAR-1 at                  
              Enewetak Atoll indicate that these cements were emplaced in                    
              meteoric phreatic lenses, while 87Sr/86Sr data places these                    
              diagenetic events in the Pleistocene and Pliocene.  The position               
              of paleophreatic lenses associated with these cements can provide              
              quantitative estimates of Pleistocene sea-level lowstands.                     
                   A combination of stable and radiogenic isotope data are needed            
              form calcite cements from Core KAR-1 and from age-equivalent                   
              sediments of Core OOR-17 to discriminate cement phases related to              
              successive and temporally separate paleophreatic lenses and to                 
              assess the stratigraphic distribution of individual phreatic cement            
              zones.  This "chemical cement" stratigraphy will allow multiple                
              episodes of phreatic cementation to be identified and their                    
              distribution documented.  Thus, this study offers an opportunity               
              to:  1) better understand the dynamics of the meteoric diagenetic              
              system during times of high frequency sea-level change, and 2)                 
              directly estimate the magnitude of Pleistocene sea-level lowstands             
              by monitoring the position of paleophreatic lenses.  Ultimately                
              this new sea level record can be used to calibrate the records of              
              sequence stratigraphy and foraminiferal delta 18O stratigraphy to              
              sea level.
