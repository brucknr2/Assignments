Abstract    :
                   This award provides one-half the funding required for the                 
              purchase of computing hardware and software that will be                       
              installed and operated in the Department of Geology and                        
              Geophysics at Rice University. The University is committed to                  
              providing the remaining funds necessary.                                       
                   The computing system upgrade is required for the processing               
              of seismic data for a number of Rice University research projects              
              in vertical-incidence and wide-angle reflection seismic                        
              processing, seismic interpretation and modeling of crustal                     
              structure.
