Abstract    :
                   Predictions of future climate require reliable General                    
              Circulation Models.  And the least reliable parameter estimated                
              by current GCMs is net moisture, precipitation less evaporation.               
              This proposal requests support to address this problem by                      
              developing new methods to reconstruct past moisture (P-E) and to               
              compare the results to calculated values of moisture from GCM                  
              simulations.  The PIs will develop a quantitative method for                   
              reconstructing past effective moisture (P-E) using diatom                      
              assemblages and ostracod geochemistry variations in 6-8 lakes                  
              which span the moisture gradients of the Great Plains.  Detailed               
              salinity fluctuations will be calibrated to the local                          
              meteorological records for the region to derive a unique transfer              
              function.  Then the transfer function will be used to reconstruct              
              the history of salinity in the Great Plains since the last                     
              glaciation.  This research is important because it will provide                
              more accurate estimates of past precipitation and evaporation in               
              this climatically sensitive region, and it will provide the best               
              baseline data to compare to GCM simulations of past climate.
