Abstract    :
              This grant is in the general area of analytical and surface                    
              chemistry and in the subfield of electroanalytical chemistry.                  
              Professor Anson will study the electrical properties of                        
              conducting polymers on electrode surfaces using a variety of                   
              electrochemical methods together with complementary                            
              measurements of mass and surface morphology.                                   
                                                                                             
              This research will involve several different projects all                      
              involving chemically modified electrodes.  A quartz crystal                    
              microbalance will be used to quantify changes in mass during                   
              electrochemical experiments involving explusion and uptake of                  
              ions.  Scanning electrochemical microscopy will be used to                     
              determine the surface features of active redox sites.  This                    
              research will contribute to the development and understanding                  
              of electrocatalytic systems.
