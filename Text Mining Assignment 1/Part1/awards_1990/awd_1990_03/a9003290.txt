Abstract    :
                   This project will involve the study of various variational                
              problems in dynamical systems and partial differential equations.              
              The basic problems studied include (a) three and n-body type                   
              problems, (b) the Weinstein conjecture, which concerns periodic                
              orbits on odd-dimensional compact manifolds, (c) the existence of              
              solutions to superlinear elliptic problems, and (d) elliptic                   
              variational problems involving the critical Sobolev exponent,                  
              including problems on contractible domains and curvature                       
              problems.                                                                      
                   In addition to making contributions in the areas of partial               
              differential equations and differential geometry, this work can                
              be applied to dynamical systems and potential theory.
