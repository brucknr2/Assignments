Abstract    :
                   Ferry will study a number of topics in controlled topology                
              and differential geometry.  Most of these problems bear on the                 
              problem, "How much control is enough to force simple homotopy                  
              equivalence between polyhedra or homeomorphism between                         
              topological manifolds?"  An interesting testing ground for                     
              controlled theories is on the borderline between topology and                  
              differential geometry, where there are problems which are                      
              obviously controlled in some way but for which there is no                     
              obvious control space.  Ferry has already solved one such problem              
              by, in some sense, letting the problem construct its own control               
              space.  He plans to explore further ramifications of these                     
              techniques.
