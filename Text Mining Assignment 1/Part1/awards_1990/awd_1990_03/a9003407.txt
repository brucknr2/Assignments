Abstract    :
              This is a post Loma Prieta earthquake (Oct. 1989)                              
              investigation project in learning from this damaging event.                    
                                                                                             
              This project studies one particular structure which faired                     
              remarkably well amidst similar buildings which suffered                        
              considerable damage during the earthquake.  The Clarion                        
              Hotel complex is located in a region where high ground                         
              accelerations were measured due to the soft soil conditions                    
              near the San Francisco Airport.  Interaction of the heavily                    
              reinforced pile foundation with the soil medium is                             
              suspected to have provided beneficial effects by mobilizing                    
              radiation and hysteretic damping.   In addition, the pile                      
              flexibility may have provided a longer period than present                     
              in a fixed base structure.                                                     
                                                                                             
              The effects of soil-pile-structure interaction on the                          
              performance of a portion of the hotel will be investigated                     
              using a complex response analysis in the frequency domain                      
              and a nonlinear time history analysis.  The analysis                           
              utilizes and extends a methodology developed earlier to                        
              focus on interaction effects in an actual case.                                
                                                                                             
              Important results expected include a comparison of the                         
              forces acting in the building and foundation elements as                       
              computed from the interactive and fixed base models, and                       
              an assessment of the period shift produced by pile                             
              flexibility.
