Abstract    :
              In the series of reactions comprising a metabolic sequence in cells            
              or living organism, one central question has long concerned                    
              biochemists.  Is a metabolite which is the product of one enzymic              
              reaction and the substrate for a succeeding enzymic reaction formed            
              and acted upon in a complex of the two proteins or is it produced              
              in the first system and then dissociated into the surrounding                  
              medium to be captured and utilized by the second?  This problem                
              will be attacked in two ways: (a) by the use of dynamic light                  
              scattering to study the diffusional properties of the components               
              of the system singly and together and by attempting to stabilize               
              the presumptive complex of the two proteins through photochemical              
              cross-linking.  The two systems studied will be the glycerol                   
              phosphate dehydrogenase and lactate dehydrogenase two enzymes which            
              have as a common metabolite, nicotinic-adenine-dinucleotide.
