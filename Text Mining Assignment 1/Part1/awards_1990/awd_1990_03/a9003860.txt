Abstract    :
                   Since 1983, the National Science Foundation has funded                    
              research with a phased-array HF radar at Goose Bay, Labrador.                  
              This radar was constructed by The Johns Hopkins University                     
              Applied Physics Laboratory to study the formation electron                     
              density irregularities in the E and F regions of the high -                    
              latitude plasma ionosphere and to study the lagre-scale structure              
              and dynamics of high-latitude convection.  This grant provides                 
              support for studying the dynamics of the convection response in                
              both the dayside and nightside ionosphere to changes in the                    
              interplanetary magnetic field and solar wind.  Additional                      
              projects to be studied include convections structures resulting                
              from oscillatory or transient magnetospheric boundary                          
              disturbances and the formation of high-latitude ionospheric                    
              irregularities.  A portion of the grant will be used to continue               
              to maintain a data base of continuous HF radar observations of                 
              the high-latitude ionosphere which will be available to other                  
              scientists.   ***
