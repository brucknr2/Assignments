Abstract    :
              The objective of this work is the use of dual wavelength doppler               
              radar to investigate the microphysical structure of                            
              thunderstorms forming over the Aericibo Observatory, particularly              
              the dependence of reflectivity upon particle spectra and the                   
              evolution of the latter throughout the life history of the storm.
