Abstract    :
              This is a post Loma Prieta earthquake (Oct. 1989)                              
              investigation project in learning from this damaging                           
              event.                                                                         
                                                                                             
              The ATC-20 "Procedures for Postearthquake Safety                               
              Evaluation of Buildings," published by Applied Technology                      
              Council (ATC) on September 19, 1989, were used extensively                     
              throughout Northern California to evaluate buildings                           
              damaged by the magnitude-7.1 October 17, 1989 Loma Prieta,                     
              California, earthquake.  The widespread application of the                     
              methodology on several thousand buildings by building                          
              officials and volunteer structural engineers from                              
              throughout the state has provided a rare and ideal                             
              opportunity to assess the merits and possible pitfalls of                      
              the methodology.                                                               
                                                                                             
              Based upon such an experience, this project will conduct a                     
              study to review, evaluate, and possibly revise the ATC-                        
              20.  The specific objectives are to: (1) document the                          
              application of the ATC-20 methodology; (2) conduct a                           
              workshop to review, expand, and evaluate this                                  
              documentation and develop recommendations for improved                         
              procedures; (3) develop and publish an addendum to the                         
              ATC-20 Report containing a summary of the Loma Prieta                          
              earthquake experience, a summary of the project workshop                       
              findings, additional instructions and clarifications for                       
              "difficult to determine" posting situations, and a                             
              recommended management program for local building                              
              officials; (4) revise and re-publish, if necessary, the                        
              ATC-20 Report and ATC-20-1 Field Manual; and (5) conduct                       
              training seminars that include an overview of the Loma                         
              Prieta experience.                                                             
                                                                                             
              This effort will enhance the methodology for safety                            
              evaluation of buildings following an earthquake.
