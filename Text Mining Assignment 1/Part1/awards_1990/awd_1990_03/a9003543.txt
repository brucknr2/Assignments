Abstract    :
                   This work will be concerned principally with the analysis of              
              classes of second order partial differential equations or partial              
              integrodifferential equations describing time-dependent                        
              phenomena.  In certain cases, good approximations to the                       
              solutions can be obtained by discarding the highest order time                 
              derivative in the equation.  Work will be done in justifying such              
              approximations by considering the effects of sending the highest               
              time derivative to zero.  For the short time behavior, one                     
              obtains a singular perturbation problem in which transient                     
              phenomena governed by a related equation should occur on a fast                
              time scale.  For the long time behavior, regular dependence of                 
              the time-asymptotic limit or - in cases of severe non-uniqueness               
              of stationary states - selection effects from the transient                    
              behavior are expected.  In this project, efforts will be made to               
              place some of these heuristic conjectures on a mathematically                  
              sound basis.  Work will also be done on questions of existence of              
              solutions for the reduced problems.                                            
                   Sources for the equations under study include mathematical                
              models describing shear flows for viscoelastic materials and                   
              polymerrheology.
