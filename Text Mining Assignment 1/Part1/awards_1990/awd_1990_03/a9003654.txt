Abstract    :
              This is a post Loma Prieta earthquake (Oct. 1989)                              
              investigation project in learning from this damaging                           
              event.                                                                         
                                                                                             
              The project will focus on the study of performance of                          
              unreinforced masonry buildings (UMR) during the                                
              earthquake.  Response of selected structures will be                           
              estimated using computational models, and correlated with                      
              expectations of structural strength and observations of                        
              damage.  The study will encompass buildings located in the                     
              counties of Alameda, Monterey, Santa Clara, Santa Cruz and                     
              San Francisco.  Both damaged and undamaged structures will                     
              be considered.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              The study will include a wide variety of masonry element                       
              types including structural walls resisting forces within                       
              and normal to their plane, infill panels in either steel                       
              or concrete frames, cladding, parapets, and other                              
              nonstructural elements.  Both engineered and nonengineered                     
              construction will be studied.  Candidate structures will                       
              be selected for investigation based on degree of damage,                       
              expected force level, location, soil conditions, and                           
              availability of information on ground motions and                              
              structural descriptions.                                                       
                                                                                             
              It is expected that knowledge gained will be helpful for                       
              mitigating the earthquake hazard in the eastern USA                            
              because of the widespread use of unreinforced masonry in                       
              those regions of a potential moderate intense earthquake.
