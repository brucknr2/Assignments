Abstract    :
              This project will provide logistical support for the launch of a               
              long duration balloon for the study of the isotopic composition of             
              heavy (iron group) cosmic rays.  The project is called MAGPIE:                 
              Magnetic Passive Isotope Experiment, and consists of special                   
              plastic sheets that can be etched to reveal tracks made by                     
              energetic cosmic rays.  The plastic is mounted in a strong                     
              magnetic field that is produced by a superconducting magnet.  The              
              experiment will determine the isotopic composition with                        
              unprecedented accuracy, and will thereby provide information on                
              the elemental makeup of the galaxy and the stellar processes which             
              produce all of the heavier elements.                                           
                                                                                             
              Due to the high geomagnetic latitude of Antarctica these fairly                
              low energy heavy ions will reach the atmosphere in much larger                 
              numbers than they would at mid-latitudes.  This, combined with the             
              lack of diurnal heating and cooling of the balloon, because of the             
              constant sunshine during the polar summer, makes long duration                 
              ballooning in Antarctica for cosmic ray research very attractive.              
                                                                                             
              The funds for the researchers and the launch of the balloon will               
              be provided by NASA.  NSF will provide logistical support and the              
              recovery of the payload.//
