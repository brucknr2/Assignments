Abstract    :
              Dr. Bezdek intends to extend the generalized fuzzy c-means (FCM)               
              clustering algorithm to include the Minkowsi norm family,                      
              suitable for detecting clusters in "boxy" data distributions.  He              
              will then elaborate the relationship between FCM and Kohonen's                 
              self-organizing feature maps, strengthing the theoretical                      
              foundations of each.  These advances will be tested against                    
              standard algorithms using data from medical image analysis                     
              (radionuclide angiocardiography, EEG brain maps) and multisensor               
              target detection.
