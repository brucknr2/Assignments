Abstract    :
                   This research involves the study of fitting statistical                   
              nonlinear regression models to data for which the response                     
              variance has been modeled as a function of the mean response and               
              other variables and possible unknown parameters which must be                  
              estimated from the data. Estimation will be studied for repeated               
              measures data in which the response variance varies within                     
              individuals.  A heteroscedastic random coefficient model                       
              containing a functional model for intra-individual variance with               
              unknown parameters to be estimated is considered. Systematic                   
              study of the implications of the theory of variance function                   
              estimation for data consisting of independent observations will                
              be conducted. Estimation for regression analysis with censored                 
              data will be studied when a variance function model is                         
              postulated. These models are applied to a detection limit problem              
              common in pharmaceutical applications.
