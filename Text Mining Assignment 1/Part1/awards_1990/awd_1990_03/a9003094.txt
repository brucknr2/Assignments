Abstract    :
                   A theoretical framework to calculate pressure-broadened                   
              halfwidths with an uncertainty of ~ 5% for atmospherically                     
              important species will be developed.  Calculations are also                    
              expected to yield pressure-induced line shifts.  Two approaches                
              to computing the halfwidth and line shift for water vapor                      
              perturbed by nitrogen or oxygen will be compared with                          
              experimental measurements, and the method that results in the                  
              best agreement will be used to generate a database for                         
              atmospherically important transitions of  water vapor.  Next, the              
              calculations will be extended to methane perturbed by nitrogen or              
              oxygen.  The research is motivated by the need for increased                   
              confidence in remote sensing measurements and a better                         
              determination of the radiative forcings of greenhouse gases.                   
              This investigation will lay the foundation for further                         
              calculations of halfwidths and line shifts for other atmospheric               
              species.
