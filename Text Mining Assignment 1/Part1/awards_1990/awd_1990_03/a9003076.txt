Abstract    :
                   Refined Languages (Refined Fortran, Refined C, etc.) are                  
              extensions of their parent languages in which it is possible to                
              express parallelism, but impossible to create races.  Where strictly           
              deterministic behavior is desired, multiple executions of a Refined            
              Fortran program with the same input data can be guaranteed to either           
              compute the same results or terminate with the same run-time errors            
              regardless of differences in scheduling.  Where asynchronous behavior          
              is desired, freedom from races can be guaranteed.  The Refined                 
              Languages approach achieves its goal by extending sequential                   
              imperative programming languages with data- (rather than control-)             
              oriented terms.                                                                
                   Specification of Refined ANSI Fortran `77, and construction of an         
              interprocedural Fortran `77 code analysis tool are complete.  This             
              award is to modify the specification to Fortran `8X, extend the                
              analysis tool into a Refined Fortran `8X compiler, and exploit the             
              special features of Refined Languages to construct a Refined Fortran           
              `8X symbolic debugger.  Formal study of the comparative expressive             
              powers of control-oriented parallel imperative languages and data-             
              oriented parallel imperative languages will ensue.
