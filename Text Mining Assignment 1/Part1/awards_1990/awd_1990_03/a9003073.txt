Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will continue his work on                      
              applications of probabilistic techniques in local times and                    
              classical function theory, especially Bloch functions, gamma star              
              functions, and lacunary series.                                                
                   The principal investigator will work at the interface                     
              between probability theory and classical function theory of                    
              classical analysis, i.e. the study of boundary behavior of                     
              analytic functions.
