              knowledge base and application skills in the study of mathematics              
              education.

                     (1)  formal independent study at the University of Maryland;            
                     (2)  research demonstration projects with a master teacher and          
                          mathematician on selected problem-solving strategies used          
                          in the classroom to promote the mathematical understanding         
                          of students; and
