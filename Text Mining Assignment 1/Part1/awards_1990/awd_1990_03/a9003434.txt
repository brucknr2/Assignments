Abstract    :
              This research is to: (a) study the problem of current surges in GaAs and       
              ECL circuits to better understand their impacts on chip reliability, (b)       
              develop automated techniques to analyze power, ground and clock                
              distribution systems in order to detect potential reliability problems,        
              (c) find design rules required for enduring reliability, and (d)               
              incorporate design rules and guidelines into tools for design of high          
              performance circuits.  Transmission line models for interconnects in           
              IC's are being explored.  Analysis methods based on numerical techniques       
              coupled with transmission line theory are being developed.  Optimization       
              techniques are being devised for solving problems of effective                 
              utilization of chip area.  The study of current surges is being                
              approached using experimental, stochastic and analytic techniques.
