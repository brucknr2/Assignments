Abstract    :
                   The goal of this fellowship will be to advance knowledge of               
              the ecological role of Neotropical Chrysomelidae through field                 
              studies concentrating on identifying hostplants and on larval                  
              studies.  This research will be performed in Guanacaste National               
              Park, Costa Rica, because it has a rich and easily accessible                  
              fauna and because Costa Rica is an international center for the                
              study of tropical biodiversity.  The research will be done in                  
              cooperation with local scientists at the Costa rican National                  
              Institute of Biodiversity and made available through the                       
              Institute to the international scientific community and to Costa               
              Rican institutions.                                                            
                   The Chrysomelidae are the second largest family of beetles                
              and are particularly diverse in the American tropics.  Almost all              
              are plant feeders and many are crop pests.   Their role in wild                
              tropical ecosystems is largely unstudied and hostplant and life                
              history information is available for only a small minority of                  
              Neotropical species.  By concentrating field work at Guanacaste                
              National Park, the PI will be able to take advantage of a large                
              body of accumulated botanical and ecological knowledge of the                  
              Park; at the same time,the diversity of habitats in the park                   
              will make findings from this project relevant to many other areas              
              of Central America.
