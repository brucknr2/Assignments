Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project addresses the lessons learned                                     
              from the 17 October 1989 Northern California                                   
              (Loma Prieta) Earthquake.                                                      
                                                                                             
              The objective is to evaluate the state-of-                                     
              the-art analytical techniques for analyzing                                    
              soil-pile foundation-structure interaction                                     
              during earthquake shaking, in order to                                         
              improve the understanding of this phenomenon,                                  
              and to verify and calibrate existing                                           
              techniques.  This is achieved by analyzing                                     
              the response of a 30 story building in                                         
              Emeryville, California, using various                                          
              techniques for analyzing soil-pile-structure                                   
              interaction under seismic loading.                                             
                                                                                             
              The building is a ductile moment resisting                                     
              space frame and wall structure supported by a                                  
              5 foot thick concrete mat with 900 14 by 14                                    
              inch concrete piles.  It is instrumented with                                  
              strong motion recording instruments which                                      
              successfully recorded the building motions                                     
              during the Loma Prieta earthquake (USGS                                        
              Rep.89-568, 1989): the ground motions                                          
              adjacent to the building were also recorded.                                   
                                                                                             
              This investigation involves a collaboration                                    
              with the United States Geological Survey
