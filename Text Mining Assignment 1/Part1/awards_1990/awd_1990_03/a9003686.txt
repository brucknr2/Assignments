Abstract    :
              Bioluminescence is a highly diversified phenomenon involving a                 
              large energy change.  The ultimate goal of this project is the                 
              complete biochemical understanding of bioluminescence and its                  
              roles in living organisms.  To achieve this goal, it is essential              
              to determine the chemical structures of key substances involved                
              in various bioluminescence systems.  Main aims in the next five                
              years are as follows.                                                          
                   (1) Fungal bioluminescence: Preliminary studies suggested                 
              that light is emitted when fugal luciferin reacts with 02-                     
              (superoxide anion) and 02 in the presence of a surfactant-like                 
              substance.  The structure of the luciferin will be determined,                 
              and the mechanism of light-emitting reaction will be investigated              
              from various angles.  The luciferin might be useful as a 02                    
              indicator.                                                                     
                   (2)  Bioluminescence of euphausiids and dinoflagellates:                  
              Tetrapyrroles play key roles in both bioluminescence systems, but              
              in different manners.  In the euphausiid system, the fluorescent               
              substance F (a tetrapyrrole) catalyzes the aerobic oxidation of a              
              photoprotein.  In the dinoflagellate system, luciferin (a                      
              tetrapyrrole) is oxidized into oxyluciferin in the presence of a               
              luciferase.  Despite the apparent difference, both systems may                 
              involve the same basic chemistry  The reactions involved will be               
              investigated to clarify the mechanisms of light emission.  The                 
              oxidizable group of the euphausiid photoprotein will be                        
              determined.
