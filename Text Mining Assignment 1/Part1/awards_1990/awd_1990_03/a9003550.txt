Abstract    :
                   This award will support research in the geometry of Banach                
              spaces.  In finite dimensions, all vector spaces are essentially               
              the same.  But in the infinite dimensional situation of interest               
              here, this is far from the case.  Banach spaces are infinite                   
              dimensional spaces with the additional structure introduced by                 
              varying notions of distance between points in the space.  Such                 
              spaces have wide application in mathematics, both pure and                     
              applied.                                                                       
                   The particular problems which Professors Johnson and Pisier               
              will address include the Lipschitz theory of finite metric                     
              spaces, operator theory and the factorization of operators, weak               
              Hilbert spaces, probability theory, factorization of operator                  
              valued analytic functions, and completely bounded maps.
