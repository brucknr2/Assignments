Abstract    :
                   This project addresses the problem of determining the best way            
              to map the larger-alphabet Reed-Solomon codes into binary codes,               
              thus generating binary codes with important algebraic properties.              
              Vector expansions with various bases will be evaluated, especially             
              those which produce self-orthogonal binary codes. The burst-error              
              correcting capabilities of the codes and complexity of decoders                
              will be examined.
