Abstract    :
                   Investigations will continue into the use of formal methods for           
              developing concurrent and distributed programs, particularly programs          
              that must exhibit fault-tolerance and satisfy real-time constraints.           
              The research will concentrate on assertional methods.  These methods           
              allow a program to be understood in terms of a small number of static          
              relations based on its text, rather than in terms of possible                  
              executions.
