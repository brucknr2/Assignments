Abstract    :
                   This project will support research in the area of nonlinear               
              dispersive systems, in particular, the nonlinear Schrodinger                   
              equation and the Zakharov equation.  The research will be focused              
              in four areas:  (1) nonlinear scattering and stability, (2)                    
              singularity formation and nucleation for the nonlinear                         
              Schrodinger equation and Zakharov systems, (3) dispersion of low               
              energy solutions of equations arising in the mathematical                      
              description of the propagation of long waves, and (4) parametric               
              resonance in Hamiltonian systems and the effect of dissipation.                
                   Nonlinear wave phenomena arise in physical systems ranging                
              from the quantum level to the large scale motion of fluids in                  
              oceans.  Problems in nonlinear waves can be studied using various              
              techniques: analytical, formal asymptotics, and computer                       
              simulations.
