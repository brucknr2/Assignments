Abstract    :
              The major long-term objectives of the research of this laboratory              
              are to define the chromosome of Staphylococcus aureus, and thus                
              gain a better understanding of the factors that are responsible for            
              pathogenicity, the manner by which extrachromosomal elements                   
              contribute to it's characteristics, and to evaluate the degree of              
              diversity that exists within the genus Staphylococcus.  The                    
              specific aims of this proposed research are to (1) continue with               
              the characterization of the chromosome map of NCTC 8325 (phage                 
              group III) S. aureus, (2) continue to characterize the chromosome              
              maps of strains 112 (phage group I) and Ps55 (phage group II), and             
              their relationship to the NCTC 8325 map, (3) develop and evaluate              
              potentially useful mutations that should expand the spectrum of                
              useful approaches and flexibility of genetic analysis in S. aureus,            
              (4) analyze the S. aureus chromosome for the presence of tandem                
              genetic duplications from the perspective of using them as an aid              
              in chromosome mapping, and (5) initiate the development of the                 
              necessary mapping techniques to develop genetic/physical chromosome            
              maps of representative coagulase-negative staphylococci.//
