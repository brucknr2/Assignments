Abstract    :
                   Statistical research on problems in semiparametric inference              
              will be conducted with most relating to survival analysis and                  
              several with a sequential nature. Sequential tests will be                     
              constructed for the relative-scale parameter based on survival                 
              analysis data with censoring in a two-sample accelerated-life                  
              model. The model is semiparametric in that the relative scale                  
              parameter is a parametric component while the baseline                         
              distribution is a nonparametric component. Sequential effective                
              score tests will be developed for this problem as an alternative               
              to sequential logrank tests. More general versions of this will                
              also be analyzed. Estimation will also be studied in accelerated-              
              life models with censored data. The settings will include the                  
              study of elapsed time in sequential clinical trials on survival                
              data, inference for bivariate models induced by frailties,                     
              inference for proportional-mean-residual-life models, weighted U-              
              statistics in semiparametric models, large-sample "completeness",              
              and sequential stopping rules for Monte Carlo tests.
