Abstract    :
                   This project is concerned with problems in cohomology and                 
              the representation theory of finite groups. The principal                      
              investigator will study Mackey functors, with particular                       
              applications to modular representation theory of finite groups                 
              and topology; perfect isometries of blocks and derived                         
              equivalences; and group actions on complexes. The cohomology of                
              groups, with emphasis on compact Lie groups and groups of finite               
              virtual cohomological dimension, will also be examined.                        
                   The research supported concerns the representation of finite              
              groups. The structure of the groups is realized through the                    
              action of the groups as transformations on spaces. This is                     
              currently a very active area of pure algebra.
