Abstract    :
                   Isbell will continue his study of a reinterpretation of                   
              descriptive set theory, the natural interpretation in metrizable               
              locales.  This shift has already been shown to produce at least                
              one gain in metrizable spaces (the standard setting) although                  
              there are three or four losses.  The completed work is almost all              
              in Borel multiplicative class 1.  Most of the main problems now                
              visible are in multiplicative class 2 (F-sigma-delta).  Hopeful                
              indications that the technical losses by the central                           
              reinterpretation may be outweighed by conceptual enrichment are                
              to be explored.  The goal is to shed light on standard                         
              descriptive set theory by demonstrating the existence of an                    
              alternative.
