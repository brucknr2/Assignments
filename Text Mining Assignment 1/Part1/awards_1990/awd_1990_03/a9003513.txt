Abstract    :
              This program will address novel neural network                                 
              models,for distributed stochastic operations.                                  
              Distributed stochastic operations arise in a number                            
              of interesting systems, such as: (1) Multisensor target                        
              tracking, (2) Distributed and hierarchical decision                            
              making in organization structures, (3) Distributed and                         
              cooperative computer data processing, and (4) Global                           
              forecasting of economy factors in complex distributed                          
              systems.  The neural network modeling of such                                  
              systems is highly important, since it can dictate                              
              appropriate operations to be executed and important                            
              factors to be extracted and communicated, for                                  
              effective system operation with simultaneously                                 
              reduced complexity.  Such modeling may also assist in                          
              the understanding of the basic elementary features                             
              and processes in complex systems as the above.                                 
                                                                                             
              The P.I. considers neural network structures whose                             
              objective is either hypothesis testing or parameter                            
              estimation.  She will test specific approaches for the                         
              design and analysis of such networks, with                                     
              performance criteria matching to the environment the                           
              network operates in and its objectives.                                        
                                                                                             
              The P.I. will also investigate new adaptive network                            
              training algorithms, with superior robustness and                              
              convergence characteristics.  These algorithms                                 
              outperform far the popular Least Mean Squares                                  
              (LMS) algorithm, using error criteria that are more                            
              relevant than the minimum mean square error for the                            
              classification of patterns.
