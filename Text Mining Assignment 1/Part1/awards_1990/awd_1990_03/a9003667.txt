Abstract    :
              This project is in the area of Analytical and Surface Chemistry                
              and in the subfields of solvent extraction and solution                        
              equilibria.  Professor Freiser will study the role of the                      
              interface and the molecular structure of the species of                        
              interest in solvent extraction processes.                                      
              This research will use spectroscopic probes to elucidate the                   
              kinetics and thermodynamics of solvent extraction processes                    
              that are facilitated by chelation reactions.  The particular                   
              structural features of these metal chelates will be correlated                 
              with both the kinetics and thermodynamics as well.  The results                
              obtained from this project will be useful in modeling and                      
              understanding liquid partition chromatography, micellar                        
              chromatography, liquid membrane ion selective electrodes and                   
              biomembranes.
