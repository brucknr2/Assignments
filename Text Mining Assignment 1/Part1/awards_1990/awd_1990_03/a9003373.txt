Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will develop specific                          
              probability models for testing, evaluating and applying                        
              classifications.  Classification is the method of constructing                 
              classes of similar objects.  The established models for this                   
              purpose are mixture models, modal models, and for evolutionary                 
              classification, generalized Markov models.  The investigator                   
              introduces a new class of probability models, product partition                
              models, that have wide application in classification, both for                 
              evaluating and selecting classifications, and for using                        
              classifications in prediction.  He also considers more                         
              specialized probability models for devising significance tests                 
              for the existence of clusters, and for reconstructing                          
              evolutionary trees.
