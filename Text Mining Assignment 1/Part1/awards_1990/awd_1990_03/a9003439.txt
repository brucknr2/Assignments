Abstract    :
              The skills and techniques required by modern comparative                       
              physiologists are becoming heavily dependent upon the analytical               
              tools of molecular biology and recombinant DNA technology.  The                
              Mount Desert Island Biological Laboratory (MDIBL) is requesting                
              instrumentation funds for a Molecular Biology/Cell                             
              Biology/Biochemistry Core Facility, including an autoclave, cold               
              cabinet, environmental chamber (Cold room), Beckman                            
              ultracentrifuge (plus rotors), bioguard hood, Cetus thermocycler,              
              electroporation apparatus, high-voltage power supply, MP-4 camera              
              system, liquid N2 vapor tank, transilluminators, vacuum oven and               
              shaking water bath.  The MDIBL is a consortium of 40-50                        
              investigative teams, representing numerous academic institutions               
              nationally, and using marine animal species as models for                      
              transport; acid-base balance, volume regulation; endocrinology                 
              and reproductive physiology; neurophysiology; cardiac                          
              electrophysiology; gametogenesis and development).
