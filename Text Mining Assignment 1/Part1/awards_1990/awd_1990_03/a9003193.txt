Abstract    :
              The broad objective is to understand how organims can manipulate               
              their DNA.  The model system is hypotrichous ciliated protozoa,                
              which manipulate their DNA extensively during development of the               
              macronucleus from a micronucleus after cell mating.  During                    
              macornuclear development all genes are excised from the chromosomes            
              and exist in the mature macronucleus as 20,000 different and                   
              separate DNA molecules ranging in size from 400 pairs (bp) to                  
              12,000 bp.  An example of cutting and joining of DNA is the                    
              chromosomal actin gene, which contains nine exons in the order 1-              
              2-4-5-6-7-8-9 separated by eight intronlike sequences.  The                    
              intronlike sequences are eliminated and the nine exons are                     
              rearranged and joined in the order 8-7-1-2-4-3-5-9-6.  Reordering              
              and removal of intronlike sequences is necessary to yield a                    
              functional actin gene.  The specific aims are: (1) to identify                 
              other genes in which removal of intronlike sequences is accompanied            
              by reordering of exons; (2) to track the temporal order of steps               
              in removal of intronlike sequences and joining of exons in the                 
              micronuclear acting gene, followed by telomere addition, during                
              maconuclear development using primarily the polymerase chain                   
              reaction (PCR) technique.
