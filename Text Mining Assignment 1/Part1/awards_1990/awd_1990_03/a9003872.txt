Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This research deals with computer simulations designed to                 
              elucidate the nature of the dynamics in isolated polymer                       
              solutions and polymer melts.  The grant is a continuation of work              
              previously carried out by the principal investigator at                        
              Washington University.
