              The Loma Prieta earthquake of October 17,                                      
              1989, had a Richter magnitude of 7.1 and                                       
              caused billions of dollars in damage                                           
              throughout the San Francisco Bay region and in                                 
              Santa Cruz County.  As part of the National                                    
              Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program (NEHRP)                                    
              various Federal, state and regional programs                                   
              have been carried out in past years to promote                                 
              the implementation of local-level earthquake                                   
              preparedness and loss reduction activities.                                    
              The Loma Prieta earthquake provides the                                        
              opportunity to examine the specific lessons                                    
              local agency staff have learned through having                                 
              their preparedness plans and loss reduction                                    
              programs tested by a major earthquake in the                                   
              region.  Agency staff selected from                                            
              approximately 35 jurisdictions in seven Bay                                    
              region counties will be asked whether their                                    
              mitigation efforts were effective or were                                      
              likely to be effective in future earthquakes,                                  
              whether the earthquake has caused them to                                      
              change their pre-quake programs and plans, and                                 
              what information sources and program guidance                                  
              they now think are the most useful.  The                                       
              implications of the findings for setting                                       
              local-level priorities for mitigation                                          
              activities, and for the design of Federal,                                     
              state and regional programs to foster local                                    
              level hazard mitigation activities are                                         
              addressed.
