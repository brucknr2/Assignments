Abstract    :
              Dr. I. Y. Chan is supported by a grant from the Experimental                   
              Physical Chemistry Program to study electron signals from                      
              matter under very high pressure. These measurements provide                    
              valuable insight into the properties of electrons in molecules,                
              generally, and the ability of electrons to dictate the                         
              structural and dynamic properties of molecules in solids,                      
              specifically.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              This research involves three areas of activity: (1) the                        
              extension of the high pressure spin-echo technique to                          
              conventional microwave detection. This will greatly increase                   
              the utility of magnetic resonance under pressure; (2)                          
              investigation of pressure effects on the molecular properties                  
              of organic triplets, such as photophysical processes and                       
              charge-transfer interactions; (3) pressure will be employed as                 
              a new dimension in elucidating dynamical processes in molecular                
              crystals such as tunneling, spin-diffusion, libration and                      
              exiton transport.
