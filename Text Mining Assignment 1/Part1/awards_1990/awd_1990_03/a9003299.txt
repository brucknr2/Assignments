Abstract    :
              The goal of this program is the development of a theoretical                   
              foundation for research in parallel computation and computational              
              geometry.  Specifically the following areas will be studied.                   
                                                                                             
                (1) Geometric constructions in parallel                                      
                                                                                             
                (2) Parallel data structuring techniques                                     
                                                                                             
                (3) Geometric problems from graphics and solid modeling                      
                                                                                             
              In addition, many of the algorithms will be implemented on existing            
              hardware to experimentally benchmark the overhead inherent in these            
              algorithms.
