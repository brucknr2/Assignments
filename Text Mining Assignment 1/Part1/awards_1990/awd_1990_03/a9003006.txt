Abstract    :
                   One important theoretical area in the field of network                    
              management and control is the management of protocols.  The                    
              principal investigator of this research will consider prevention,              
              diagnosis, and correction of protocol faults and inefficiencies,               
              from a network management perspective.  In the context of this                 
              research, the concept of "protocol" refers to any system hardware              
              and software that can be modelled by communication finite state                
              machines.                                                                      
                   The research will address three problems:                                 
              1.   the distributed diagnosis of protocol faults in distributed               
                   systems,                                                                  
              2.   the synthesis of protocols whose performance can be                       
                   controlled, and                                                           
              3    the generation of test cases for input output testing of                  
                   protocols for verification and certification.                             
                   The work builds on classical results of protocol analysis                 
              and synthesis, but seeks new formulations and solutions within                 
              the framework of network management.
