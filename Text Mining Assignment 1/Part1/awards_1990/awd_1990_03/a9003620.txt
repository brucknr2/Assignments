Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project focuses on lessons that can be                                    
              learned from the October 17, 1989 Loma Prieta                                  
              Earthquake.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              The study has two broad goals.  First, using                                   
              a variety of methodological approaches, to                                     
              determine the impacts (both real and                                           
              perceived) of the earthquake on low income,                                    
              homeless and non-English speaking people.                                      
              Second, the study will examine the                                             
              organizational responses of public agencies                                    
              (relief and social service agencies, city                                      
              departments, etc.) whose task it is to serve                                   
              these clients.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              Data will be collected using random sampling                                   
              and snowball sampling techniques and will                                      
              consist of semi-structured interviews with                                     
              effected persons and with staff of public                                      
              agencies whose task it is to serve these                                       
              individuals.
