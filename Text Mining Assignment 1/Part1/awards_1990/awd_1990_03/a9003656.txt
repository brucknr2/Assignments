Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project addresses the lessons learned                                     
              from the 17 October 1989 Northern California                                   
              (Loma Prieta) earthquake.  It is a                                             
              continuation of the work that was funded                                       
              through the Small Grant for Exploratory                                        
              Research (SGER) program: the objective of                                      
              that award was to collect perishable data on                                   
              the liquefaction sand boils and the                                            
              superficial ground displacements in the                                        
              Marina District of San Francisco resulting                                     
              from the Loma Prieta earthquake.                                               
                                                                                             
              The objectives of this continuation research                                   
              project are: to supplement the data collected                                  
              with existing data on the Marina District; to                                  
              complement the field observations with in-                                     
              situ and laboratory tests; to compile and                                      
              document a complete data set for case study                                    
              analysis of liquefaction and site                                              
              amplification; to evaluate, using this data                                    
              set, the one-dimensional methods of site                                       
              amplification and liquefaction; and to                                         
              develop a nonlinear finite element model to                                    
              analyze the site amplification and                                             
              liquefaction of the Marina District during                                     
              the Loma Prieta earthquake.                                                    
                                                                                             
              The resulting improved understanding of the                                    
              present methods of liquefaction analysis will                                  
              have application to other areas at risk from                                   
              earthquake-induced liquefaction, such as the                                   
              Los Angeles coast, whose geological                                            
              conditions possess relevant similarities to                                    
              those of the Marina District.
