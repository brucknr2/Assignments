Abstract    :
              This is a post Loma Prieta earthquake (Oct. 1989)                              
              investigation project in learning from this damaging event.                    
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
              The gist of this project is to study the effect of rocking                     
              motion of the earthquake to the structural response.                           
                                                                                             
              The rocking component of ground motion is generally                            
              considered to be small in magnitude and therefore its                          
              effects are neglected.  There are however certain                              
              situations where the combined conditions of structures,                        
              site location, and earthquake motions are such that the                        
              rocking component becomes important.  In this project, the                     
              damage distribution will be studied to determine where the                     
              rocking motion contributed to the damages of the buildings                     
              which were not designed to account for these additional                        
              effects.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              Geology and soil data of the entire bay area will be used                      
              to estimate the rocking motion contributions at various                        
              sites based on the recorded translation motions.  The                          
              generated data will then be used to analyze different                          
              structures for rocking response.                                               
                                                                                             
              This study will enable engineers to determine rationally                       
              the importance of rocking motion in the seismic safety of                      
              structures designed with or without consideration of such                      
              additional earthquake forces.
