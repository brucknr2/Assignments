Abstract    :
                   This research is concerned with the representation theory                 
              of artin algebras. The principal investigator will study                       
              homological and computational questions related to the                         
              representation theory of finite dimensional algebras. He will                  
              continue to investigate the finitistic dimension conjecture                    
              both theoretically and with the aid of computer-generated                      
              examples.                                                                      
                   This project is concerned with the general area of ring                   
              theory. A ring is an algebraic structure having both an                        
              addition and a multiplication. These objects arise naturally                   
              and are important in many areas of mathematics and physics.
