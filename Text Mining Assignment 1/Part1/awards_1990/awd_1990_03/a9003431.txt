Abstract    :
              The request is for computer hardware to permit extension of the                
              work to simple liquid structure and melting in three dimensions.               
              The equipment will allow one to carry out a wide variety of                    
              simulation studies, including realistic molecular-dynamics                     
              simulations of atomic and molecular systems and Monte Carlo                    
              simulations of simple melting models.  He believes that the                    
              results could pave the way for the first true understanding of                 
              melting and liquid structure and of complex melted phases such as              
              molecular liquids, liquid crystals and polymers.
