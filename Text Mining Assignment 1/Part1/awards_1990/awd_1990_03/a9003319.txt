Abstract    :
              This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the work                 
              of Dr. Robert J. McMahon at the University of Wisconsin,                       
              Madison.  The investigation will focus on molecular                            
              rearrangements of reactive molecular species and will result                   
              in an improved understanding of the fundamental processes by                   
              which chemical reactions occur.                                                
                                                                                             
              The experiments that will be carried out by Dr. McMahon will                   
              involve a systematic study of intramolecular hydrogen migration                
              in electron deficient organic intermediates and isolobal,                      
              organometallic analogs.  Low-temperature matrix isolation                      
              techniques will be employed to establish rearrangement pathways                
              and to characterize intermediate species by spectroscopic                      
              methods.  Experiments will be designed to probe the roles of                   
              spin-multiplicity, orientation, distance, and thermodynamic                    
              driving force for the rearrangements.
