Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal requests support for a symposium entitled "Plant                 
              Gametes and Fertilization" sponsored by the Botanical Society of               
              America in conjunction with the American Institute of Biological               
              Sciences Annual Meeting in Richmond, Va., August 7, 1990. The                  
              objective is to stimulate research in the U.S. on plant                        
              reproduction, specifically on the study of gametes and                         
              fertilization in flowering plants, by presenting current research              
              in the field. Emphasis will be on the questions being asked and                
              the experimental approaches used to answer them. Topics will                   
              include isolation and characterization of sperm and eggs,                      
              fertilization in vivo and in vitro and methods used in the study               
              of algal gametes and fertilization. By inviting international                  
              speakers and Americans who have worked abroad, the symposium will              
              provide an overview of this expanding international field.                     
              Invited talks will be followed by an open session of contributed               
              papers on plant gametes and fertilization to which any member may              
              submit an abstract.

              Sexual reproduction in flowering plants has emerged as an area of              
              significant scientific progress in the last five years, in                     
              addition to its obvious importance to agriculture. This meeting                
              will provide access for U.S. scientists to the latest work in                  
              this area.
