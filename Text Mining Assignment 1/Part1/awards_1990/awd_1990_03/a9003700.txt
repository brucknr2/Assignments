Abstract    :
                   The Avalon composite terrane of the northern Appalachian                  
              orogen represent a college of tectonostratigraphic terranes that               
              were amalgamated in the late Precambrian, accreted as a composite              
              terrane to North America during the early-middle Paleozoic, and                
              were subsequently dispersed variable distances relative to each                
              other.  Identification of the constituent terrane elements within              
              the composite terrane has been controversial, their                            
              tectonothermal evolution is uncertain, and the nature and timing               
              of amalgamation, accretion and dispersal are poorly constrained.               
              This project will address these issue through a comprehensive                  
              structural and 40Ar/39Ar geochronological study of a                           
              representative portion of the Avalon composite terrane in                      
              southwestern New Brunswick where recent studies have shown an                  
              important late Precambrain terrane boundary may exist.  Results                
              of a reconnaissance 40Ar//39Ar isotopic survey indicate that a                 
              significant contribution can be made in the proposed study area.               
                   The project couples detailed structural mapping kinematic                 
              analysis and petrological studies with a program of 40Ar/39Ar                  
              mineral dating designed to resolve the region's tectonothermal                 
              evolution.  The study will substantially improve knowledge of the              
              nature, timing and kinematics of tectonothermal events recorded                
              in the Avalon composite terrane and, thereby, will greatly                     
              facilitate the identification and correlation of constituent late              
              Precambrian terranes.
