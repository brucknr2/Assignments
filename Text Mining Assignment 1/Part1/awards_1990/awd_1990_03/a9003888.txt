Abstract    :
              This is a post Loma Prieta earthquake (Oct. 1989)                              
              investigation project in learning from this damaging                           
              event.                                                                         
                                                                                             
              The objectives of the research are to use these records                        
              to:  (1) conduct a comprehensive building performance                          
              study for the time-varying nature of vibration periods                         
              and damping, and (2) estimate the maximum story drift, a                       
              crucial quantity for the assessment of possible building                       
              damage.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              A well established system identification method, improved                      
              in accuracy and efficiency in a related research program                       
              supported by the National Science Foundation, will be                          
              used for the parameter identification in this research.                        
              The identification of the vibration period and damping                         
              will be carried out for about 40 building records.  The                        
              story drift estimation requires the development of a new                       
              method and will be carried out for selected buildings.                         
              The time-varying nature of the building period, damping,                       
              and story drift will be used to assess and calibrate the                       
              building damage state.  The information obtained will                          
              form the basis for a building performance evaluation                           
              procedure.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              Based on the findings of this research, a procedure of                         
              post-earthquake building performance evaluation using                          
              strong motion records will be recommended for future                           
              applications.
