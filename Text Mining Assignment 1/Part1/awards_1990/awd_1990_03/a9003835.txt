Abstract    :
                   Professor Hadwin will conduct research on the theory of                   
              operators on Hilbert space.  His investigation will include work               
              on generalizations of the Bishop-Stone-Weierstrass theorem for                 
              subalgebras of a C* or W* algebra, a study of the notion of                    
              reflexivity for operators and operator algebras, and of invariant              
              operator ranges, among other topics.                                           
                   Hilbert space operators are essentially infinite matrices of              
              complex numbers.  These operators have applications in every area              
              of applied science as well as in pure mathematics.  This type of               
              research is an attempt to classify certain important categories                
              of such objects.
