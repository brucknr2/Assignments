Abstract    :
              Dr. Schepartz proposes to use a new technique - protein affinity               
              cleavage - to analyze the mechanism of protein folding.  The                   
              method requires the synthesis of bifunctional molecules which                  
              contain a protein-cleaving reagent covalently tethered to a                    
              protein-binding ligand.  Once the ligand is bound the hydroxyl                 
              radical is loosed to allow cleavage in the neighborhood of the                 
              active site.  Analysis of the sites of peptide cleavage will help              
              elucidate the active site and surround to a resolution of single               
              amino acids.  It is claimed to be superior in this regard to                   
              other techniques, such as affinity labeling experiments.  The                  
              results from this study promise to provide evidence for this                   
              claim and should give interesting data on the peptidy-prolyl                   
              isomerase enzymes which will be studied.
