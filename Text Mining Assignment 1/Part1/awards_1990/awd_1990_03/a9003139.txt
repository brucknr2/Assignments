Abstract    :
                This project compares the contrasting careers and personal lives of          
              two great 20th Century British women scientists, one a theoretician            
              and the other an experimentalist, and seeks to clarify the social and          
              scientific determinants of success and of failure for women in                 
              science.  The lives and works of these two women intersected in the            
              1930s, when both were based at Oxford, while further belonging to a            
              group of a dozen ideologically sensitive scientists who pioneered the          
              rise of molecular biology in Britain.  The case study of Dorothy C.            
              Hodgkin (1910-), sole recipient of the Nobel Prize for chemistry in            
              1964, will be explored as a paradigm of success, including the                 
              establishment of a research school composed of over a hundred men and          
              women disciples.  The case study of Dorothy Wrinch (1894-1976), a              
              mathematician turned biologist who had been considered a "woman                
              Einstein," but who came to spend the later part of her career obsessed         
              with a theory which her men rivals erroneously claimed to have                 
              refuted, will be explored as a paradigm of failure.  The project seeks         
              to exhibit and clarify the diversity of women's experience in science          
              in its historical, scientific, and political contexts.                         
                The interactive component of this project includes: a) teaching a            
              new course "Social history of women scientists from the French                 
              revolution to the present" for both graduate and undergraduate                 
              students; b) the organization of an interdisciplinary and                      
              international symposium on "Women's lives in science:  Historical and          
              contemporary perspectives," at which historians, sociologists and              
              practicing scientists will present their experiences; c) teaching a            
              new seminar on "Research schools of molecular biology in the US, UK            
              and France, 1920-1970"; d) the organization of a monthly colloquium to         
              stimulate interaction between the scientific, historical and literary          
              communities, especially students, at the host institution.                     
                This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to                
              provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in                    
              engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and (2)         
              to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering by             
              providing greater visibility for women scientists and engineers                
              employed in industry, government, and academic institutions.  By               
              encouraging the participation of women in science, it is a valuable            
              investment in the Nation's future scientific vitality.
