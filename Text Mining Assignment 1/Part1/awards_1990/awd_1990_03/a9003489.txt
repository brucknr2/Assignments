Abstract    :
                   This award provides one-half the funds necessary to                       
              construct a micro-sampling system for the extraction of oxygen                 
              from silicates for isotopic analysis. The system will be attached              
              to a mass spectrometer in the Department of Geosciences at the                 
              Pennsylvania State University. The University will provide the                 
              remaining funds for the project.                                               
                   The micro-sampling system will permit oxygen isotope                      
              analysis of sub-milligram samples and the in situ study of                     
              isotope gradients on the millimeter scale. The improved micro-                 
              sampling system will be applied to the isotopic analysis of                    
              diamonds and other mantle-derived minerals.
