Abstract    :
                   With this award the principal investigators will continue                 
              their mathematical analysis of models of reactive thermal                      
              explosions.  In particular, they will analyze the solutions of                 
              initial-boundary value problems that describe the evolution of                 
              diffusive and nondiffusive thermal explosions in confined domains,             
              in order to determine where and when explosions will take place.               
              With regard to these latter questions the principal investigators              
              will describe precisely how the blowup singularities evolve in                 
              space and time as the blowup time is reached.                                  
                   Natural phenomena involving burning and explosions offer                  
              important scientific and technological areas of investigation.  As             
              with many physical processes there are generally two avenues for               
              study:  the theoretical and the experimental.  This award                      
              represents the theoretical approach to combustion.  In it the                  
              principal investigators will use mathematical analysis to                      
              determine where and when explosions occur in models of thermally               
              reactive systems in containers and the locations of hotspots.
