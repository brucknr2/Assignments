Abstract    :
                   Professor Faris will conduct research in the mathematics of               
              wave propagation in random media.  The spectral and scattering                 
              properties of the waves will be studied.  Faris' major goal is to              
              describe the role of scattering resonances in determining the                  
              scattering properties of a random obstacle.  Another goal is to                
              understand random wave diffusion.                                              
                   The study of random media is of great interest in modern                  
              physics and mathematics.  The idea here is that in certain types               
              of materials the atoms are not arranged in a regular manner.  In               
              fact the materials tend to look rather chaotic.  The mathematical              
              model then is probabilistic, and one tries to find statements                  
              which are true with probability one.
