Abstract    :
              Robotic systems in large-scale environments must carefully manage              
              sensing tasks in order to make sense of the world.  This grant                 
              is for characterization of optimal sensing strategies in computer              
              vision and touch sensing.  Much of the research will focus on                  
              maximizing temporal consistency of incoming data, with special                 
              study of tactile curvature information and active visual                       
              computation of shape from shading.  Algorithms will be tested for              
              tactile recognition of objects and visual mapping of object                    
              structure.
