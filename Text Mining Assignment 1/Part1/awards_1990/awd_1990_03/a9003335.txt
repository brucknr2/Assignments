Abstract    :
                   Professor Douglas plans to continue his research in two                   
              areas: multivariable spectral theory and the study of invariants               
              for differential operators on manifolds with boundary and on                   
              foliated manifolds.  His research in multivariable operator                    
              theory will involve the study of Hilbert modules from the                      
              viewpoint of analytic and algebraic geometry.  The study of                    
              invariants for differential operators will involve the Chern                   
              character for operators on a manifold with boundary.                           
                   This research involves the theory of Hilbert space                        
              operators.  These are essentially infinite matrices of complex                 
              numbers.  Such objects have applications in every area of                      
              applied science as well as in pure mathematics.  This type of                  
              research is an attempt to classify certain important classes of                
              Hilbert space operators.
