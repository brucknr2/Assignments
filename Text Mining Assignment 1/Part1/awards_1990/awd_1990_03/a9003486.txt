Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will develop a series of numerical simulations to                 
              determine the influence of basement topography and an uneven                   
              sedimemt layer on off-axis, hydrothermal circulation through                   
              oceanic seciments and crust in a variety of settings.  The                     
              investigators will cast the general problem in curvilinear                     
              coordinates and use the intergrated finite difference approach to              
              problems of coupled heat and fluid flow.  They will establish the              
              relative importance of bathymetric amplitude and wavelength,                   
              crustal permeability structure, sediment thickness and uniformity,             
              background heat flow, and the presence of discontinuous,                       
              impermeable sediment layers in determining the depth, geometry, and            
              intensity of fluid fluxes away from the ridge axis.
