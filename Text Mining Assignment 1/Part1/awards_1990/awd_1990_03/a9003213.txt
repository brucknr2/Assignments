Abstract    :
                  This project is concerned with the admissible                              
              representation theory of reductive groups over p-adic fields                   
              and, in particular, the various correspondences between the                    
              sets of irreducible representations of these groups. The                       
              principal investigators will work on the classification of the                 
              admissible dual via restriction to certain compact, open                       
              subgroups; relations with parabolic induction; and                             
              compatibility with Langlands functoriality and Howe's theory of                
              the theta correspondence.                                                      
                   This research falls into the broad category of p-adic                     
              algebraic groups. Historically, algebraic groups arose in an                   
              effort to describe all the transformations or symmetries of an                 
              n-dimensional space. The spaces under consideration here,                      
              however, are not the familiar real spaces like the line and the                
              plane, but totally disconnected objects that are important in                  
              number theory and pure algebra.
