Abstract    :
                   This award is for support of the research in arithmetic                   
              algebraic geometry of Dr. Noam Elkies of Harvard University. Dr.               
              Elkies proposes to continue his studies of the arithmetic of                   
              supersingular curves over function fields with finite constant                 
              field; by looking closely at these, he has already discovered                  
              sphere packings in certain high-dimensional Euclidean spaces that              
              are more dense than any previously known. In addition, Dr. Elkies              
              plans to investigate explicit modular equations from a                         
              computational viewpoint and connect these with the abstract                    
              theory of heights.                                                             
                   This is research in the field of arithmetic algebraic                     
              geometry, a subject that combines the techniques of algebraic                  
              geometry and number theory. In its original formulation,                       
              algebraic geometry treated figures that could be defined in the                
              plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials. Number                    
              theory started with the whole numbers and such questions as                    
              divisibility of one whole number by another. These two subjects,               
              seemingly so far apart, have in fact influenced each other from                
              the earliest times, but in the past quarter century the mutual                 
              influence has increased greatly. The field of arithmetic                       
              algebraic geometry now uses techniques from all of modern                      
              mathematics, and is having corresponding influence beyond its own              
              borders.
