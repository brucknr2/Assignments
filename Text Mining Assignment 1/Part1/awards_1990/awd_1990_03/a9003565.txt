Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project addresses the lessons learned                                     
              from the 17 October 1989 Northern California                                   
              (Loma Prieta) earthquake.  It follows a "quick                                 
              response" award made to Dames and Moore for                                    
              the collection of perishable data from the                                     
              earthquake.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              The Loma Prieta earthquake affected the                                        
              performance of virtually every type of                                         
              lifeline in the San Francisco Bay Area,                                        
              including natural gas systems.  Natural gas                                    
              systems were severely affected in areas of                                     
              significant ground failure, such as in the                                     
              Marina district, where several large fires                                     
              erupted after the initial ground shock.  There                                 
              was concern that uncontrolled fires would be                                   
              fueled by gas leaks in the area.  Fortunately,                                 
              the fires were contained by utilizing several                                  
              alternative water sources.                                                     
                                                                                             
              The aim of this project is to study the                                        
              effects of the earthquake on local natural gas                                 
              systems.  Specifically it analyzes the data                                    
              collected as part of the "quick response"                                      
              award, in order to develop better seismic risk                                 
              evaluation models for natural gas systems, and                                 
              to determine whether existing safety devices,                                  
              such as seismic shutoff valves, are a feasible                                 
              solution for mitigating overall earthquake                                     
              losses.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              An analysis of these data builds upon limited                                  
              studies which already exist for these systems.                                 
              A comparison of performance data from this                                     
              event to similar data from the 1971 San                                        
              Fernando and the 1987 Whittier Narrows                                         
              earthquakes is critical in order to quantify                                   
              differences in performance due to regional                                     
              factors and level of earthquake preparedness.
