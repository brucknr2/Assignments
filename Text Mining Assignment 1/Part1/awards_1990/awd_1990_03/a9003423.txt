Abstract    :
              Boolean categories provide a framework for programming language                
              semantics.  In contrast to the syntax-driven style commonly employed           
              in theoretical computer science, there is but one primitive, program-          
              chaining, in terms of which all other constructs must be expressed;            
              extensive work by category theorists in the past four decades has              
              demonstrated the feasibility of this approach.  The abstract theory of         
              Boolean categories and some of its specializations have been developed         
              by the proposer and his close colleagues in the past ten years.  This          
              work has studied fundamental control structures including recursion.           
              Further, all Boolean categories have an intrinsic theory of predicate          
              transformation which provides a high-level specification language of           
              logical assertions.  It is a theorem that this specification language          
              follows the lines of classical nondeterminism.  By contrast, the               
              choice of model is flexible enough to allow the hidden state to be             
              arbitrarily complex, it being possible to represent very general forms         
              of nondeterminism.  The research centers on incorporating fairness and         
              unbounded nondeterminism into the Boolean category framework.
