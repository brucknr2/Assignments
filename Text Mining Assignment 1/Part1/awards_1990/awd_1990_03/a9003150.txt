Abstract    :
              This proposed research program focuses on the relationship                     
              between race, class, and public opinion.  It addresses the issues              
              of black intragroup cohesiveness and black/white differences in                
              general attitudes and values.  The first phase examines the                    
              general attitudes, values, and opinions expressed by black                     
              Americans and the extent to which class cleavages can account for              
              any existing intraracial differences.  The second phase will                   
              explore interracial differences (black/white) focusing on class-               
              based explanations.  Data come from the NSF-supported General                  
              Social Surveys from 1982 and 1987.  The PI will contrast Myrdal's              
              thesis that blacks lack intragroup diversity with Wilson's                     
              contention that emerging class cleavages among blacks and the                  
              increasing social isolation of lower class blacks have spawned                 
              measurable intraracial differences on a variety of attitudes and               
              opinions.
