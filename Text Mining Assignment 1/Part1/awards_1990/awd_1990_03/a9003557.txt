Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project focuses on lessons that can be                                    
              learned following the October 17, 1989 Loma                                    
              Prieta Earthquake.                                                             
                                                                                             
              The objective of the study is to conduct                                       
              research on the cause and effects of fires                                     
              initiated by the Loma Prieta earthquake.                                       
              Specifically the following will be done:                                       
                                                                                             
              o    Compile post-earthquake fire statistics                                   
                   in terms of type (electrical, gas or                                      
                   others) and correlate these statistics                                    
                   with the regional earthquake intensity                                    
                   (acceleration) data of the earthquake.                                    
                                                                                             
              o    Conduct analytic studies to evaluate the                                  
                   chain of events leading to a fire after                                   
                   an earthquake, investigate the cause of                                   
                   fire and establish the probability of                                     
                   fire development in terms of a given                                      
                   earthquake intensity.                                                     
                                                                                             
              o    Use the Loma Prieta data and the analytic                                 
                   studies to develop risk of fires                                          
                   associated with future earthquakes and to                                 
                   investigate the design implementation of                                  
                   the calculated risk for hazard mitigation                                 
                   purposes.
