Abstract    :
                This research on the prairie vole, Microtus ochrogaster, has three           
              objectives:  1) to test the Charnov.Finerty (1980) hypothesis, which           
              proposed that differences in genetic relatedness at high versus low            
              population densities drives vole population cycles: 2) to determine            
              whether the proximate mechanism of this hypothesis is genetic                  
              relatedness per se, or familiarity (as suggested by Bekoff 1981); 3)           
              to determine whether either degree of genetic relatedness or                   
              familiarity influences the mating system under field conditions.  By           
              manipulating matings and housing conditions in the laboratory, four            
              populations of varying degrees of genetic relatedness and familiarity          
              will be created:  Kin-Familiar, Kin-Unfamiliar, Non Kin-Familiar,              
              Non-Kin Unfamiliar.  These populatins will be released into four field         
              enclosures and live-trapped every two weeks.  Wounding (as a measure           
              of aggression), dispersal rates, reproductive condition, population            
              numbers and spacing patterns will be monitored.  DNA fingerprinting            
              will be used to determine reproductive success and mating system               
              in each enclosure.                                                             
                The interactive component consists of teaching a graduate seminar            
              on women animal behaviorists, organizing a discussion group for women          
              students and faculty, organizing a symposium on women and science,             
              and presenting a department seminar.                                           
                This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to                
              provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in                    
              engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and             
              (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering            
              by providing greater visibility for women scientists and engineers             
              employed in industry, government, and academic institutions.  By               
              encouraging the participation of women in science, it is a valuable            
              investment in the Nation's future scientific vitality.
