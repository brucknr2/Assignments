Abstract    :
                   The principal investigators continue studies of nonlinear                 
              partial differential equations.  The present investigations                    
              include symmetry-breaking for solutions of nonlinear wave                      
              equations, solutions of semilinear equations with finite symmetry              
              groups, conformal metrics on the two-dimensional sphere,                       
              radially symmetric solutions of Einstein-Yang-Mills equations,                 
              shock wave problems, and certain problems of topology.                         
                   These mathematical questions capture features of a variety                
              of physical problems.  For instance, questions addressed in                    
              the Einstein-Yang-Mills studies have implications for the                      
              importance of quantum effects in forming black holes.                          
              Many problems in mathematical biology, physics, and geometry                   
              have solutions that show certain patterns or symmetries.                       
              Symmetry-breaking indicates changes in the character of the                    
              solutions as parameters of the problems change.
