Abstract    :
                   The research concerns the topic of multivariate statistical               
              distributions with given marginals. Frechet bounds for the                     
              distribution functions will be improved through the imposition                 
              of additional constraints such as a specific value for the                     
              correlation or the requirement that the joint distributions have               
              symmetry or unimodality. Various orderings and measures for the                
              distributions will be studied and, in particular, alternative                  
              orderings to invariance under strictly increasing marginal                     
              transformations. The suitability of approximations to complicated              
              multivariate distributions by relatively tractable multivariate                
              distributions will be examined. Some of the methods of extending               
              univariate distributions to higher dimensions that will be                     
              studied are independent bases, characterizations, sampling from                
              Bernoulli or Urn models, shock models and mixtures.
