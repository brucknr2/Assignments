Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research in automorphic forms of                  
              Professor Steven Kudla of the University of Maryland at College                
              Park. Dr. Kudla's project is to work on two problems involving                 
              theta functions, L-functions, and arithmetic. The first of these               
              problems concerns a conjecture about the identification of the                 
              first two terms in the Laurent expansion of the Siegel Eisenstein              
              series at certain special points. The second is concerned with an              
              analogue for the triple L-function of the result of Gross and                  
              Zagier that relates the derivative of the standard L-function of               
              a holomorphic cusp form on GL(2) to the height pairing of Heegner              
              points on the Jacobian of the modular curve.                                   
                   Non-Euclidean plane geometry began in the early nineteenth                
              century as a mathematical curiosity, but by the end of that                    
              century, mathematicians had realized that many objects of                      
              fundamental importance are non-Euclidean in their basic nature.                
              The detailed study of non-Euclidean plane geometries has given                 
              rise to several branches of modern mathematics, of which the                   
              study of modular and automorphic forms is one of the most active.              
              This field is principally concerned with questions about the                   
              whole numbers, but in its use of geometry and analysis, it                     
              retains connection to its historical roots.
