Abstract    :
              This project will study three dimensional deformation fields in the            
              vicinity of stationary and growing cracks.  A project with both                
              analytical and experimental components will be conducted.  Finite              
              element methods will also be used to asses the role of thickness               
              on near tip deformation fields.
