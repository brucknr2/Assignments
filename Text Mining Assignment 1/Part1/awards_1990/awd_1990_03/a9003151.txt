Abstract    :
              This research program involves the study of glasses, primarily                 
              through the use of nuclear magnetic resonance.  The proposed                   
              research is in several different areas.  One area is a                         
              collaboration (S.W. Martin, Iowa State) on 29Si magic angle                    
              sample spinning NMR on alkali borosilicate glasses over an                     
              extremely wide range of compositions.  A second area is an                     
              continuation of studies with P. Bray (Brown) on the 10B and 11B                
              nuclear quadrupole resonance properties of alkali borate glasses.              
              Further studies will also be made of extremely high alkali                     
              content alkali borate glasses with the emphasis on exploring the               
              relationship between structure and physical properties.  A new                 
              collaboration with Kamitsos (National Hellenic Research                        
              Foundation, Athens) on joint infrared and Raman spectroscopic                  
              studies of very high alkali contnet borate glasses will be                     
              initiated.
