Abstract    :
              This is a post Loma Prieta earthquake (Oct. 1989)                              
              investigation project in learning from this damaging                           
              event.                                                                         
                                                                                             
              The thrust of this project is to study the earthquake                          
              effect on masonry and masonry veneer buildings based on                        
              analysis and damage observations.                                              
                                                                                             
              The overall objective of this project is to improve the                        
              seismic safety of masonry and masonry veneer buildings in                      
              the United States.  Its specific objective is to evaluate                      
              the seismic performance of masonry and masonry veneer                          
              buildings in the October 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, with                     
                                                                                             
              particular attention to the behavior of selected                               
              buildings.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              The following task will be undertaken:  l) review                              
              the overall behavior of masonry and masonry                                    
              veneer buildings; 2) select a small number (3-5) of                            
              such buildings for further study, based on their                               
              usefulness as prototypes, and on the availability of                           
              strong-motion records, 3) study their damages in detail,                       
              and compare their responses with that predicted                                
              analytically; and 4) using this comparison, assess the                         
              effectiveness of existing masonry design codes, estimate                       
              the probable hazard of existing masonry buildings, and                         
              provide useful information to those concerned with the                         
              repair and retrofit of masonry buildings.                                      
                                                                                             
              This study will lead to an improved understanding of the                       
              seismic damage to masonry and masonry veneer buildings and                     
                                                                                             
              the development of practical ways to mitigate such future                      
              damage to such existing buildings in seismic hazard areas.
