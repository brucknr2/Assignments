Abstract    :
              Experimental and theoretical investigations of possible                        
              mechanisms of  backflow of information in neurons are                          
              proposed.  Such retrograde flow of information is a                            
              crucial aspect of learning and plasticity of neural                            
              networks involving backpropagation.  The experimental                          
              preparations to be used are hippocampal slices of the rat                      
              brain.  Evidence of retrograde pathways of informational                       
              flow other than membrane electrical potentials will be                         
              sought.  One stimulus will be mechanical compression of                        
              efferent axons or axon hillocks.  Changes in synaptic                          
              response at the dendritic and axonal levels will be                            
              monitored as evidence of backpropagation.  The time                            
              scale of interest will be milliseconds as opposed to slower                    
              processes of axonal cytoplasmic flow in either direction.                      
              If functional plasticity is demonstrated, electron-                            
              microscopic examination of synapses will be made to seek                       
              cytoskeletal or vesicle alterations that correlate with the                    
              functional changes.  Theoretical models will consist of                        
              cytoskeletal components of actin-myosin gel, microtubular                      
              structure and a  viscoelastic matrix representing                              
              cytoplasm.  An active tension will be assumed in the                           
              actin-myosin gel.  Possible modes of wave propagation in                       
              the composite structure will be investigated.  The                             
              significance of the proposed research will be very                             
              important of correlation of biological counterparts to                         
              theoretical models of neural networks.
