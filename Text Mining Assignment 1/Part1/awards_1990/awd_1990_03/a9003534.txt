Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              On the wake of Hurricane Hugo two issues will                                  
              be examined in this study: the effect that                                     
              shelter near or around buildings has on the                                    
              survivability of the structures; and the                                       
              degree of wind engineering knowledge being                                     
              applied to reconstruction.  A survey of                                        
              damaged and destroyed buildings in South                                       
              Carolina and of the reconstruction process                                     
              will be conducted and recorded, and a                                          
              preliminary analysis will be carried out that                                  
              will be of great benefit to the wind                                           
              engineering community.
