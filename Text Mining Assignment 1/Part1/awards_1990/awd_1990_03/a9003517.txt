Abstract    :
              This award will provide support for travel by students and young               
              faculty to the 1990 Sensor and Actuator Workshop to be held in Hilton          
              Head, SC.  This is one of two key workshops for this area of research,         
              and it is important that students and faculty have the opportunity to          
              attend.  The PI will convene a panel of senior individuals to review           
              applications for support, and awards will be made with the following           
              priority:  (1) graduate students who are presenting papers, (2)                
              researchers less than five years from the PhD who are presenting               
              papers, and (3) other researchers having a proven record of                    
              productivity in the area and who can justify a genuine need for travel         
              assistance.
