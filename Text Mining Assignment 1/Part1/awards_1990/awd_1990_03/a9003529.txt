Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research program is part of the                                           
              initiative to collect perishable data                                          
              resulting from the 17 October 1989 Northern                                    
              California (Loma Prieta) earthquake.                                           
                                                                                             
              It was observed that the specific                                              
              geotechnical conditions at a site and the                                      
              thickness of the soft soil deposits had a                                      
              significant influence on the distribution of                                   
              damage and apparent intensity of shaking                                       
              during the earthquake.  Immediately following                                  
              the earthquake, the U.S. Geological Survey                                     
              (USGS) undertook the installation, in the                                      
              most severely damaged areas of San Francisco                                   
              and Oakland, of strong motion instruments on                                   
              the ground surface and in deep boreholes on                                    
              top of bedrock.  Undisturbed soil samples                                      
              were recovered from all the significant                                        
              geologic units within the soil profile during                                  
              the drilling operations.  These samples                                        
              contain information that can be used to                                        
              perform full dynamic site response analyses                                    
              for both post-mortem investigations of the                                     
              site response, and for prediction of the                                       
              future response to strong ground shaking.                                      
                                                                                             
              The objective of this study is to obtain this                                  
              information through appropriate                                                
              classification tests and dynamic response                                      
              tests performed on these soil samples, and to                                  
              combine this information with in-situ shear                                    
              wave velocity measurements obtained by the                                     
              USGS: this will result in a full description                                   
              of the dynamic response characteristics of                                     
              the soil deposit.                                                              
                                                                                             
              The results are to be presented as a report                                    
              containing the complete stress-strain data as                                  
              well as the derived modulus and damping ratio                                  
              as a function of strain.
