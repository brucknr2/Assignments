Abstract    :
                   The principal investigators will be working on topics in                  
              statistics and probability.  The first investigator, Dr.                       
              Bhattacharya, will continue his work on asymptotic expansions and              
              on large time stability in certain important classes of                        
              nonlinear stochastic systems.  Asymptotic expansions is a field                
              central to statistics, and the investigator will consider                      
              refinements of the Gaussian approximation in central limit                     
              theorem motivated by applications, e.g. in analyzing bootstrap                 
              methodology.  The second topic lies between dynamical systems at               
              one end and nonsingular or irreducible Markov processes at the                 
              other.  The second investigator, Dr. Chan, will work on problems               
              related to statistical inference for nonstationary time series                 
              with infinite variance.  This study is motivated by economics,                 
              finance, and communications engineering.
