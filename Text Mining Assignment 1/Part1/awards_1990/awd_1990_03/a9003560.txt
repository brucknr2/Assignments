Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project addresses lessons that can be                                     
              learned from the October 17, 1989 Loma Prieta                                  
              Earthquake.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              In most natural disasters, there is                                            
              significant direct impact on human                                             
              populations:  specifically injuries and death                                  
              result from the hazard itself, or as a result                                  
              of the particular hazard's effect on the                                       
              infrastructure.  While advances in engineering                                 
              have certainly lessened this impact over the                                   
              past several decades, there are still many                                     
              unanswered questions as to the precise cause                                   
              and severity of injuries occurring during                                      
              natural disasters.  By applying techniques                                     
              developed in the relatively new field of                                       
              earthquake injury epidemiology, the research                                   
              described in this proposal will enable a                                       
              detailed epidemiologic study to be made of the                                 
              injuries resulting from the 1989 Loma Prieta                                   
              earthquake in the County of Santa Cruz.                                        
              Preliminary quick-response field                                               
              reconnaissance - already performed - coupled                                   
              with comprehensive follow-up data collection                                   
              and interviews will enable a detailed                                          
              accounting of all the injuries in the County                                   
              resulting from the earthquake.  This                                           
              information will be of significant use for                                     
              earthquake preparedness and hazard mitigation                                  
              activities.  In addition, collection of the                                    
              data will enable the testing of the research                                   
              methodology for application in future events.
