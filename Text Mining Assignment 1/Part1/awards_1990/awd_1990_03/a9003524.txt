Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The principal investigator will conduct research into                     
              Riemannian manifolds with positive Ricci curvature and harmonic                
              maps between spheres.  He will investigate as to whether products              
              of two closed 1-connected manifolds must have positive Ricci                   
              curvature when each has such curvature.  And he will investigate               
              the problem of whether closed 1-connected 5-manifolds carry                    
              metrics with positive Ricci curvature.                                         
                   The study of differential geometry has focused on problems                
              concerning curvature for over a century.  Today there are several              
              competing notions of curvature including sectional, Gauss, and                 
              Ricci.  Recently, in collaboration, the principal investigator                 
              constructed a complete Riemannian manifold with positive Ricci                 
              curvature which did not have non-negative sectional curvature.                 
              In this project he will study related questions for hypersurfaces              
              of dimension four and five.
