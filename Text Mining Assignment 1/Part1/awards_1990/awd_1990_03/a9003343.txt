Abstract    :
                   Professor Packer will study two topics under the general                  
              heading of twisted crossed product C* algebras: (i) the                        
              topological structure of the primitive ideal space of twisted                  
              group C* algebras related to nilpotent groups, and (ii) K-                     
              theoretic invariants for certain twisted crossed product C*                    
              algebras.                                                                      
                   The notion of a C* algebra is an abstraction of the idea of               
              a family of linear transformations on a space.  These                          
              transformations can also be thought of as having values in the                 
              states of the space, and the property of this family which is                  
              responsible for the symbol * is that the algebra is generated by               
              transformations whose values in these states are real numbers.                 
              The fact that these objects appear naturally in many branches of               
              mathematics and physics make them important to study.
