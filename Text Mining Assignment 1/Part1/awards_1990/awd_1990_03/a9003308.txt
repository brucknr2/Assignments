Abstract    :
              This grant is in the general field of analytical and surface                   
              chemistry and in the subfield of spectroscopy of liquid solid                  
              interfaces.  Professor Marc Porter of Iowa State University                    
              will use monomolecular films at solid surfaces to develop                      
              structure-property and structure-reactivity relationships                      
              relevent to surface chemical reactions.  The use of                            
              electrochemically active functional groups specifically                        
              synthesized at the liquid-solid interface will allow the study                 
              of surface pH gradients.  Optical spectroscopic methods will be                
              used to probe the self assembled thiophenyl linkages at                        
              platinum and gold electrode surfaces.                                          
                                                                                             
              Surface infrared, spectroelectrochemistry and surface enhanced                 
              Raman spectroscopy will be used to study the reactivity and                    
              transformation of functional groups at the monolayer interface.                
              Probe molecules will be used to determine Hammett linear free                  
              energy relationships.  Spatially oriented arrays of pendant                    
              reactive functional groups (carboxylic acids, amines, esters                   
              and quinones) will be constructed and the effects of packing                   
              density, orientation and composition on reactivity will be                     
              explored.   Electrochemical parameters will also be explored as                
              a means to control reactivity and structure.
