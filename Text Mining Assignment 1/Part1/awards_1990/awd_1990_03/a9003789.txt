Abstract    :
              This is a post Loma Prieta earthquake (Oct. 1989)                              
              investigation project in learning from this damaging                           
              event.                                                                         
                                                                                             
              This project is directed toward the evaluation of the                          
              performance, including interpretation and analysis of                          
              earthquake-response records, of the well-instrumented six                      
              earth dams which were shaken by the Loma Prieta,                               
              California earthquake (M=7.1) of October 17, 1989.                             
                                                                                             
              The shaking during the main and after shocks triggered                         
              most of the accelerographs on the six dams (one of them                        
              is partially damaged) providing the most extensive array                       
              of earthquake response measurements yet obtained in the                        
              U.S. and abroad.  The data obtained will be used to (1)                        
              study the effects of sequential earthquakes on the safety                      
              of earth dams, (2) correlate dynamic properties (shear                         
              modulus and damping) extracted from field performance                          
              during earthquakes, via system identification techniques,                      
              with existing laboratory-measured properties of the dam                        
              materials, (3) verify the adequacy of existing procedures                      
              for seismic analysis of earth dams by applying them to                         
              observational data and by comparing predicted results                          
              with measured responses, (4) disseminate research                              
              findings, and (5) document and improve capability to                           
              assess the safety of earth dams.                                               
                                                                                             
              The study will provide a comprehensive knowledge base for                      
              evaluation of seismic safety of earth dams.
