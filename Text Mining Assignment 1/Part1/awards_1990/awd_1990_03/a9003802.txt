Abstract    :
                   Theoretical research in elementary particle physics will                  
              focus on (1) The phenomenological and cosmological implications                
              of extra Higgs bosons, (2) The implications for supersymmetry                  
              if a Higgs boson were to be discovered within the next two                     
              years, (3) Study of whether a potential instability of the                     
              standard model ground state is empirically acceptable, and (4)                 
              A proposal for a new class of experiments searching for lepton                 
              number violation at the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator                   
              Facility.                                                                      
                   The Higgs bosons represent the one aspect of the weak                     
              nuclear force about which essentially nothing is yet known.                    
              Yet, they are a very central aspect of our understanding of                    
              this force.  Thus, study of these bosons is extremely                          
              important.  Lepton number violation has never been seen, but                   
              its existence is predicted by a number of intriguing models, so                
              searching for it is of considerable interest.
