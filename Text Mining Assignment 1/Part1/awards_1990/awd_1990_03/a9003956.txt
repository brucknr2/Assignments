Abstract    :
                This research is to investigate the possible changes in                      
              compressional and shear-wave velocities associated with                        
              increasing metamorphic grade by determination of seismic                       
              velocities of samples from the Pikwitonei-Sachigo subprovinces,                
              northwestern Superior Province, in Manitoba, Canada.                           
              Measurements will be made at laboratory confining pressures up to              
              600 MPa.  Particular emphasis will be placed on data across the                
              amphibolite-granulite facies boundary.  In addition to addressing              
              this important question, the study will also provide key rock                  
              properties data for interpretation of geophysical data to be                   
              collected by the planned Canadian LITHOPROBE project in the                    
              northwestern Superior Province.
