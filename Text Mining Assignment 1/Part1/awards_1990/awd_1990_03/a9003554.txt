Abstract    :
              Analyses of the published sulfur isotopic data on bulk rock samples            
              of Archean sediments have led to a new model for the Archean                   
              atmosphere-ocean-biosphere system:  the oceans, as far back as                 
              about 3.8-3.2 billion years ago, were already sulfate rich with a              
              sulfate concentration of > about 1/3 of the present level, were 30-            
              40 oC warmer than modern oceans, and supported a very high activity            
              of sulfate reducing bacteria world wide; the early Archean                     
              atmosphere already contained appreciable amounts of free oxygen.               
              The objective of the proposed research is to test the above and                
              other models for the Archean atmosphere-ocean-biosphere by                     
              examining the sulfur-carbon-iron chemistry and the microscopic-                
              scale variation in the sulfur, carbon and oxygen isotopic                      
              compositions of sediments from the Warrawoona Group, Australia; the            
              Isua Group, Greenland; and the Fig Tree Group, South Africa, using             
              a state-of-the-art stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer equipped             
              with a laser ablation system.
