Abstract    :
                   This project involves research into subband coding for video              
              applications, including advanced television, video conferencing,               
              and high-definition television (HDTV). The subband coding structure            
              has been found to be an attractive way of incorporating both coding            
              efficiency as well as resolution-compatibility between video                   
              formats. Aditionally, pyramid based motion compensation strategies             
              can be used within the subband structure to further enhance the                
              coding efficiency. Three-dimensional subband coding offers exciting            
              new possibilities to directly consider locally planar motions                  
              within the coder module.
