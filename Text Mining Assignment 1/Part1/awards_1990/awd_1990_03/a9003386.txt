Abstract    :
                   This award will help to fund a Special Year in Real                       
              Algebraic Geometry and Qradratic Forms.  This Special Year will                
              be held during the 1990-91 academic year in the Department of                  
              Mathematics at the University of California, Berkeley.  The                    
              Special Year is centered around the yearlong visits of Knebusch                
              and Broecker, who are experts in real algebraic geometry.  There               
              will be researchers from Europe and North America visiting                     
              Berkeley during this Special Year.  The main activities will be                
              two seminars: one on real algebraic geometry and the other on the              
              algebraic theory of quadratic forms.
