Abstract    :
              The nuclei of many galaxies show evidence of mild activity, such               
              as very broad (but weak) emission due to hydrogen.  These are                  
              generally thought to be scaled-down versions of luminous active                
              galactic nuclei (AGNs), in which matter is probably being accret-              
              ed by a massive black hole.  During the past few years, however,               
              a few investigators have speculated that the properties of low-                
              luminosity AGNs might instead be explained by processes related                
              to central bursts of star formation.  Although this is not a                   
              popular idea, recent evidence from observations of supernovae                  
              lend some support to this idea.  This research will explore this               
              model from both theoretical and observational approaches.                      
                                                                                             
              Dr. Filippenko is an extremely active young astronomer, who has                
              most recently been much concerned with the design and utilization              
              of automated observatories in the study of active galactic nuclei              
              and extragalactic supernovae.  He currently holds a Presidential               
              Young Investigator award.
