Abstract    :
              The goal of this research is development of a new database to aid              
              researchers in automatic recognition of continuous speech.  Dr.                
              Cole will conduct controlled experiments to determine the effect               
              of phonetic context on human recognition of speech excerpts.                   
              Initial studies will make use of phonetically labeled excerpts                 
              from the widely used TIMIT speech database.  Human phonetic                    
              recognition will be measured with varying retention of preceding               
              and following phonetic cues.  Dr. Cole will also attempt to                    
              design neural-network classification algorithms that match human               
              phonetic classification performance.
