Abstract    :
              This grant will support research in several techniques for                     
              encoding acoustic-phonetic information to be used in speaker-                  
              independent continuous-speech recognition.  Time-delay and                     
              recursive neural network architectures will be used for spectral               
              analysis of overlapping speech segments, to be compared with a                 
              Bayesian maximum-likelihood classification of the speech                       
              spectral dynamics.  Neural-network outputs will then be encoded                
              as approximate phonetic distances, with a two-level iterative                  
              training method to optimize overall recognition.  Integration of               
              this system with hidden-Markov speech recognition will also be                 
              studied.
