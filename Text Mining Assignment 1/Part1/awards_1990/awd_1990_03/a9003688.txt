Abstract    :
              Manganese-rich, aluminum-poor modulated layer silicate minerals                
              are to be studied by using an integrated petrologic and                        
              mineralogic approach to assess structural stability.  This study               
              will determine if the misfit between the ideal sheets of                       
              tetrahedra and octahedra is a requirement to produce a modulated               
              layer silicate structure.  In addition, the Grenfell deposit,                  
              Australia, will be studied to determine the effect of sequential               
              metamorphism on the mineral phases.  The work will be done in                  
              collaboration with Dr. R.A. Eggleton of the Australian National                
              University, the Canberra.  Using ultra-high resolution                         
              transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction                   
              techniques.
