Abstract    :
              The study of algorithms involves two important aspects, correctness            
              and complexity.  This project addresses these two aspects from a               
              machine independent viewpoint by using formulas of mathematical                
              logic.  Logic formulas can provide descriptions of solutions to                
              problems which can then be analyzed for their correctness and                  
              complexity.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              Of particular interest is to develop a feasible set of logical                 
              formulas for P, the class of problems which are tractable, i.e., whose         
              solutions require only a polynomial number of machine steps, and in            
              addition, to provide a system for reasoning about the properties of            
              these logical formulas.  Finding a comprehensive description of such a         
              set of formulas would exhibit a machine independent definition of P            
              and have a significant impact on our understanding of the algorithms           
              for this important complexity class.  If successful, this system could         
              provide a method by which one could demonstrate that a given formula           
              is the correct solution to certain problem.  As an alternative to              
              program correctness, this may provide a deeper understanding of                
              algorithmic correctness.
