Abstract    :
                   The existence of the rapid, Younger Dryas climate event in                
              the southern hemisphere is still a matter of great debate.  If                 
              this event had detectable effects in the southern hemisphere,                  
              then variations in climate caused by internal oscillations may be              
              important for altering climate on a global scale.  This proposal               
              requests support to reconstruct the high frequency changes in                  
              climate observed in the southern hemisphere during the last                    
              glacial-interglacial transition, the time of the Younger Dryas                 
              event.  The paleoclimate records will be based on pollen                       
              assemblage variations and D/H ratios in peat sections.  D/H                    
              ratios are a function of temperature and moisture availability.                
              The PIs wish to calibrate the D/H variations for this region and               
              then use the calibration to quantify the variations in the past.               
              Thus the D/H ratios will supplement the pollen data and help to                
              identify what climate parameters changed during the deglaciation.              
              This research is important because we do not yet know the history              
              of climate in the southern hemisphere.  It is necessary to                     
              understand the extent of climate change in this hemisphere before              
              we fully understand the mechanisms of abrupt climate change.
