Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research in the analytic number                   
              theory of automorphic and modular forms of Professor Dorian                    
              Goldfeld of Columbia University. Dr. Goldfeld plans to                         
              investigate the growth of the coefficients of meromorphic modular              
              functions and hopes to derive asymptotic formulas for these in                 
              terms of Kloosterman sums. A related project of Professor                      
              Goldfeld is to relate the arithmetic of a modular elliptic curve               
              to the minimal hyperbolic distance between the zeros of the Hecke              
              cusp form of weight two associated to this curve.                              
                   Non-Euclidean plane geometry began in the early nineteenth                
              century as a mathematical curiosity, but by the end of that                    
              century, mathematicians had realized that many objects of                      
              fundamental importance are non-Euclidean in their basic nature.                
              The detailed study of non-Euclidean plane geometries has given                 
              rise to several branches of modern mathematics, of which the                   
              study of modular and automorphic forms is one of the most active.              
              This field is principally concerned with questions about the                   
              whole numbers, but in its use of geometry and analysis, it                     
              retains connection to its historical roots.
