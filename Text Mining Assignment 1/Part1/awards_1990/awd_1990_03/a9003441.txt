Abstract    :
              The primary goal of this research is to extend the theoretical basis           
              for designing and maintaining programming languages.  The ultimate             
              goal of this line of research is to give programming language                  
              designers more ability to design languages which can be methodically           
              extended in a variety of directions (e.g., the introduction of                 
              parallelism) and implemented on a variety of machines while preserving         
              the correctness of existing programs.  To achieve this goal, a number          
              of basic conceptual issues, and some case studies will be examined to          
              investigate the practical importance of the theory.  The conceptual            
              issues include the relations between operational, denotational, and            
              axiomatic semantics, the definitional and conceptual power of                  
              structured operational semantics, and expressiveness of various                
              sequential and parallel primitive operations.  The case studies may            
              include the design of parallel extensions of ML.
