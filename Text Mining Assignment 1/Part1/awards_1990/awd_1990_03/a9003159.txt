Abstract    :
              Dr. John R. Bleeke of Washington University in St. Louis,                      
              Missouri, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and                      
              Organometallic Chemistry Program to continue studies on                        
              pentadienyl-metal-phosphine complexes.  Bleeke has developed a                 
              route to prepare metallabenzenes from pentadienyl-metal                        
              precursors and plans to prepare numerous compounds of this                     
              type.  This will enable detailed studies of these novel                        
              compounds, including investigation of ring substitution                        
              reactions, ring insertion reactions, and coordination of the                   
              metallabenzenes to other metal centers.                                        
                                                                                             
              In addition, Bleeke will attempt to use pentadienyl-metal-                     
              phosphine complexes to activate C-H and N-H bonds.  Addition of                
              more than one substrate molecule to the metal may be possible                  
              if ring slippage of cyclopentadiene occurs.  In a third                        
              project, nucleophilic attack at the internal carbons of bound                  
              pentadienyl groups to produce optically active products will be                
              investigated.  The results promise to be of fundamental                        
              interest and are relevant to some selective catalytic processes.
