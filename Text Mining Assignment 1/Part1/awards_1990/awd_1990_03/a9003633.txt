Abstract    :
              This project will investigate the genesis of repetitive, self-                 
              organization patterns of texture and composition in volcanic                   
              agates.  These patterns are believed to be interlinked.  Self-                 
              organization of a non-equilibrium system involves the spontaneous              
              generation of a repetitive pattern without preexisting structures              
              or periodic outside causes.  The main patterns to be explored are              
              (a) the systematic interlayering of bands made up of twisted                   
              chalcedony fibers with bands consisting of non-twisted fibers, (b)             
              the associated oscillatory minor-element profile predicted by our              
              present model and revealed by cathodoluminescence, and (c) the                 
              systematically fibrous, length-fast habit of agate quartz.  The                
              proposed research consists of quantitative dynamical modeling of               
              agate crystallization by an autocatalytic mechanism, morphological             
              instability analysis of the crystallization front, microscopic                 
              observations, and trace- and minor-element analyses by ion probe.              
              These analyses will be carried out with the NSF-funded ion probe               
              at MIT.  This project will clarify the dynamics of a self-                     
              organizing system with geochemical, crystallochemical, and                     
              petrological significance, and geochemical factors controlling                 
              crystal morphology and crystalline textures.
