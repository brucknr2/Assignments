Abstract    :
                This project will investigate (i) the acoustic correlates of the             
              segment, syllable, and mora in Icelandic, (ii) the mora timing                 
              hypothesis and the segment timing hypothesis, via the contrasting              
              stress, syllable and rhythm systems in Icelandic, English and Spanish,         
              and (iii) the effects on timing due to within word position and                
              position with higher syntactic and prosodic structures.  The goal is           
              to explore the relationship between phonological and phonetic                  
              components of language and to determine the nature of the timing               
              systems controlling different prosodic constituents.                           
                The interactive component includes research seminar and colloquia,           
              participation in ongoing faculty workshop and lab meetings, and two            
              courses.  The two courses are a graduate research seminar on "Rhythm,          
              Timing and Prosodic Structure" and an undergraduate lecture and lab            
              course on "Linguistics, Law and Science."                                      
                This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to                
              provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in                    
              engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and             
              (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering            
              by providing greater visibility for women scientists and engineers             
              employed in industry, government, and academic institutions.  By               
              encouraging the participation of women in science, it is a valuable            
              investment in the Nation's future scientific vitality.
