Abstract    :
              This proposal requests funds to permit Dr. M. Howard Lee,                      
              Professor of Physics, University of Georgia, to pursue with                    
              Dr. Jongbae Hong, Associate Professor of Physics, Seoul                        
              National University, for a period of 24 months, a program of                   
              cooperative research on the dynamical behavior of an                           
              electron gas.  Specifically, the research will address                         
              problems concerning the frequency or time dependent behavior                   
              of electron gases, such as critical damping of the plasmon,                    
              dynamics of a classical electron gas and the fifth moment,                     
              and dynamics of a layered electron gas.                                        
                                                                                             
              The time and frequency behavior of an electron gas at                          
              metallic densities has been the subject of intense research                    
              by a number of workers during the past decade.  The present                    
              cooperative project is based on advances made in research                      
              under NSF Grant No. INT-8517639 on the time and frequency                      
              dependent response of an electron gas at metallic densities                    
              and at intermediate wave vectors.  This research may                           
              contribute to a better understanding of electronic systems                     
              in metal-oxide-semiconductors and in heterostructures.  This                   
              project is relevant to the objectives of the U.S.-Korea                        
              Cooperative Science Program which seeks to increase the                        
              level of cooperation between U.S. and Korean scientists and                    
              engineers through the exchange of information, ideas,                          
              skills, and techniques and through collaboration on problems                   
              of mutual interest and benefit.  Support for Korean                            
              participation in the project is provided by the Korea                          
              Science and Engineering Foundation (KOSEF).
