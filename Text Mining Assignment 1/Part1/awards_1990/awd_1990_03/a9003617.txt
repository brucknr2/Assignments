Abstract    :
              Single crystal X-ray crystallography is the most powerful                      
              analytical method for structure determination of solids.  In                   
              synthetic inorganic, organic, bioinorganic and organometallic                  
              chemistry, single crystal X-ray diffraction is an invaluable tool              
              to characterize molecular structure.  The information gained from              
              the knowledge of the intermolecular composition and structure                  
              helps to develop new reactions of potentially general interest in              
              catalysis or organic synthesis.                                                
                                                                                             
              This award from the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program will              
              help the Department of Chemistry at the University of California               
              in Berkeley, upgrade the existing X-ray facility.   Among the                  
              areas of chemical research that will be enhanced by the                        
              acquisition are following:
