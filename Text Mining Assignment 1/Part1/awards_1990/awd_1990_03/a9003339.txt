Abstract    :
                   This project will study the mechanisms involved in the                    
              development of pattern and form in embryology.  This is to                     
              develop and analyze mathematical models for generating specific                
              patterns and appendages on the integument, specifically alligator              
              stripe patterns, feather and scale primordia and primate                       
              fingerprints.  The models are constructed around known biological              
              facts and close contact will be maintained with experimental                   
              collaborators.                                                                 
                   The nonlinear partial differential equation systems which                 
              constitute the models will be investigated analytically and                    
              numerically.  The mathematical techniques used will primarily be               
              linear analysis, nonlinear bifurcation theory and numerical                    
              simulation.  Development of appropriate graphical presentation of              
              the patterned solutions of the equations will play an important                
              part.  The results and biological predictions will be compared                 
              with the biological data and hopefully will be used to motivate                
              specific experiments to try and elucidate the real patterning                  
              process.  Much of the research is closely linked to specific                   
              experimental studies currently underway.  The work emphasizes the              
              need for integrating theoretical studies with experimental and                 
              observational facts.
