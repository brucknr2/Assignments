Abstract    :
                The main objective of this research is to determine what                     
              undergraduate school characteristics and student background factors            
              are associated with persistence in mathematics, natural sciences, and          
              engineering, particularly for women and minority students.  The data           
              set is based on a longitudinal sample of 69,000 students who had SAT           
              scores, GRE scores, and accompanying questionnarie responses.  These           
              data include major field of study at three points in time: intended            
              major at high school graduation, actual undergraduate major, and               
              intended graduate major.  The prediction of persistence in these               
              fields will be analyzed with multinomial logit or logistic regression          
              models.                                                                        
                Interactive activities include a course entitled Psychological               
              Measurement in Survey Research, guest lectures on recent works, a talk         
              to students about ETS research and choice of science careers,                  
              statistical advising to faculty and students, and participation in             
              social activities with Hispanic and other minority faculty and                 
              students.                                                                      
                This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to                
              provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in                    
              engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and             
              (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering            
              by providing greater visibility for women scientists and engineers             
              employed in industry, government, and academic institutions.  By               
              encouraging the participation of women in science, it is a valuable            
              investment in the Nation's future scientific vitality.
