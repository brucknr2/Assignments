Abstract    :
              This is a post Loma Prieta earthquake (Oct. 1989)                              
              investigation project in learning from this damaging                           
              event.                                                                         
                                                                                             
              The objective of this project is to utilize the strong-                        
              motion records to validate and improve the current                             
              analytical methods for predicting the drift response of                        
              flat-plate buildings.                                                          
                                                                                             
              It has been demonstrated repeatedly that discrepancies                         
              exist between the analytically predicted response and the                      
              actual response of flat-plate buildings.  Because of                           
              their inherent flexibility, the survivability of flat-                         
              plate buildings very much depends upon controlled drift.                       
              A realistic estimate of lateral drift is therefore                             
              essential for a safe design.                                                   
                                                                                             
              A number of flat-plate and flat-slab buildings, ranging                        
              in height from six to twenty stories, have yielded over                        
              twenty seconds of strong-motion data.   Records from a                         
              selected number of these buildings will be collected for                       
              evaluation of drift response.  Each building will be                           
              analyzed for lateral drift using the code defined lateral                      
              forces and the currently accepted analytical models.  The                      
              analyses will then be repeated for time-history response                       
              using the ground motion recorded at the base of the                            
              buildings.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              By comparing the predicted and the measured response and                       
              using the system identification techniques, the                                
              reliability of the existing models for predicting the                          
              drift response of flat-plate buildings for an earthquake                       
              type of loading could be improved.
