Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project addresses the lessons learned                                     
              from the 17 October 1989 Northern California                                   
              (Loma Prieta) earthquake.                                                      
                                                                                             
              Local soil/geologic conditions can modify                                      
              incoming earthquake strong-motions wave                                        
              trains, causing them to be more damaging.  It                                  
              is well accepted that this effect occurred                                     
              during the Loma Prieta earthquake.  Much can                                   
              be learned about site-specific seismic                                         
              response using the wealth of strong-motion                                     
              data recorded during this earthquake.  But in                                  
              order to understand the observed seismic                                       
              response, a necessary first step is to define                                  
              the area's stratigraphy as precisely as                                        
              possible.  This is the objective of this                                       
              research program.                                                              
                                                                                             
              This project seeks to obtain and to analyze                                    
              all available data on the stratigraphy of the                                  
              Pleistocene fill, the depth to the basement                                    
              rock, and to tabulate all measured physical                                    
              properties of the Pleistocene units for                                        
              correlation with expectable ranges in                                          
              velocity propagation.  The aim is to prepare                                   
              precise stratigraphic fence diagrams, unit                                     
              isopach maps, and to tabulate physical                                         
              properties and downhole testing data for each                                  
              geologic unit penetrated.  These data form a                                   
              first step for other studies, such as in                                       
              defining the seismic response for the                                          
              Oakland-Alameda Bay Bridge area.
