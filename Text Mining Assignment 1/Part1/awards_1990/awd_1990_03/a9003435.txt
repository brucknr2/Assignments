Abstract    :
                   A conference entitled "Beyond the Standard Model II" will                 
              be held at the University of Oklahoma November 1-3, 1990.  This                
              elementary particle physics conference will include discussion                 
              of superstring theory, cosmic strings, supersymmetry, left-right               
              symmetry, conformal field theory, technicolor, subquark models,                
              grand unification, quantum gravity, limits on new particles,                   
              and cosmological consequences of new physics.  The so-called                   
              "standard model" of elementary particle physics is universally                 
              believed to be incomplete, so that conferences devoted to                      
              possible physics beyond the standard model are very important.
