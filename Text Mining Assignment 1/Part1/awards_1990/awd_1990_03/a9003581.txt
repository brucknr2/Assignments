Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project addresses the lessons learned                                     
              from the 17 October 1989 Northern California                                   
              (Loma Prieta) earthquake.  It addresses the                                    
              seismic performance of tieback retaining                                       
              walls.                                                                         
                                                                                             
              Tieback retaining walls are commonly used for                                  
              the temporary support of excavations for                                       
              building construction.  These types of                                         
              support systems are typically designed on the                                  
              basis of empirical experience with little, if                                  
              any, thought given to seismic design                                           
              requirements.  Questions regarding the                                         
              seismic performance of these types of                                          
              structures are becoming more important with                                    
              the increasing use of these walls for the                                      
              permanent support of excavation cuts.  While                                   
              earthquake-related failures of tieback walls                                   
              have not been reported in the literature, it                                   
              is not clear if this fortunate circumstance                                    
              is due to a conservative (but expensive)                                       
              design practice, or to the limited number of                                   
              cases where these types of walls have been                                     
              subjected to earthquake ground motions.                                        
                                                                                             
              The aim of this project is to enhance the                                      
              current state-of-the-art in the seismic                                        
              design of tieback retaining walls by                                           
              reviewing the performance of existing walls -                                  
               both temporary and permanent - in the San                                     
              Francisco Bay area that were subjected to the                                  
              ground shaking from the Loma Prieta                                            
              earthquake.  Particular emphasis is given to                                   
              tieback walls constructed with the "soil                                       
              nailing" technique, which is relatively new                                    
              in the United States.  Available information                                   
              on the horizontal displacement of the walls                                    
              and/or load increases in the tiebacks within                                   
              the walls, and on any damage experienced, is                                   
              studied; these data are compared to the                                        
              general design practice for these types of                                     
              walls.                                                                         
                                                                                             
              The benefit of this research is that it will                                   
              improve the state of the engineering practice                                  
              in the design of permanent tieback walls.                                      
              This should facilitate the widespread use of                                   
              tieback retaining walls in areas of high                                       
              seismicity, leading to a safer and more                                        
              economical design.
