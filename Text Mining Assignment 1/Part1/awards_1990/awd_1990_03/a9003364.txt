Abstract    :
                   This is a study to investigate the transmission of errors by              
              the teleconnection processes in the atmosphere.  The project                   
              consists of three parts, (a) to use the DERF dataset for testing               
              the hypothesis that the location of maximum response to tropical               
              forcing is "phase locked", (b) to examine the response of a                    
              simplified NMC GCM to a variety of tropical forcing scenarios,                 
              and (c) to investigate the response of the NMC operational GCM to              
              tropical forcing.                                                              
                   This project is important because it will help to clarify a               
              potentially significant source of uncertainty in the present                   
              meteorological operational data analyses.  In addition the study               
              will benefit the ongoing efforts for designing more effective                  
              observational platforms and networks.
