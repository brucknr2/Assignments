Abstract    :
              This research is being funded by the Organic Synthesis Program.                
              Dr. Overman will continue his development of new ring forming                  
              reactions, particularly focussing on the medium ring range.                    
              This will provide some of the new tools required by the                        
              increasingly complex demands of agriculture and industry.                      
                                                                                             
              The studies for the project focus in two areas: (1) Developing                 
              new cyclization reactions for forming medium rings.  Of all                    
              types of rings (small, common, medium and large) existing                      
              methods are least satisfactory for preparing medium rings.  (2)                
              Developing electrophilic cyclization reactions that are                        
              promoted by nucleophiles.  Reactions of this type were recently                
              discovered and hold exciting promise for greatly expanding the                 
              utility of simple alkynes in chemical synthesis.
