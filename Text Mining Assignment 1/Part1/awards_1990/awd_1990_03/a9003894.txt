Abstract    :
              This is an SGER proposal to develop and evaluate a new                         
              method of bonding strain gauges to bone; current methods                       
              of bonding do not last for a sufficiently long time to                         
              allow an engineering analysis of bone healing.  The                            
              proposed approach is to coat the transducer with synthetic                     
              hydroxyapatite (closely related to compounds found in                          
              natural bone) to facilitate the development of a strong                        
              bond.  Very preliminary experiments have been promising,                       
              and the purpose of this proposal is to optimize and                            
              evaluate this technique using in-vivo preparations.                            
              Reliable transducers will contribute significantly to basic                    
              engineering studies into the mechanisms of bone healing.
