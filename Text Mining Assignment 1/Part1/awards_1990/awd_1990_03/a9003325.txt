Abstract    :
                   This project shall concentrate on the analysis of solitary                
              wave phenomena.  Several related questions in the analysis of                  
              solitary waves will be examined, including their existence,                    
              uniqueness and stability.  In addition, the validity of various                
              approximate equations and certain rigorous properties of                       
              nonlinear dispersive systems of partial differential or integro-               
              differential equations will be considered.  The tools of                       
              nonlinear analysis will be supplemented by some numerical                      
              simulation and the special methods of inverse scattering theory.               
              The systems to be studied arise in many areas of nonlinear                     
              science including fluid mechanics, nonlinear optics, solid state               
              physics, oceanography and meteorology.
