Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The principal investigator will study several problems in                 
              differential geometry as applied to the theory of minimal                      
              surfaces.  One involves an approach to proving the isometric                   
              inequality for minimal surfaces.  The second involves applying                 
              generalized Morse index theory to obtain a sharp estimate for the              
              index of a minimal surface.  And he will analyze the problem of                
              globally reflecting a constant mean curvature surface which meets              
              a plane at a constant angle.                                                   
                   Two-dimensional minimal surfaces are mathematical models of               
              soap films.  These must have zero mean curvature.  The surface of              
              a saddle has zero mean curvature if at each point the amount of                
              curvature in the upward direction exactly cancels the amount in                
              the downward direction.  The principal investigator will study                 
              various problems concerning the number of tubes such minimal                   
              surfaces may have.
