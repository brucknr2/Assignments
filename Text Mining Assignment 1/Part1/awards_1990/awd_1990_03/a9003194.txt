Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This modestly high power dilution refrigerator will be used for                
              studies of spin-polarized quantum systems.  This refrigerator                  
              will be used in collaborative efforts to study atomic hydrogen                 
              with a Lyman-alpha laser, to study and develop a cryogenic                     
              hydrogen maser (CHM), to study atomic scattering at low                        
              temperatures, and a number of other experiments.  The laser                    
              experiment is directed at obtaining conditions for Bose-Einstein               
              condensation, which would be of fundamental significance for                   
              physics.  In addition, the laser provides a valuable diagnostic                
              tool for the study of atoms in magnetic traps.  The CHM promises               
              not only to be more stable than any existing oscillator, but by                
              virtue of its stability will enable precise measurements of                    
              interaction constants in this fundamental system.  Scattering                  
              experiments will enable the determination of many very important               
              cross sections never before measured.  A number of other                       
              experiments promise to yield rich new phenomena.
