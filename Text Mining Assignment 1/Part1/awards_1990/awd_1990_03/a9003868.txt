Abstract    :
              Within recent years the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe have                   
              undergone major changes at a dramatic pace.  While it might be                 
              expected that political values in a culture influence processes                
              of change, there is little systematic knowledge about the legal                
              and political culture of the Soviet Union.  This research                      
              constitutes a unique and important opportunity to advance our                  
              understanding of how beliefs, values, and attitudes of ordinary                
              citizens structure both the pace and the possibility of change.                
              The core of the study is a survey of public opinion in greater                 
              Moscow.  It is anticipated that approximately 500 respondents                  
              will be interviewed face-to-face in hour long sessions.  While                 
              the research team is an interdisciplinary group of U.S. scholars,              
              the data collection itself will be performed under the direction               
              of the Institute of Sociology, National Academy of Sciences.                   
                                                                                             
              This research anticipates several contributions.  First, it                    
              should enable developing a profile of the major attributes of                  
              Soviet legal and political culture.  Second, it should permit                  
              testing a variety of hypotheses about the origins of Soviet                    
              values.  Third, these survey data should lend themselves to                    
              exploratory analyses of the differences in value content and                   
              structure between the Soviet Union, Western Europe, and the                    
              United States.  Finally, the survey will be extremely useful in                
              establishing baseline data for studying processes of political                 
              change in the future.
