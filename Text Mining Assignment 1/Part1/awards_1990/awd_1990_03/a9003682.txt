Abstract    :
                   This is a grant under the Scientific Computing Research                   
              Equipment for the Mathematical Sciences program of the Division                
              of Mathematical Sciences of the National Science Foundation.                   
              This program supports the purchase of special purpose computing                
              equipment dedicated to the conduct of research in the                          
              mathematical sciences.  This equipment is required for several                 
              research projects and would be difficult to justify for one                    
              project alone.  Support from the National Science Foundation is                
              coupled with discounts and contributions from manufacturers and                
              with substantial cost-sharing from the institutions submitting                 
              the proposal.  This program is an example of academic,                         
              corporate, and government cooperation in the support of the basic              
              research in the mathematical sciences.                                         
                   This equipment will be used to support four research                      
              projects in  the Department of Engineering Science and Applied                 
              Mathematics of  Northwestern University.  The names of the                     
              investigators and the titles of their projects follow: Numerical               
              Study of Non-adiabatic Gaseous Fuel Combustion, Bayliss and                    
              Matkowsky; Numerical Study of Gasless Combustion, Bayliss and                  
              Matkowsky; Numerical Solution of Integro-partial Differential                  
              Equations in Stochastic Dynamics, Matkowsky; and Numerical                     
              Simulations of Activation in Stochastic Dynamics, Matkowsky.
