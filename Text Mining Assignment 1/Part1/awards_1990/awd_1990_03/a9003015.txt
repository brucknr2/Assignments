Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Dr. Choi's group has done some internally funded on the                        
                                                                                             
              effects of ultrasonic waves on the melting process and has                     
                                                                                             
              found some very interesting effects.  Specifically, he found                   
                                                                                             
              melting rates enhanced by as much as 250%, modifications to                    
                                                                                             
              the form of the phase-interface, and a dependance of the                       
                                                                                             
              behavior on the applied ultrasonic frequency.  While the                       
                                                                                             
              experiments appear to demonstrate an effect, the physics                       
                                                                                             
              behind the phenomenon have not been elucidated.                                
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
              Dr. Choi proposes to perform similar experiments for the case                  
                                                                                             
              of solidification.  With recent interest in the use of phase-

              during solidification is of extreme importance.  If the                        
                                                                                             
              application of ultrasonic waves can enable the control of the
