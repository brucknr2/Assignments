Abstract    :
              This award will support development of an interactive multimedia               
              program for the teaching of Japanese to English speaking scientists            
              and engineers.  The materials will be contextually grounded in                 
              situations and settings relevant to individuals going to Japan for             
              the purpose of collaborative research.  The learner will be                    
              exposed to interactions, characters, and scenarios in much the                 
              same way that she/he would experience these occurrences:  randomly             
              (as the video proceeds forward inviting the user to stop and                   
              select various options) or selectively (as action attracts                     
              interest). Interspersed with the "events" in a simulation will be              
              a wide variety of linguistic exercises based on the core conversa-             
              tions of the textbook, Japanese:  The Spoken Language, by Jorden               
              and Noda (Yale University Press).  Users will be able to selectively           
              access linguistic and cultural background information far more                 
              detailed than what is currently available in any textbook.                     
                                                                                             
              There is a critical need for more effective communications between             
              American and Japanese researchers.  This project will help to                  
              address that need by integrating state-of-the art technology with              
              sound principles of language pedagogy to produce a multimedia-                 
              based program of Japanese language instruction oriented to                     
              scientists and engineers.
