Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will study various problems                    
              associated with the numerical solution of differential equations               
              that govern incompressible and compressible flows of fluids.  In               
              particular, he will study vortex methods for incompressible                    
              flows, the numerical capturing of oscillatory solutions of                     
              gasdynamic equations, and the use of dispersive approximations in              
              the solution of compressible flow problems.                                    
                   Fluid flow problems in two and three space dimensions are                 
              governed by complicated systems of nonlinear partial differential              
              equations.  Often the only practical way to solve such systems is              
              to use a computer to generate approximate numerical solutions.                 
              But this is not all that easy either.  The principal investigator              
              will use what is called a vortex method to generate numerical                  
              solutions of the equations of incompressible and compressible                  
              fluid flow.  This basic method and the improvements on it made by              
              the principal investigator allow one to find accurate solutions                
              in an efficient manner.
