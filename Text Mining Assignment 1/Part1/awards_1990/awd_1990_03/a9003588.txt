Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project addresses the lessons learned                                     
              from the 17 October 1989 Northern California                                   
              (Loma Prieta) earthquake.                                                      
                                                                                             
              The aim is to evaluate critical parameters of                                  
              the Loma Prieta earthquake ground motions                                      
              (including after shocks) that have                                             
              engineering significance, and to demonstrate                                   
              the use of these parameters in predicting the                                  
              damageability of future Bay Area earthquakes.                                  
              Information on the duration, time-variation                                    
              and breadth of frequency content, cyclic                                       
              history, etc. - motion properties known to                                     
              have important effects on structural damage,                                   
              but which are difficult to define and use                                      
              explicitly - this information is incorporated                                  
              implicitly in the characterization.                                            
                                                                                             
              A comparison is made between the predicted                                     
              and observed damage-effective motion                                           
              characteristics for the Loma Prieta                                            
              earthquake.  The observed analytical                                           
              characterizations are used to explain                                          
              specific cases of building damage and non-                                     
              damage, while the influence of the soil on                                     
              the motion characterizations is determined                                     
              statistically.  These data from the Loma                                       
              Prieta earthquake are combined with data                                       
              computed for earlier events.                                                   
                                                                                             
              The project is expected to result in improved                                  
              statistical formulas for the                                                   
              magnitude/distance/soil dependence of                                          
              nonlinear damageability.  These formulas,                                      
              when combined with local soils data, are used                                  
              to conduct probabilistic hazard analyses to                                    
              derive maps of the damageability of future                                     
              Bay Area earthquakes.
