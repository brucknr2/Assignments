Abstract    :
                   Heating of the ionosphere with intense radio waves has been               
              pursued vigorously over the last thirty years, primarily in the                
              United States and the Soviet Union.  New, large facilities have                
              been constructed in the United States and in Europe.  During the               
              1970's, the branches of plasma physics known as weak turbulence                
              theory and the theory of parametric instabilities were used to                 
              explain some of the unusual and unexpected results of the heating              
              efforts.  The PIs' recent work, inspired by Petviashvili and                   
              followed by that of DuBois, Rose, and others, has demonstrated                 
              the importance of modulational instability followed by Langmuir                
              soliton formation and collapse.  The PI proposes to continue his               
              study of these effects using analytical and numerical techniques.
