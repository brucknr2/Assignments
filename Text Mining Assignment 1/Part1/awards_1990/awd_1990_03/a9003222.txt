Abstract    :
                   Professor Gaillard will study the structure of Harish-                    
              Chandra modules for semisimple Lie groups.  In particular he will              
              study the relationship of the representation algebra and the                   
              extension algebra and try to show that they are dual formal                    
              algebras in the sense of Beilinson and Ginsburg, a conjecture he               
              has verified already in special cases.                                         
                   This research involves the theory of group representations.               
              Group theory is basically the study of symmetry.  To take an                   
              example, when the system in question is invariant under a change               
              in the position of the origin of space, the group of translations              
              naturally arises.  While groups are abstract objects, particular               
              situations demand concrete realizations or "representations" of                
              the symmetry group.
