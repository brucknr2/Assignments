Abstract    :
                   The statistical problems of ranking and selection,                        
              hypothesis testing, estimation and prediction in two-way and                   
              higher-way layout experiments will be investigated from a                      
              Bayesian perspective.  Hierarchical Bayesian procedures may be                 
              implemented for everyday use through the realization that only                 
              low-dimensional numerical integration is needed for many commonly              
              used models and that the efficient computational methods to                    
              evaluate these integrals are available.  The goals of this                     
              research are to characterize the multi-way classification                      
              problems, to provide hierarchical Bayesian solution for the                    
              models identified in the characterization, and to develop                      
              efficient algorithms to compute the required integrals needed to               
              implement the Bayesian methodology.
