Abstract    :
              The objectives of this proposal are (1) to improve the total                   
              internal-reflection microscopy (TIMR) to measure absolute                      
              distances between a submicron particle and a solid wall, and                   
              (2) to study the dynamics of Brownian motion of particles in                   
              the vicinity of a solid wall.  TIMR technique was initially                    
              developed by Dr. Prieve.  It measures the interaction                          
              potential between a particle and a wall.  Interaction forces                   
              as small as a few picograms have been experimentally                           
              determined with this technique.  In this project, TIMR will be                 
              applied to study the dynamics of hindered Brownian motion of a                 
              sphere and diffusion coefficients near a wall.                                 
                                                                                             
              The results can be related to the rates of flocculation and                    
              deposition of particles from moving fluids.
