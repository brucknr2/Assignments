Abstract    :
                   Proposed research in the Devonian of the western U.S. involves            
              five areas of endeavor.  1. Brachiopod systematics: one new                    
              brachiopod genus will be described and illustrated.  In addition,              
              the section on Silurian and Devonian spirifers will be prepared for            
              the revised Brachiopod Treatise.  Precise range data will be                   
              collated for Devonian brachiopod general.  2. The Middle and Upper             
              Devonian faunal sequence will be studied and refined by synthesis              
              of five measured sections and 229 fossil samples.  Zonal refinement            
              is anticipated near the top of the Middle Devonian.  3. The                    
              depositional history of an interval of the Late Devonian spanning              
              the Frasnian-Famennian boundary will be studied in central Nevada.             
              Quartz sands were deposited in the outer shelf basin at that time              
              as a result of platform emergence.  4. It is intended to analyze               
              geology in two critical areas along the frontal margin of the                  
              Roberts Mountains thrust from data gathered during the last 14                 
              years.  5. A review paper is planned for preparation on the                    
              Paleozoic of the western U.S.
