Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project focuses on lessons that can be                                    
              learned from the October 17, 1989 Loma Prieta                                  
              Earthquake.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              The project will be a longitudinal,                                            
              comparative case study of sheltering and                                       
              housing in the aftermath of the earthquake.                                    
              It will specifically address the                                               
              sheltering/housing needs and problems of low-                                  
              income Hispanics as compared to a non-Hispanic                                 
              community.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              The methodology will be based on in-depth                                      
              interviews with local, state, and federal                                      
              officials and within Hispanic community                                        
              organizations.  All phases of post-disaster                                    
              sheltering and housing will be studied.  The                                   
              study sites will be Watsonville and Santa                                      
              Cruz, California.
