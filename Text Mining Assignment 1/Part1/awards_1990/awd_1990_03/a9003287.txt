Abstract    :
              The research project is concerned with the numerical solution of               
              several classes of linear and nonlinear integral equations.                    
              Specific types of integral equations slated for study include                  
              linear and nonlinear boundary integral equations, nonlinear                    
              Urysohn equations and nonlinear Fredholm equations.  Such                      
              equations arise in a host of pure and applied areas, and one of                
              the goals of the research is the development of multi-purpose                  
              codes that can be fitted into software routines to enable                      
              researchers from many different disciplines to solve these                     
              integral equations efficiently and accurately.  Very often the                 
              solution of a problem in mathematical physics or mathematical                  
              biology can be expressed in the form of an integral equation.                  
              However this does not mean that the problem is solved; rather,                 
              the resulting integral equation must be solved either                          
              analytically or numerically.  In this proposal the researchers                 
              will improve existing numerical schemes and develop new ones in                
              order to produce multi-purpose software for the approximate                    
              solution of several types of integral equations in several space               
              dimensions.
