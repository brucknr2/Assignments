Abstract    :
                   The atmospheric chemistry and gas-to-particle conversion                  
              phenomena of biogenic hydrocarbon systems will be investigated                 
              in this research project.  The goals of the research are to                    
              elucidate the gas-phase photooxidation pathways of key biogenic                
              hydrocarbons, to identify the aerosol-forming capability of                    
              these hydrocarbons, to further understanding of gas-to-particle                
              conversion phenomena in atmospheric organic systems, and to                    
              evaluate the applicability of nucleation theories to                           
              atmospheric species.                                                           
                   Outdoor smog chamber experiments will be conducted with                   
              isoprene/NOx and beta pinene/NOx mixture over a spectrum of                    
              concentration levels.  Quantities to be measured include                       
              hydrocarbon, O3, NO, NO2 concentrations, aerosol size                          
              distributions by differential mobility analyzer, optical                       
              particle counter and epiphianiometer, and aerosol molecular                    
              composition by GC/MS and FTIR analyses.  Aerosol species                       
              identified will be studied for nucleation either as single                     
              component or binary, with water.  Theoretical work will                        
              continue on the development of a kinetic theory of nucleation.                 
              Analysis of the experimental data will involve a description of                
              gas-phase chemical reaction mechanisms, including the                          
              generation of condensable species, the nucleation of these                     
              species, either homomolecular or binary, and the diffusion of                  
              these and additional species to particles.
