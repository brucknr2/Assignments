Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project focuses upon lessons that can be learned from the                 
              Loma Prieta Earthquake of October 17, 1989.                                    
                                                                                             
              The project is a one-year comparative study of disaster                        
              impacts and initial community recovery activities in                           
              Charleston County, South Carolina and Santa Cruz County,                       
              California.  These two counties, which are roughly comparable                  
              in population size, both recently sustained extensive damage                   
              in two major natural disasters, Hurricane Hugo (Charleston)                    
              and the Loma Prieta earthquake (Santa Cruz).                                   
                                                                                             
              The objectives of the study are to (1) document disaster                       
              impacts and early recovery issues and activities in the two                    
              communities; (2) develop a set of socio-economic indicators                    
              that can be used to chart disaster recovery, and begin                         
              collecting data on those indicators; and (3) conduct                           
              comparative analyses and develop hypotheses concerning factors                 
              that explain outcomes in the recovery period.                                  
                                                                                             
              Data for the study will come from archives, documents,                         
              community statistics, and other records, as well as from in-                   
              depth interviews with representatives of key organizations in                  
              both communities.
