Abstract    :
              This project is aimed at developing new conceptual and                         
              mathematical methods for the general analysis of mechanical                    
              efficiency and performance limitations of reciprocating                        
              kinematic heat engines.  The project is motivated by two                       
              recent discoveries which, taken together, indicate that                        
              realistically complex engine mechanisms can be treated in                      
              mathematically closed form fashion.  The discoveries arose                     
              from prior work on establishing mathematically explicit and                    
              general limits on the mechanical efficiency of kinematic                       
              engines which are analogous to the well known Carnot limits on                 
              thermal efficiency.  The prior work was restricted to highly                   
              idealized engine mechanisms models.  The present project makes                 
              use of a new abstract approach to model engine mechanisms                      
              which allow significant relaxation or essentially complete                     
              removal of the idealizations and restrictions of the earlier                   
              work.  The results of the proposed new work will be more                       
              faithfully representative of actual practice while retaining a                 
              broad general range of applicability.  This will not only                      
              provide more detailed insight into the specific practical                      
              problems involved in extracting useful work from heat engines,                 
              but it will also furnish a new ability to address global                       
              problems important to practical heat engine design and                         
              development such as the optimal matching of thermodynamic                      
              cycles and engine mechanisms.
