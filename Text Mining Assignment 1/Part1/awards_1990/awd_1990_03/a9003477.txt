Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project addresses the lessons learned                                     
              from the 17 October 1989 Northern California                                   
              (Loma Prieta) earthquake.  It is a                                             
              continuation of a joint project with                                           
              Professor Jean-Lou Chameau at Purdue                                           
              University that was funded through the Small                                   
              Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER)                                          
              program: The objectives of this project were:                                  
              to gather relevant geotechnical data; to map                                   
              ground features that are important to                                          
              identify the extent of liquefaction and                                        
              ground amplification effects; perform about                                    
              30 cone penetration tests at locations where                                   
              earlier tests had been conducted; organize                                     
              the above information into a computerized                                      
              data base; and make preliminary assessments                                    
              of the correlation between field observations                                  
              and data obtained before and after the 1989                                    
              earthquake.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              The objectives of this continuation joint                                      
              research project are to study the ground                                       
              motion and liquefaction characteristics of                                     
              the fill soils that surround the northern and                                  
              eastern periphery of San Francisco as well as                                  
              areas south of San Francisco.  The fill soils                                  
              are a major element in the damages that                                        
              occurred in the Bay Area due to the Loma                                       
              Prieta earthquake.  Drs. G.R. Martin and E.                                    
              Kavazanjian of Earth Technology Corporation                                    
              in Long Beach, CA, are participating as                                        
              advisors, and the cone penetration and                                         
              dilatometer testing is being accomplished                                      
              using equipment of the Earth Technology                                        
              Corporation.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              The motivation for this project lies in: the                                   
              important lessons that can be learned from                                     
              the observed response of the fills and                                         
              underlying recent sediments to the                                             
              earthquake; the unique opportunity to study                                    
              sites that had been investigated in the                                        
              1970's and 80's and where specific                                             
              predictions had been made as to expected                                       
              performance; the ability to use the observed                                   
              performance as a field laboratory to test the                                  
              latest developments in the state-of-the-art;                                   
              and the opportunity to generate results from                                   
              research that has direct value in San                                          
              Francisco and nearby communities.
