Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This dissertation research grant will support an anthropology                  
              graduate student investigating peasant responses to state                      
              divestment and reprivatization of the Mexican sugar industry.                  
              The Mexican state recently sold the majority of its sugar mills                
              to national and transnational corporations, thus weakening the                 
              relationship between the cane producers unions and the state.                  
              The research will examine how this divestment affects local                    
              peasant producers.  Hypotheses to be tested are that credit will               
              be distributed more unevenly, socioeconomic differentiation will               
              increase in general, local level decision making over production               
              will decrease, and that the state will mediate between unions and              
              mill owners.  Methods include a census of one village,                         
              participant observation of producers, unions, and mills,                       
              structured interviews, oral histories, archival data.                          
                                                                                             
              This research is important because it will help us understand the              
              strategies rural producers adopt in the face of changes in                     
              corporate ownership of economic institutions.  This knowledge is               
              critical to the resolution of political unrest attendant on                    
              increased societal problems associated with debt restructuring in              
              the Third World.
