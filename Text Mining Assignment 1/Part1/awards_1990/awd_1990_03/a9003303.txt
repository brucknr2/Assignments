Abstract    :
              The objectives of this study are the identification of                         
              intermediates in the partial and total oxidations of olefins                   
              on silver (110) surfaces, and quantification of the energetics                 
              of elementary steps in these processes.  This includes, for                    
              partial oxidation, the production, identification, and                         
              characterization of the metallocycle intermediates relevant to                 
              catalytic oxidtion by both atomically and molecularaly                         
              adsorbed oxygen, and, for total oxidation , the investigation                  
              of the mechanism of propylene combustion.  Electron energy                     
              loss spectroscopy is used to identify adsorbed intermediates                   
              and to measure the rates of reactions in which they                            
              participate, and temperature-programmed desorption is used to                  
              identify desorption products and to measure the rates of                       
              desorption.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              Partial oxidation of olefins, the process involved in this                     
              study, is of great commerical importance, but as presently                     
              practiced, can be applied only to a very few olefins.  The                     
              results of this study could lead to better control and                         
              improved yields in the existing process.  More significantly,                  
              it may point the way for extending this approach to additional                 
              olefins, which would represent a technological breakthough.
