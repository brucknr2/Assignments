Abstract    :
              The goal of this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and                    
              Organometallic Chemistry Program is the synthesis and                          
              characterization of a wide variety of new fluorine-containing                  
              nitrogen and/or phosphorus compounds. It is expected that the                  
              presence of fluorine will endow the new compounds with                         
              desirable properties, such as special high temperature                         
              stabilities and concommitant high densities and long liquid                    
              ranges, compared to nonfluorinated analogs.                                    
                                                                                             
              The target compounds for synthesis are in three families:                      
              (A) fluorinated cyclophosphazenes and polyphosphazenes;                        
              (B) fluorinated tetrazoles and other tetraza-5-membered ring                   
              systems; and (C) fluorinated high-nitrogen compounds. Many of                  
              the new compounds will be synthesized by procedures analogous                  
              to those used for nonfluorinated analogs, but using fluorinated                
              starting materials. In other cases fluorination will be                        
              accomplished with either carbonyl fluoride or trifluoroamine                   
              oxide. The new compounds will be characterized by a variety of                 
              spectroscopic methods and by x-ray and electron diffraction                    
              structural techniques.
