Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project continues the existing support for research in                    
              Mexico of several cultural anthropologists from the University of              
              California-Berkeley.  The project studies the medical and                      
              pharmacological ethnobotanical knowledge of a group of Mayan                   
              Indians living in the state of Chiapas, Mexico.  The project will              
              prepare an encyclopedia of plants with their medicinal and                     
              pharmacological properties and local customary uses, as well as                
              herbarium collections in Mexico and in the USA.                                
                                                                                             
              This project is important because the traditional knowledge of                 
              Indian peoples is a valuable part of our human biodiversity                    
              resources.  By analyzing these local communities' ethnobotanical               
              and ethnopharmacological knowledge, and matching that knowledge                
              with biological assays of the biochemical properties of the                    
              plants, this project will add to our understanding of the nature               
              of traditional ethnobotanical knowledge.
