Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research on p-adic Galois repre-                  
              sentations of Professor Shankar Sen of Cornell University. Dr.                 
              Sen's project consists of two parts: the first is to relate the                
              generalized Hodge-Tate structure of the representation to the                  
              various p-adic liftings of global Galois representations over the              
              prime field in characteristic p. The other part is to extend                   
              previous work of Dr. Sen that described p-adic field extensions                
              by means of certain semi-linear integral representations of p-                 
              power cyclic groups.                                                           
                   Except for counting, number theory, which is the study of                 
              the properties of the whole numbers, is the oldest branch of                   
              mathematics. In modern days, problems in number theory have                    
              furnished the driving force to creation of new mathematics in the              
              fields of pure algebra, analysis, and geometry; some of the most               
              recent and most astonishing applications of number theory have                 
              appeared in theoretical computer science and coding theory.
