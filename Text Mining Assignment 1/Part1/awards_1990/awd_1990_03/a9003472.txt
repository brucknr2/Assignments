Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project focuses upon lessons that can be                                  
              learned from the October 17, 1989 Loma Prieta                                  
              Earthquake.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              Existing knowledge about the effective                                         
              communication of public disaster warnings                                      
              largely rests on a data base of pre-impact                                     
              warnings.  A gap exists regarding knowledge                                    
              about the determinants and process whereby the                                 
              public hears, perceives and responds to                                        
              warnings during the post-impact disaster                                       
              emergency period.  This research is a study of                                 
              public perception and response to aftershock                                   
              warnings following the Loma Prieta Earthquake.                                 
              Mail questionnaires will collect relevant data                                 
              on 800 households representing San Francisco                                   
              (a media rich environment) and Santa Cruz (a                                   
              media sparse environment) households.  The                                     
              process and determinants of that process                                       
              whereby the public hears, perceives and                                        
              responds to warnings during the immediate                                      
              aftermath of a disaster will be determined.                                    
              Quick-response field research after this quake                                 
              suggest that there is much to be learned.                                      
              This quake provides an opportunity to conduct                                  
              a systematic study on this topic for perhaps                                   
              the first time.
