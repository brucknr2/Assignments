Abstract    :
                This research will analyze the October 17, 1989, Loma Prieta,                
              California, earthquake source mechanism by comparison with the                 
              great 1906 San Francisco earthquake which ruptured the San                     
              Andreas fault in the same segment.  One of the most interesting                
              and unexpected aspects of the Loma Prieta earthquake is that the               
              mechanism indicated by preliminary results has a significant                   
              thrust component (about 1/2 the total) which suggests an uplift                
              of about 1 meter.  If the oblique-slip mechanism is                            
              characteristic of the events occurring along this segment, we                  
              would expect a long-term uplift rate of 1 cm/year, which appears               
              much higher than inferred from the regional geomorphology.  The                
              seismograms from the 1906 event will be analyzed to look for the               
              presence of a similar thrust component.  This research is a                    
              contribution to the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
