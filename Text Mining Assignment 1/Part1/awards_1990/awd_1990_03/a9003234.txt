Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The sea snail Aplysia possesses very large nerve cells which                   
              enable researchers to study the nervous system at the molecular                
              and cellular level.  Analytical techniques are used to study the               
              cellular changes which form the biological basis for habituation               
              and learning in this mollusc.  Aplysia, and other related                      
              species, have been useful in the investigation of the                          
              neurological basis of complex behavioral patterns.  A conference,              
              under the auspices of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, has been              
              planned to assemble researchers studying the cell and molecular                
              biology of Aplysia.  The intent of this meeting is to discuss new              
              methods and findings that have emerged from the successful                     
              utilization of the Aplysian nervous system.
