Abstract    :
                   This grant is for support of a Chapman Conference in                      
              "magnetospheric substorms" in Hakone, Japan.  Chapman conference               
              are topical meetings sponsored by the American Geophysical Union               
              and are designed to promote opportunities not normally available               
              through the format of large meetings.  The funds will be used to               
              partially support the travel expenses of some US graduate                      
              students and scientist.  The site has been chosen to encourage                 
              international participation, especially from Asian and                         
              Australian scientists.  The main objective of the proposed                     
              conference is to provide an opportunity to present the results of              
              recent progress on substroms and to build up a focused picture on              
              this topic.  ***
