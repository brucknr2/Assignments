Abstract    :
              The high-pressure stability of majority garnet will be                         
              experimentally determined at 165-230 kbar pressures, 1650and                   
              higher temperatures, with the split-sphere anvil apparatus in                  
              Stony Brook (USSA-2000).  The study would include: 1. The                      
              determination of the equilibrium compositions of enstatite-                    
              jadeite garnet coexisting with MgSiO3 ilmenite, and NaAlSiO4                   
              (calcium ferrite structure) + stishovite; 2. The determination of              
              the compositions of diopside-jadeite garnet coexisting with                    
              pyroxene, CaSiO3 perovskite, and NaAlSiO4 + stishovite.  The                   
              compositions of enstatite-pyrope garnet coexisting with MgSiO3-                
              Al2O3 perovskite would be determined at 220-280 kbar, 2000oC, If               
              new developments are successful in reaching those pressures.  The              
              results of the proposed experiments would place new constraints                
              on the nature of the 650 km discontinuity, and on the cause of                 
              the high-velocity gradients in the vicinity of the 650 km                      
              discontinuity.  The results would also allow to evaluate the                   
              effect of sodium on the CMAS phase relations, which would lead                 
              to a better understanding of the Earth Mantle mineralogy.                      
              Supplementary projects could include: 1. The determination of the              
              melting curves of simple compounds at 165-230 kbar, e.g.                       
              Mg4Si4O12 garnet, beta phase, diopside, CaSiO3 perovskite,                     
              grossular, jadeite; 2.  The extension of the CMAS melting                      
              relations to the superphase B - Mg10Si3O14 (OH,F,Cl).4
