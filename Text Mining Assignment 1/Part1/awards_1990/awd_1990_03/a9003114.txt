Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The research is a renewal of a highly productive grant at                      
              Northwestern University (DMR-8701167).  During the three years of              
              support by the National Science Foundation two students were                   
              awarded the doctorate degree, one received the masters degree,                 
              and three students are in   various stages of the doctorate                    
              degree.  Seven papers were accepted for publication in refereed                
              scientific journals, and seven more are in process.  The research              
              during that period emphasized the following:  (1) transition and               
              rare earth metals as electronically active defects in compound                 
              semiconductors,  (2) flow modulation epitaxy of indium phosphide               
              and its alloys,  (3) defects in indium phosphide based                         
              heterostructures.  The current research studies deep level                     
              defects in deliberately doped epitaxial indium phosphide and its               
              alloys prepared by atmospheric pressure organometallic vapor                   
              phase epitaxy.  A number of defect phenomena are being                         
              emphasized, for example, compensation mechanisms in heavily doped              
              material, deep donor levels associated with substitutional                     
              impurities, deep levels in quantum wells and superlattices, and                
              rare earth related impurities.  The materials are being                        
              characterized using photoluminescence, photoconductivity, and                  
              deep level transient spectroscopy.
