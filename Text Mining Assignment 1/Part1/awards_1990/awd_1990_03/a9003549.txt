Abstract    :
                   This award is for the support of an instrument development                
              project at the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism of the                      
              Carnegie Institution of Washington. A laser resonance ionization               
              source mass spectrometer is being developed for the purpose of                 
              measuring Os isotopic ratios and Re and Os concentrations in                   
              natural samples via the isotope dilution method. Currently, the                
              laser ionization of Re and Os takes place in an atom cloud above               
              the sample that is produced by pulsed tantalum filament heating.               
              The relatively slow thermal pulse of the filament compared to the              
              short duration of the pulsed laser causes premature depletion of               
              the atom cloud and limits the ultimate accuracy of the                         
              instrument. The goal of this project is to improve the ion source              
              system by incorporating a pulsed sputtering gun to replace the                 
              thermal source.
