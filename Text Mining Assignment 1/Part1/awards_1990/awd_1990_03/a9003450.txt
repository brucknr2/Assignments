Abstract    :
                   This project focuses mathematical research on problems of                 
              dynamical systems.  In particular, work will be done on billiard               
              systems with polygonal boundaries.  One goal is to determine                   
              whether for all, or almost all, irrational right triangles, a                  
              generic symmetric orbit must be periodic.  Orbits which intersect              
              the boundary perpendicularly are called symmetric.  Work will                  
              also be done in examining rational periodic directions in                      
              rational triangles.  It is known that every rational periodic                  
              direction must be a multiple of a fixed value computed from the                
              three angles.  It is believed that a converse statement also                   
              holds, although not universally.  The proper conditions for a                  
              converse are still to be worked out.                                           
                   Other work will consider Furstenberg's correspondence and                 
              recurrence, minimal symbolic flows with linear block growth and                
              minimal flows arising from substitutions.
