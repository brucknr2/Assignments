Abstract    :
                   Professor Pincus will continue his investigation of currents              
              associated with the index structure of certain algebras of                     
              operators.  In particular he will study certain bundles and                    
              sheaves which are associated to the local index which he invented              
              as well as finer invariants.  He will also study the geometric                 
              meaning of the principal function, an extension of the index                   
              which is also defined on the essential spectrum.                               
                   Professor Pincus' research is in the general area of the                  
              theory of operators on Hilbert space. These operators are                      
              essentially infinite matrices of complex numbers.  Such                        
              operators or linear transformations have applications in every                 
              area of applied science as well as in pure mathematics.  This                  
              type of research is an attempt to classify certain important                   
              categories of such objects.
