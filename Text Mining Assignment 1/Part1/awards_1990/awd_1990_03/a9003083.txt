Abstract    :
                   This grant will fund an interdisciplinary conference on                   
              statistics and astronomy which will be held at The Pennsylvania                
              State University on August 11-14, 1991.  In recent years,                      
              astronomers have shown considerable interest in using advanced                 
              statistical techniques, such as survival analysis, sampling                    
              theory and spatial analysis.  However, not many statisticians are              
              aware of the problems in astronomy where statistics plays an                   
              important role, such as luminosity functions and nondetections,                
              galaxy clustering and image analysis.  This conference will                    
              bridge the gap between the two communities, exposing researchers               
              and students of the two communities to the common problems of the              
              two fields.  The sessions will begin with an invited review talk               
              by an astronomer describing the important data analysis problems               
              in an area.  These problems will be discussed by statisticians.                
              Particular data analysis problems and methods of solution will                 
              then be addressed in contributed presentations.
