Abstract    :
                   Professor Trow will conduct research in the area of symbolic              
              dynamics, a branch of dynamical systems.  His research will be                 
              primarily concerned with factor maps between shifts of finite                  
              type.  Factor maps are continuous, surjective, shift commuting                 
              maps.  They are the sliding-block codes of information theory.                 
              Professor Trow is interested in the question of existence of                   
              these maps, and their possible degrees.  These questions are                   
              closely related to topological conjugacy of shifts of finite                   
              type, the central problem of symbolic dynamics.                                
                   The objects of study in symbolic dynamics are sets (called                
              symbol spaces) whose elements are bi-infinite sequences of                     
              symbols, together with the shift map.  These spaces are natural                
              models for a large class of dynamical systems.  They are of                    
              great interest to ergodic theorists and information and coding                 
              experts.
