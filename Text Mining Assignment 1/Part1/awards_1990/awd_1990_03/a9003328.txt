Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The goal of this research is to improve the quality of bulk                    
              crystals by study and modification of the temperature field at the             
              crystal growth front.  A modified Czochralski process which will               
              incorporate a heater immersed in the melt just below the crystal               
              growth will be studied experimentally to obtain a flat growth-front            
              profile which is expected to provide bulk crystals with reduced                
              defects.  Primary studies at the PI's facility will be carried out             
              with NaNO3, and the information learned transferred to the growth              
              of other materials such as GaAs and InP, in collaboration with AT&T            
              Laboratories.
