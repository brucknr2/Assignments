Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The principal investigator will study construction of                     
              constant scalar curvature Kaehler manifolds of complex dimension               
              2 by two different methods.  The first of these involves a                     
              generalized Gibbon-Hawking ansatz, while the second uses the                   
              Banach space inverse function theorem applied to Kaehler                       
              potentials with point singularities of conormal type.  He will                 
              also study global deformations of complete non-compact Riemannian              
              manifolds with quaternionic holonomy.  Lastly, he will                         
              investigate the  global structure of the universal curve for                   
              Riemann surfaces with spin structure.                                          
                   In this project, the principal investigator will analyze                  
              complex manifolds which relate to twistor and string theory.                   
              These mathematical theories have been used to explain some of the              
              behavior of subatomic particles.  Manifolds are mathematical                   
              objects which include regular curves and surfaces as examples.                 
              Both of these examples are based on multiple copies of the real                
              numbers.  In this study, manifolds which are based on copies of                
              the complex numbers, instead of the real numbers, will be used to              
              analyze several questions arising from physics.
