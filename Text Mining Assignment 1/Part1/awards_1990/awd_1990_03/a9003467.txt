Abstract    :
                   The research involves the study of estimation in unbalanced               
              multivariate variance components models using an approach based                
              on a Fenchel duality formulation of the problem.  The effort                   
              will be concentrated in estimation and testing of covariance                   
              matrices in multivariate variance component models, relating the               
              results to appropriate fields of statistics, and studying rates                
              of convergence of the proposed algorithms. The multivariate                    
              random effects model involves constraints that the covariance                  
              matrices of the random effects be nonnegative definite which                   
              leads to a Lowner ordering of matrices. Algorithms will be                     
              investigated find to the restricted maximum likelihood estimators              
              of such matrices.
