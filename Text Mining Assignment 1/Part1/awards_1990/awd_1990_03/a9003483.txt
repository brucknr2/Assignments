Abstract    :
              Experiments to determine the compositions of pyroxenes in the                  
              assemblage enstatite + diopside + forsterite + anorthite will be               
              performed in the systems CaO-MgO-Al2O3-SiO at temperatures from                
              925oC to 1175oC, and pressures of 5000 and 7500 bars.  Results                 
              from these experiments will be combined with results obtained                  
              earlier in this experimental program at atmospheric pressure, and              
              at 2500 and 5000 bars.  The experimental data will be used to                  
              construct and to constrain empirical and thermodynamic models of               
              subsolidus pyroxene phase equilibria, which may then be applied                
              to methods of estimating temperatures and pressures of                         
              equilibration of felspathic, mafic and ultramafic rocks.                       
              Pyroxene compositions will be reversed, both in terms of Ca/Mg                 
              ratio and Al contents by approaching the equilibrium compositions              
              from starting compositions with both higher and lower values.                  
              Experiments will use vanadium pentoxide as a high-temperature                  
              solvent to promote grain growth and chemical equilibration;                    
              several lines of evidence developed earlier in this experimental               
              program demonstrate that this technique produces negligible                    
              effects upon the equilibria under investigation.  Analysis of                  
              compositions and phase assemblages will be performed                           
              petrographically, by electron microprobe, and powder X-ray                     
              diffraction, supplemented by scanning and transmission electron                
              microscopy and single crystal X-ray diffraction as required.
