Abstract    :
              This MCCP renewal aims at the incorporation of organic and                     
              organometallic molecules and polymer fragments in inorganic glass              
              matrices synthesized by the sol-gel method at low temperatures.                
              The main research goals include the use of the incorporated                    
              molecules as optical probes to characterize chemical changes                   
              which occur during sol-gel processing; synthesizing novel                      
              materials based on organic doping of inorganic solids; preparing               
              and optimizing materials and optical data storage media.  This                 
              work is part of the Materials Chemistry and Chemical Processing                
              Initiative, and it is jointly funded by the Chemistry Division                 
              and the Division of Materials Research.
