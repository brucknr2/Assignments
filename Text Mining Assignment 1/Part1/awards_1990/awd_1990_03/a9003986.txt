Abstract    :
              This grant will support theoretical research into the geometric                
              and control problems of grasping non-rigid and compliant                       
              objects.  Related control problems will also be studied, such as               
              task planning, non-holonomic motion planning, representation of                
              compliance uncertainty, and decomposition of tasks into                        
              homogeneous subtasks such as grasping, re-grasping, and finger                 
              gaiting.  The research is likely to integrate combinatorial                    
              task-planning algorithms with motion planning based on                         
              differentiable manifold theory.  Experimental verification of                  
              promising algorithms is also planned.
