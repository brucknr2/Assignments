Abstract    :
              This is a post Loma Prieta earthquake (Oct. 1989)                              
              investigation project in learning from this damaging                           
              event.                                                                         
                                                                                             
              This project concentrates on the seismic performance of                        
              elevators during the earthquake and relates this learning                      
              to the current elevator code requirement.                                      
                                                                                             
              A damage survey indicates that the Loma Prieta earthquake                      
              has caused extensive elevator damage, although the design                      
              details that contributed to the problems are not known.                        
              It is clear that seismic switches, optional in California                      
              but required for the National code, did not performed as                       
              intended.  This earthquake provides an opportunity to                          
              identify the deficiencies of current elevator codes and                        
              improve our understanding of the seismic performance of                        
              elevators.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              Several buildings that experienced elevator damages will                       
              be selected to represent a range of configurations,                            
              structural systems, types of elevator equipment, and                           
              locations.  A detailed inspection of elevators will be                         
              made based on damage details from expert interviews.  Code                     
              provisions will be evaluated in light of observed damage                       
              and changes suggested.  Finally, the malfunctions                              
              effecting the performance of seismic safety devices will                       
              be evaluated.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              This study will upgrade the current code requirements                          
              governing the seismic safety of elevator systems.
