Abstract    :
              Modern solid-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)                            
              spectroscopy offers the chemist one of the most powerful tools                 
              available for the study of the physical and chemical properties                
              of materials.  Fundamental knowledge of structure and dynamics                 
              of materials as diverse as biopolymers, resins, coals, and                     
              liquid crystals is accessible by solid-state NMR techniques.                   
              Solid-state NMR studies often complement those carried out                     
              using solution NMR and X-ray analysis.  Access to solid-state                  
              NMR is rapidly becoming essential to chemists carrying out                     
              frontier research.                                                             
                                                                                             
              This award from the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program                   
              and the Instrumentation for Materials Research Program will                    
              help the Department of Chemistry at the University of                          
              California in Santa Barbara, to acquire a high-field NMR                       
              spectrometer suitable for carrying out solid-state NMR studies.                
              The areas of chemical research that will be enhanced by the                    
              acquisition include the following:
