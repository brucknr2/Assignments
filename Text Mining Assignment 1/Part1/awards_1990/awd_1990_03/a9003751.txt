Abstract    :
              The genetic response to pH change will be investigated in                      
              Escherichia coli.  External pH is a major environmental parameter              
              for bacteria, and internal pH is significant in terms of                       
              bacterial physiology and energy transduction.  Two novel pH-                   
              regulated loci, isolated as lacZ operon fusions, will be studied:              
              ina inducible by membrane-permeable weak acids and protonophores,              
              and alx inducible by external base.  These loci will be cloned                 
              and sequenced, and their sequences analyzed for promoters and                  
              regulatory sites.  The possible regulatory role of acid-sensitive              
              sequences such as H-DNA will be investigated.  The pH dependence               
              of ina transcription will be tested in vitro.  Regulator genes                 
              for ina and alx will be isolated, by screening Tn10 pools for                  
              isolates which are either constitutive or uninducible.  Mutants                
              exhibiting defective pH homeostasis will be sought.
