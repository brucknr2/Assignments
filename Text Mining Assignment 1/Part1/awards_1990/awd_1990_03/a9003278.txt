Abstract    :
              To meet future needs for a convenient simulation                               
              environment with higher computing speed and large                              
              problem size, this Small Grant for Exploratory                                 
              Research (SGER) will combine a direct-executing                                
              language with a new low cost multi-processor                                   
              environment.  The multi-processor system is based on                           
              AT-type single-board computers.  This will:                                    
                                                                                             
              1. permit solution of large problems                                           
              2. increase execution speed with parallel processing,                          
                 and                                                                         
              3. give a group of graduate student new insight into                           
                 multi-processor hardware and software problems,                             
                 including dynamic model partitioning.
