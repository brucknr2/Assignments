Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research is funded under the National Science Foundation                  
              Small Grants for Exploratory Research Program.  The primary goal               
              of the research is to extend current aerosol deposition processes              
              and instrumentation to process thin films of silicon.  Thin films              
              of silicon powder are deposited on substrates such as silicon,                 
              tantalum, titanium, or silicon dioxide.  Effects of electrical                 
              charging of the powders, powder particle size, subsequent thermal              
              treatment of the deposit, are being studied.  The films are being              
              characterized using scanning electron microscopy, X-ray                        
              diffraction, and electrical property measurements.
