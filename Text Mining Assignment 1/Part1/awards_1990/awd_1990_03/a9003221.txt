Abstract    :
              In the vascular systems of the body (blood and lymphatic) it is                
              the smallest muscular vessels that play the greatest role in                   
              physiological regulation.  It has been extremely difficult in the              
              past to make quantitative studies of the behavior of these                     
              vessels because they are too small to allow the attachment of                  
              mechanical devices to measure their contractions.  It is possible              
              to measure their movement by computer image processing, but this               
              approach has not been exploited because of the previous high cost              
              of the equipment and the lack of suitable software.  Now that                  
              appropriate computer equipment is no longer prohibitively                      
              expensive, we will use a novel algorithm of our design to                      
              implement software that will (1) monitor diameter in several                   
              separate regions of a vascular tree and (2) monitor diameter                   
              change as a function of length along a region of a single vessel.              
              The algorithm we now use can be applied to vessels in isolated                 
              preparations that do not contain blood.  In response to our own                
              needs and to requests from other groups, we have developed                     
              another algorithm for vessels that contain blood, and we shall                 
              develop a second set of programs using this algorithm.  These                  
              systems will advance the technical capabilities in basic research              
              in the fields of blood and lymphatic microcirculation.
