Abstract    :
              Gel electrophoresis has been used to fractionate macromolecules for            
              studies in all fields of biochemistry and biophysics.  To                      
              understand mechanisms of sieving during gel electrophoresis, the               
              PIs have previously qualified sieving and tested several models of             
              sieving by gels.  Two models, one based on sterics and one and                 
              based on hydrodynamics, have survived these tests.  During previous            
              studies, sieving for spheres with radii between 5 and 500 nm has               
              been qualified; an analysis of the sieving of rods has been                    
              started; the structure of gels has been investigated.  The                     
              objectives of the present proposal are to: (1) determine the model             
              that most accurately describes the sieving of spheres during gel               
              electrophoresis; video light microscopy (phase contrast and                    
              fluorescent) of individual spheres undergoing gel electrophoresis              
              will be performed; (2) determine how sieving depends on the                    
              structure of the gel used for electrophoresis; sieving will be                 
              quantified by use of procedures of gel electrophoresis previously              
              developed by the PIs; the structure of gels will be determined in              
              part by use of electron microscopy and computer-assisted image                 
              processing; (3) determine the effect on sieving of the dimensions              
              and flexibility of rod-shaped particles; for this purpose, one of              
              the PIs' procedures of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis will be             
              used; (4) obtain and organize for rapid access a catalogue of                  
              conditions appropriate for sieving-based separation and                        
              characterization of particles with effective radii as small as 1-              
              2 nm and as large as 5-10 nm.  The research proposed will                      
              contribute to the understanding of motion through porous networks              
              in both biological  and non-biological systems.  This research will            
              also increase the capacity for rapid and inexpensive biophysical               
              characterization of particles that need not be purified.
