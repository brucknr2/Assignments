Abstract    :
                This research is to resurvey a Global Positioning System (GPS)               
              network measured by Caltrans in the Santa Cruz area to determine               
              coseismic surface displacements in the October 17, 1989, Loma                  
              Prieta, California, earthquake.  This data will be inverted along              
              with other geodetic data available in the region to determine a                
              coseismic slip model of the Loma Prieta earthquake.  GPS                       
              monitoring will continue on an approximately quarterly basis to                
              detect any post-seismic slip on the San Andreas or adjacent                    
              faults.  This research is a component of the National Earthquake               
              Hazard Reduction Program.
