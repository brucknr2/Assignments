Abstract    :
              This program involves experimental studies of the                              
              partitioning  of siderophile and other elements                                
              between lithophile phases and silicate melts at                                
              pressures varying from 1 bar to in excess of 200 kbars and                     
              temperatures varying from 1300oC to in excess of 2300oC.                       
              Knowledge of these  partition coefficients is essential to the                 
              interpretation of elemental systematics in the mantle and mantle-              
              derived materials and specifically bears on the question of the                
              early differentiation of the Earth.  These experiments also bear               
              directly on the thermodynamics and economic geology of the                     
              platinum group elements (PGE).                                                 
              During the next award period, the P.I.'s (i) continue ultrahigh                
              pressure experiments between olivine/melt, majorite/melt, and Mg-              
              perovskite/melt phase pairs, including ultrahigh pressure                      
              reversal experiments; (ii) continue the systematic study of noble              
              melt solubilities in silicate melts and partitioning between                   
              coexisting phases as functions of intensive variables; and (iii)               
              conduct experiments investigating the partitioning of Ga and Ge                
              between garnet/melt and clinopyroxene/melt pairs.  The results f               
              the experiments will be applied to understanding the early                     
              thermal history and differentiation of the Earth and to the                    
              thermodynamics and economic geology of the PGE.
