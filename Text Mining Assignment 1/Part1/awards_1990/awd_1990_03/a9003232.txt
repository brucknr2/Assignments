Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will support Professor Richard Fisher of the                        
              University of California at Santa Barbara in a research                        
              collaboration with Professors G. Orsi, G. Capaldi, and                         
              L. Civetta of the University of Naples.                                        
                                                                                             
              One of southern Europe's great cities, Naples, is                              
              located on a young (approximately 33,500 years), large                         
              volume (greater than 80 cubic kilometers) ignimbrite                           
              sheet resulting from a volcanic eruption.  This Campanian                      
              Ignimbrite (CI), occurs up to 100 km. from its probable                        
              source, having moved as an energetic pyroclastic flow                          
              across high mountain ridges.  The source of the CI is                          
              believed to be in the Phlegrean Fields, located in the                         
              Neapolitan suburbs.                                                            
                                                                                             
              The researchers intend (1) to establish chronology and                         
              chemical trends of the initial Campanian eruption that                         
              produced the first-deposited tephra and the ignimbrite                         
              sheet; (2) to determine the type of initiating eruption                        
              (pryoclastic and/or hydroclastic) and subsequent                               
              eruptive activity; and (3) to interpret flow mechanisms                        
              by studying the origin of the thin ground layer that                           
              occurs beneath the CI.  Detailed field and laboratory                          
              studies of this ignimbrite are necessary for the purpose                       
              of unraveling its history and what that portends for                           
              future activity.  If the CI originated from beneath the                        
              sea, it will be the first such ignimbrite to be                                
              documented, and it would be possible for the first time                        
              to characterize physical and chemical attributes of                            
              subaqueous ignimbrite and provide petrologic criteria                          
              for their recognition.
