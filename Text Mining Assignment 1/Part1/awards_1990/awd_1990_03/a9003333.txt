Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The principal investigator will study a method for showing                
              that all closed 3-manifolds with positive scalar curvature are                 
              obtained from spherical space forms by performing connected sums.              
              An analogous problem for 4-manifolds with positive isotropic                   
              curvature will be analyzed.  Other parts of the project include                
              investigations into the four-dimensional Schoenflies conjecture,               
              as well as studies of Kaehler and symplectic structures.                       
                   A closed curve on a sphere, which does not have any                       
              intermediate intersections, separates the plane into two disks.                
              Analogously, a properly smooth sphere lying in ordinary 3-space                
              bounds one ball, and bounds a second ball if infinity is                       
              collapsed to a point.  The principal investigator will study a                 
              method using heat flow to solve the analogous problem for three-               
              dimensional smooth spheres lying in four-dimensional space.
