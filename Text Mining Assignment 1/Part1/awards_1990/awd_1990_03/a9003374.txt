Abstract    :
                   This research is concerned with integral extensions of                    
              noncommutative rings. The principal investigator will determine                
              if an algebra, with a Hopf algebra action, is integral over the                
              invariant subring. He will also examine when a smash product is                
              integral over the coefficient ring. These results and                          
              techniques will be used to study the prime spectra of the rings                
              involved.                                                                      
                   This project is in the general area of ring theory. A ring                
              is an algebraic object having both an addition and a                           
              multiplication defined on it. These objects arise naturally in                 
              various branches of mathematics, physics and computer science.
