Abstract    :
              This is a post Loma Prieta earthquake (Oct. 1989)                              
              investigation project in learning from this damaging                           
              event.  The focus of this project is to study the effects                      
              of pounding of adjacent structures against each other                          
              based on the actual damage observations.                                       
                                                                                             
              The objectives are: (1) to survey the frequency and types                      
              of pounding that occurred, (2) to evaluate analytically                        
              the effects of pounding on several buildings that had                          
              observed structural damage from pounding, (3) to                               
              investigate the adverse effects of pounding, and (4) to                        
              provide engineers with guidance to mitigate  the damage                        
              from pounding.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              The expected research results:  a summary of observed                          
              damage due to pounding, and analytical investigation to                        
              correlate with actual observed pounding damage, a proposed                     
              modeling procedure and a design method for buildings                           
              subjected to pounding, and a method of mitigating pounding                     
              damage on existing adjacent buildings.                                         
                                                                                             
              This study will lead to a better understanding of the                          
              phenomena and proper ways to mitigate the damages in                           
              connection with pounding.
