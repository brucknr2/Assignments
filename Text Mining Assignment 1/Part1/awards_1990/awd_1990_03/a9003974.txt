Abstract    :
                   Professor Scott plans to work on conjectures in two specific              
              areas:  four conjectures related to the characterization of                    
              Seifert fiber spaces; and three conjectures which arise in the                 
              study of 3-manifolds of negative curvature.  His third area of                 
              interest is the subgroup separability of 3-manifold groups.                    
                   Manifolds of dimension three are among the most natural                   
              geometric objects for study by inhabitants of a three-dimensional              
              universe.
