Abstract    :
              This is a post Loma Prieta earthquake (Oct. 1989)                              
              investigation project in learning from this damaging                           
              event.                                                                         
                                                                                             
              This project addresses one specific problem - the                              
              effectiveness of steel bracing in strengthening existing                       
              buildings.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              Buildings strengthened with steel bracing will be                              
              selected to study the effectiveness of currently used                          
              philosophy and design procedures.  Improved methods will                       
              be developed for strengthening existing buildings by                           
              using steel bracing systems to enhance their safety                            
              during future earthquakes of greater "design level"                            
              intensities.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              Information resulting from this study will be useful for                       
              formulation of code requirements for evaluation and                            
              strengthening of existing buildings.
