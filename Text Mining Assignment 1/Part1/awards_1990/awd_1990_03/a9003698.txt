Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Theoretical studies will be conducted on random networks with                  
              particular emphasis on disordered superconductors and quantum                  
              systems.  The connection between percolation and                               
              superconductivity will be addressed for networks of Josephson                  
              junctions and for networks of thin wires governed by Ginzburg-                 
              Landau order parameters.  Also, studies will be conducted on the               
              random walk method for calculating transport properties such as                
              the Hall coefficient at the percolation threshold.
