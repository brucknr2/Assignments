Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The long term goals of this research project are two fold: (1)                 
              to obtain a concise description of how an ion channel system                   
              functions efficiently in an ion selective mode and (2) to                      
              develop experimental techniques and theoretical interpretations                
              that can be applied to the study of more complex biological                    
              transport systems in the future.                                               
              Multinuclei-multidimensional NMR spectroscopy, together with                   
              peptide synthesis will be used to study the effect of single                   
              amino acid substitution in the gramicidin transport system.                    
              The effect of this substitution on channel structure, on the                   
              integration of the gramicidin into a membrane, on channel                      
              formation, and on cation binding and transport will be observed                
              and characterized.
