Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The goal of this research program is to develop and refine an                  
              instrument for the study of epitaxial magnetic thin films.  Phase              
              transition measurements will be used to determine the critical                 
              exponents of the films.  This group is working to modify the                   
              physical properties of matter that affect the magnetic behavior                
              of materials through a study of the relation between atomic level              
              structure and magnetism.  The instrument being developed will                  
              combine two complementary spin-sensitive spectroscopic techniques              
              (Kerr effect and spin-polarized secondary electron emission) with              
              MBE and thin film structure analysis capabilities (spot-profile                
              analysis LEED and electron forward scattering spectroscopy).                   
              Scanning tunneling microscopy carried out on a separate system                 
              will be used to characterize the substrates.
