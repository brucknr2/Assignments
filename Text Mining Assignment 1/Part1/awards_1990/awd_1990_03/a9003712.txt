Abstract    :
              A detailed petrogenetic study of two major intrusive complexes                 
              within the Bays-of-Maine igneous complex:  the Pleasant bay                    
              layered gabbro and the Mt Desert Island igneous complex of                     
              gabbroic, dioritic and granitic rocks.  In both areas layers of                
              chilled to fine-grained gabbro and medium-grained diorite to                   
              granite occur intercalated with gabbroic cumulates.  Although                  
              these unusual layers have in the past been interpreted as dikes                
              or sills, field relations appear to be more  consistent with                   
              their interpretation as conformable layers deposited on a magma                
              chamber floor.  Field, petrographic, and geochemical studies will              
              be directed toward testing that thesis.
