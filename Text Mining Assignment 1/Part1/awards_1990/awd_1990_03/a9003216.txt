Abstract    :
                   Studies are proposed which center around the development and              
              testing of new model-based statistical procedures.  Included are               
              applied studies in social, biomedical and physical systems whose               
              analysis motivates certain new models and techniques that are                  
              tailored to practical problem-solving.  The models to be studied               
              gnerally have complex graphical structures, and the related                    
              inferences draw on several sources of statistical and expert                   
              knowledge.  The statistical techniques include Bayesian and                    
              belief function methods that are computationally intensive, thus               
              requiring algorithm development and are to be studied in part                  
              through assessment of numerical implementations.
