Abstract    :
                   This project will involve the study of singularities in the               
              theory of singular integrals and differentiation of integrals, on              
              the d-bar equation on domains of finite type in several complex                
              variables, and on dispersive nonlinear partial differential                    
              equations, with emphasis on applications of techniques from                    
              harmonic analysis and singular integrals.  The five major topics               
              to be studied are (1) the d-bar equation on domains of finite                  
              type in several complex variables, (2) singular maximal functions              
              and differentiation of integrals, (3) nonlinear dispersive                     
              partial differential equations, (4) singular integrals on sets                 
              and analytic capacity, and (5) a question in non-commutative                   
              ergodic theory.                                                                
                   The research in this project is aimed at the study of                     
              partial differential equations and the tools used in their                     
              analysis.  In particular, it involves the applications of the                  
              ideas of harmonic analysis to problems in several complex                      
              variables and nonlinear dispersive equations.
