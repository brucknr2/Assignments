Abstract    :
                   In this award the principal investigator will study a new                 
              class of inverse problems called inverse nodal problems.  The                  
              motivation for this study is the question concerning how much one              
              can say about a vibrating membrane if one knows the nodal lines.               
              The nodal lines are the curves along which the eigenfunctions of               
              the membrane vanish.  In one dimension the nodal lines are points              
              (nodes).  Nodes are of interest in engineering applications                    
              because they represent the optimal locations for the support of a              
              mast or placement of a bearing on a shaft, while nodal lines                   
              enter into the analysis of flaws in holographic plates.                        
                   What can you say about a vibrating string if you know the                 
              nodes or a vibrating membrane if you know the nodal lines?  Nodal              
              lines are the fixed curves or points on the standing waves                     
              generated during the vibration.  This is an example of an inverse              
              problem:  one attempts to determine an object or process from the              
              data it produces.  Such inverse problems have important                        
              engineering applications and the principal investigator will                   
              employ analytical and numerical methods to study the                           
              discontinuous problems and the uniqueness of the density.
