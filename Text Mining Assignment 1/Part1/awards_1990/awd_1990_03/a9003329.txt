Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research in analytic number theory                
              of Professor Daniel Goldston of San Jose State University. Dr.                 
              Goldston's project involves a study of the fine details in the                 
              pattern of distribution of prime numbers. He plans to examine the              
              Hardy-Littlewood circle method and its application to the study                
              of small gaps between primes and the exceptional sets for the                  
              Goldbach conjecture; the Riemann zeta function as a tool for                   
              studying large gaps between primes; Maier's method and                         
              differential delay questions; and connections of these methods                 
              with the emerging understanding of the duality between primes and              
              zeros of zeta functions.                                                       
                   The field of analytic number theory applies to the discrete               
              realm of the whole numbers the techniques of analysis, dependent               
              on the notions of continuity and limit, originating in calculus.               
              The idea of using continuous methods to investigate the discrete               
              is two centuries old, but with the work of the modern analytic                 
              number theorists such as Professor Goldston, the field has had a               
              new rebirth.
