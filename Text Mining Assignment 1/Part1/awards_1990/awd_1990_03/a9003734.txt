Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              In previous research it was established that non-living algal                  
              biomass immobilized in polymer beads effectively absorbs or                    
              binds a number of toxic metal ions from polluted process                       
              effluents.  It is proposed to continue this investigation by:                  
              1) continuing, the screening of algal genera or species for                    
              metal ion removal and recovery potential; 2) secondarily,                      
              extending the screening for metal ion binding to other cells,                  
              particularly, higher plant cells; and 3) extending primary                     
              efforts to identify the specific functional groups on the                      
              algal cell walls that permit metal ion binding.  New                           
              investigation results will provide valuable insight into the                   
              application of algal polymers to the removal and the recovery                  
              of particular toxic, precious, and strategic metal ions from                   
              polluted-, geothermal-, and mining-water, and from industrial                  
              process streams.
