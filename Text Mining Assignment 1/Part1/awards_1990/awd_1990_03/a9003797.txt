Abstract    :
              In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program                 
              of the Chemistry Division, Professor Baer will design and carry                
              out experiments in the infrared region of the spectrum to                      
              measure the rates with which loosely bound clusters of atoms                   
              and ions come apart.  The ultraviolet region of the spectrum                   
              will be used to probe the behavior of more complex organic                     
              compounds containing oxygen and nitrogen.                                      
                                                                                             
              The high resolution infrared spectroscopy and dissociation                     
              rates of loosely bound ionic clusters will be investigated by                  
              IR photodissociation of mass selected cluster beams.  The ion                  
              lifetimes will be measured in real time.  The Rydberg                          
              spectroscopy of oxygen and nitrogen containing ring compounds                  
              will be investigated by resonance enhanced multiphoton                         
              ionization to explore the origin of the spectral sensitivity to                
              a molecule's stereochemistry.
