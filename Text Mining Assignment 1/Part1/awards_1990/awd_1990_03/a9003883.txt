Abstract    :
              Declamination is one of the most common failure modes                          
              of composite materials.  It occurrence may be due to                           
              either imperfections in the production process or the                          
              effect of external factors during the operational life of the                  
              composite laminates, e.g. impact by foreign objects.  The                      
              presence of declamination can reduce the buckling load                         
              of the composite leading to global structural failure at                       
              loads below the design level.                                                  
                                                                                             
              This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) deals                         
              with the development of two computational approaches                           
              to solve the moving boundary problem, i.e. the dynamics                        
              of the growth of a thin strip declamination in a thick                         
              based laminate.  The governing equation is a nonlinear                         
              integro-differential equation where the unknown length                         
              of delaminated strip appears not only in the boundary-                         
              condition but also in the equation of motion.
