Abstract    :
              This research is concerned with the application of various                     
              diffusing-wave-spectroscopic probes to the study of the dynamics               
              of dense colloidal suspensions.  Light scattering experiments                  
              will be carried out on well controlled particles suspensions.                  
              The primary aim of the work is to explore basic scientific issues              
              connected with:  1) the dynamics and structure of strongly                     
              interacting, dense colloidal suspensions, and 2) the transport of              
              light dense random media.  The secondary goals concern advancing               
              diffusing-wave-spectroscopic measurement technology and attempts               
              to apply the technique to more complex systems.  It is                         
              anticipated the research will improve our understanding of the                 
              roles played by hydrodynamic and electrostatic interactions in                 
              affecting particle dynamics and structure.
