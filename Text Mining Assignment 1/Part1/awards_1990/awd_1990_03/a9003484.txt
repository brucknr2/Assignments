Abstract    :
                   Mathematical and statistical methods will be developed to                 
              analyze and interpret DNA sequences from different individuals of              
              the same species.  The goal of the research is to use such data                
              to achieve a greater understanding of processes governing genetic              
              evolution, particularly mutation, recombination, gene conversion               
              and gene flow.  The methods developed will take advantage of the               
              detailed information provided by within-species DNA sequence                   
              data.  Particular attention will be paid to the phylogenetic                   
              relationships of genes as indicated by their sequences.  The                   
              overall approach of the research will be to combine simple                     
              analytic models of simple problems with computer simulation                    
              models of more complex and realistic problems.  The methods                    
              developed will be applied to available data.  The plan is to                   
              spend one semester in Richard Lewontin's laboratory and Harvard                
              University learning more about what kinds of data are available                
              and working with Lewontin and his collaborators on the analysis                
              of their data.   //
