Abstract    :
                 Yeast provides an excellent system for the study of Golgi                   
              secretory function because of its tractability to genetic,                     
              molecular, biochemical, and cell biological analyses.  This                    
              project focuses on the role of SEC14p, the protein gene product                
              of the SEC14 gene identified previously as being required for                  
              normal yeast secretory activity.  Prior work under NSF support                 
              has shown that SEC14p is a cytosolic protein, which somehow                    
              is required for export of proteins from the lumen of the                       
              Golgi.  Also, extragenic suppressors of sec14-ts have been                     
              characterized.  The long-term goal of the project is to                        
              understand, at the molecular level, how the secretory process                  
              functions. The specific aim of the proposed research is to                     
              identify and characterize the specific membrane compartment of                 
              the Golgi apparatus which is involved in the function of SEC14p.               
              This study will involve enrichment of the compartment from                     
              temperature-sensitive sec14 mutants by biochemical means, and                  
              immuno-identification of these compartments using antibodies                   
              against various gene products known (from genetic analyses) to be              
              involved in SEC14p function.                                                   
                                                                                             
              The function of the Golgi in the secretory process is an                       
              important question relevant to several disciplines of the life                 
              sciences.  These studies will make an important contribution to                
              this area of research.
