Abstract    :
              This award will provide support for Juan Redondo, who is a                     
              postdoc at the University of Michigan working with Professor Jeff              
              Rauch.  Dr. Redondo plans to continue his study of the regularity              
              of free boundaries in the solutions of parabolic variational                   
              inequalities like the ones associated with the classical Stefan                
              problem.  He is also going to investigate the regularity of shock              
              wave solutions of hyperbolic conservation laws by applying his                 
              variational techniques to the parabolic systems that come from                 
              adding viscous terms to the original hyperbolic systems.                       
              Nonlinear partial differential equations describe many                         
              dissipative phenomena like the flow of heat.  If the amount of                 
              dissipation is small the solutions of such equations often behave              
              as if there is no dissipation at all. In this grant the postdoc,               
              Juan Redondo, will use techniques from variational theory that                 
              exploit this relationship between dissipative and non-dissipative              
              systems in order to study things like the shape of a boundary                  
              between different materials and the sharpness of a front between               
              gases of different densities.
