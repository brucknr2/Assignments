Abstract    :
                   This project treats algebraic (and analytic) actions on                   
              affine varieties from the viewpoint of smooth (differentiable)                 
              transformation groups.  The subject of smooth transformation                   
              groups has been strongly influenced by the following two central               
              problems:  LINEARITY PROBLEM.  Which groups act nonlinearly on                 
              affine space of some dimension?  (An action is linear if it is                 
              conjugate to an action defined by a representation of the group.)              
              FIXED POINT PROBLEM.  Which groups act without fixed points on                 
              affine space of some dimension?  The tools used to settle these                
              problems and the further problems they generated have been                     
              important themes in the field of smooth transformation groups.                 
              During the last few years researchers from algebraic                           
              transformation groups as well as those from smooth transformation              
              groups have recognized the importance of these two questions in                
              the algebraic category, and in that case the groups dealt with                 
              should be reductive (which includes as a special case the finite               
              groups).  Petrie will continue his work in this direction,                     
              bringing topological methods to bear on algebraic questions.
