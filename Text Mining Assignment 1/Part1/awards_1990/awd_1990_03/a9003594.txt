Abstract    :
              This is a post Loma Prieta earthquake (Oct. 1989)                              
              investigation project in learning from this damaging                           
              event.                                                                         
                                                                                             
              This projects will study the damage and document the                           
              museum contents losses during the earthquake in terms of                       
              both value and failure mode.                                                   
                                                                                             
              Several critical museums will be selected and their site-                      
              specific art object/support system response criteria will                      
              be determined from the recorded ground motions.  The                           
              response criteria and damage survey will then be used to                       
              develop recommendations for future seismic loss mitigation                     
                                                                                             
              measures for museum contents.                                                  
                                                                                             
              This study will improve our ability to reduce the losses                       
              of museums in their irreplaceable collections due to                           
              earthquakes.
