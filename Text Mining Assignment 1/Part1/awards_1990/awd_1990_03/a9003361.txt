Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Two investigators will study Kleinian groups and Teichmuller              
              spaces.  One will analyze deformation spaces and cohomology of                 
              Kleinian groups, moduli of Riemann surfaces and their explicit                 
              representations, automorphic forms, and projective structures.                 
              The second will continue his investigation into the structure of               
              Kleinian groups and hyperbolic 3-orbifolds emphasizing the                     
              classification of geometrically finite groups and combination                  
              theorems.                                                                      
                   The two investigators will work toward solving several                    
              problems related to the study of Kleinian groups.  An example of               
              such a group would be a collection of motions of the plane which               
              preserve a periodic tiling.  As elements of a group these must                 
              satisfy several axioms including one which requires the existence              
              of an inverse element associated with each element of the group.               
              If one element translates the plane by two units to the "right,"               
              its inverse element would translate the plane two units to the                 
              "left."  The study of such motions has led mathematicians to the               
              solutions of problems involving crystal structures.
