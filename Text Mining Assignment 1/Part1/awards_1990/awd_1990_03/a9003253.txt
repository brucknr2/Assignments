Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is the study of algorithms and                   
              complexity, focusing on specific application areas and methodologies.          
              This project is aimed to further our understanding of local search and         
              some other important computational problems whose answers are                  
              guaranteed to exist.  The research involves development of rigorous            
              techniques for attacking various computational problems with an                
              "artificial intelligence" flavor, such as prehension and exploration           
              by robots, and probabilistic logic, a complexity-based understanding           
              of certain aspects of Economic Theory and Game Theory, and study of            
              problems in security and communication in very large networks, and             
              certain novel optimization problems related to communication networks.
