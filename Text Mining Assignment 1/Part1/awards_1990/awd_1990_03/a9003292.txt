Abstract    :
              Testing sequential logic circuits and systems is the research subject.         
              Solutions to this problem usually require costs that are, for many             
              applications, too formidable to allow wide adoption.  The goal is to           
              find low cost techniques that reduce overhead of time, area and test           
              data volume while maintaining high fault coverage.  The approach is to         
              use the notions of partial scan and partial BIST, which show promise in        
              testing sequential circuits.  One research thrust is to develop new            
              measures of testability and a new criteria for scan element selection.         
              A second is to systematically avoid elements of existing techniques that       
              contribute to high costs.  Effective test algorithms are being developed       
              by using scan elements derived from information about the actual test          
              generator.  Substantial empirical evaluation with experimental tools           
              using real circuits is being done.
