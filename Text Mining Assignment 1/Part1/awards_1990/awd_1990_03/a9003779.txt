Abstract    :
              This is a post Loma Prieta earthquake (Oct. 1989)                              
              investigation project in learning from this damaging event.                    
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
              The goal of this project is to improve the seismic design                      
              of structures through a better understanding of seismic                        
              input and the inelastic structural response.                                   
                                                                                             
              The database of the recorded building response will be used                    
              to:  (1) evaluate the damage potential of recorded ground                      
              motion, (2) collect building and freeway structure details                     
              and recorded response, (3) develop analytical models and                       
              perform time-history analysis, (4) estimate damage                             
              potential, and (5) generate inelastic design response                          
              spectrum.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              The study will produce recommendations on the values for                       
              design ductility and the yield resistant seismic                               
              coefficient to be used in design practice.
