Abstract    :
              This award supports a workshop which would address the                         
              application of the Global Positioning System (GPS) to earth                    
              science problems in Antarctica.  With advances in technology                   
              it is now possible to address real-time changes in the                         
              morphology of the earth that results from processes such as                    
              tectonism (mountain building, earthquakes activity) and the                    
              growth or decay of the earth's major ice sheets.  Such                         
              studies will be most important in bringing Antarctica into                     
              the mainstream of global earth-science research.                               
                                                                                             
              The workshop will:  1) identify and develop the scientific                     
              objectives for a coordinated campaign, 2) identify the                         
              technical needs associated with such a campaign and 3) draw                    
              up a plan for a possible campaign.
