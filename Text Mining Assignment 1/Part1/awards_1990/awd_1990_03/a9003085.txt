Abstract    :
              With this postdoctoral fellowship, Dr. Hay will be working with                
              Professor Michael Radnor and Professor Wallace J. Hopp of                      
              Northwestern University in order to examine the origins,                       
              development and diffusion of operations research (OR) from 1940-               
              1960.  OR is a mathematical approach to complex problem solving                
              created during World War II.  A study of Allied scientific-military            
              cooperation in developing and employing OR reveals its military                
              importance.  The postwar era (to 1960) shows how OR methods were               
              extended to create mathematical programming, game theory, and other            
              cornerstones of decision science.  Dr. Hay will examine this                   
              postwar technology transfer from solely military use to private and            
              public enterprize.   He will employ American and British government            
              archives, memoirs, official histories, other relevant monographs               
              and articles.  He will also interview key surviving OR                         
              practitioners.
