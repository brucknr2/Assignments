Abstract    :
                   This proposal concerns an extention of the lossless Lempel-Ziv            
              data compression algorithm to lossy algorithm using a rate-                    
              distortion type of fidelity criterion.  The project will focus on              
              three problems first, all related to data compression algorithm and            
              estimation algorithms based on log convex functions:                           
              Identificattion of Log-Convex Parameters.  Extension of Rissanen's             
              Approach to the Estimation Problem.  An Extimation Algorithm                   
              Motivated by the Lempel-Ziv Data Compression Algorithm.  If                    
              possible, other work on data compression algorithms based on the               
              Lempel-Ziv algorithm and modifications will be extended.//
