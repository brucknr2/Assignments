Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The principal investigator will study the dynamics of                     
              polynomials of C^2, quadratic differentials, and iteration                     
              schemes used in numerical analysis.  In doing so he will exploit               
              two analogies.  The first of these is the similarities between                 
              the dynamical behavior of polynomial diffeomorphisms of C^2 and                
              that of maps of C.  The second of these is the similarities                    
              between these same polynomials and Axiom A diffeomorphism.                     
                   In recent years exquisite fractals have been generated by                 
              computer iteration of polynomial and rational maps of the complex              
              plane.  Of course, each of these were functions of a single                    
              complex variable.   The principal investigator will extend this                
              theory to include iteration of functions of two complex                        
              variables.
