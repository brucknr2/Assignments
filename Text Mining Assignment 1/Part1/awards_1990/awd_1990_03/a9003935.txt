Abstract    :
                   In the eastern portion of the Western Gneiss region of the                
              central Norwegian Caledonides a sequence of cover and                          
              structurally higher units have been intricately infolded with                  
              basement gneisses.  The regional interference patterns have                    
              previously been explained as the combined result of gneiss dome                
              and basin formation, recumbent folding and late cross-folding.                 
              Recent mapping however shows that the patterns can be                          
              reinterpreted as a refolded sequence of three highly                           
              noncylindrical recumbent nappes with a sheath-like form.  This                 
              project will test the possibility that very large sheath folds,                
              on the order of 30 kilometers in wavelength, occur in this                     
              orogen.  Results are applicable to other deep-seated orogens                   
              where large crystalline thrust sheets have moved long distances.
