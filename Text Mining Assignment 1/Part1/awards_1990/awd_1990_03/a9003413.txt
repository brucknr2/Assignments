Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              The American Federation of Information Processing Societies is                 
              conducting a Workshop on Computational Science for Faculty of                  
              Undergraduate Institutions without doctoral programs at the                    
              University of North Carolina, Asheville, during the week of                    
              August 6 through August 12, 1990.  Sixteen well qualified                      
              individuals have offered to help in the organizing, planning                   
              and conduct of the Workshop.  Approximately 30 participants                    
              will be selected.  Of these 30 participants, at least 20 will                  
              come from those schools which traditionally accommodate                        
              undergraduates from populations under-represented in the                       
              mathematical and physical sciences.                                            
                                                                                             
              The objective of the Workshop is to assist the faculty members                 
              to enhance their curricula and attract students to courses in                  
              sciences such as computer science, mathematics, physics and                    
              chemistry.  During the one week of the Workshop, it is intended                
              to illustrate a generic model of a one semester course on                      
              "Introductory Computational Science".  This will be                            
              accomplished by lectures, demonstrations, video presentations                  
              and hands-on experiences using IBM personal computers, Apple                   
              Macintosh computers and remote supercomputers.
