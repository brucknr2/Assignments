Abstract    :
                   It is widely recognized that fabrics preserved in natural                 
              tectonites record a portion of the strain history and the                      
              physical conditions surrounding the deformation.  Full use of                  
              fabric data, however, is prevented by the uncertainty in the                   
              relationships that may exist between the fabric, the grain-scale               
              deformation processes and the rock's mechanical behavior.  This                
              project will develop methods to add capability of making stress-               
              strain measurements to previously developed techniques using low               
              melting- point analog materials that are able to follow                        
              development of fabrics microscopically.  The addition will                     
              facilitate application of synkinematic microscopy methods to                   
              problems of deep-earthquake source mechanisms, growth of minerals              
              during deformation and an assessment of how much of the                        
              microstructure in natural tectonites represents the                            
              microstructure present during deformation.
