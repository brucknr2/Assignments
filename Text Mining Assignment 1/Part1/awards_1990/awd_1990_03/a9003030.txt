Abstract    :
              With the increased use of automated reasoning systems and the                  
              proliferation of parallel machines, the need for research in parallel          
              automated reasoning was never more evident.  Coarse grain parallel             
              theorem provers have been developed which demonstrate linear speed-up          
              for small to medium scale problems; however, fine grain provers for            
              very large scale problems have yet to be developed.  In this work a            
              SIMD parallel automated reasoning system will be designed based upon           
              the clause graph (or connection graph) model.  This system will be             
              implemented on the Connection Machine model CM-2 and will be applied           
              to a number of problems in group theory and combinatorial geometry.            
              In addition, parallel algorithms will be developed for computing and           
              analyzing the spectra of clause graphs.
