Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              This is an innovative award.  The objective is to determine                    
              the feasibility of using H-shaped fiber glass reinforced                       
              plastic as the reinforcement for a concrete beam. The                          
              potential benefit would be the elimination of corrosion which                  
              takes place on the conventional steel, thus increasing the                     
              life span of concrete structures.
