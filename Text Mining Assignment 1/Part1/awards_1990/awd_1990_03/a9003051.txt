Abstract    :
                This research is centered on two objectives.  One goal is focused on         
              the synthesis and study of new types of metal-thiolate complexes as            
              models for metal-sulfur centers in proteins.  Specific systems include         
              analogs for the ?Fe(SR)4!1- center in rubredoxins2- the ?Fe4S4(SR)4!1-         
              center in high potential iron-sulfur proteins, the ?Fe3S4(SR))3!2-             
              center in 3Fe-sulfur proteins, and the ?Ni(III)(SR)n! center in                
              hydrogenases.  Another goal is to explore new research directions in           
              the area of metal-oxide compounds as analogs for relevant metal-oxide          
              centers in biology as well as in the industrially important metal-             
              oxide supported catalyst.  The reaction chemistry of new types of              
              ligands will be explored.  Specifically, compounds that are apt to             
              mimic the iron- or manganese-oxide centers in hemerythrin,                     
              ribonucleotide reductase, methane monooxygenase and Photosystem II             
              will be investigated.  This research is being pursued with the                 
              prospect of obtaining fundamental information about the structural,            
              spectroscopic and reactivity properties of these metal centers in              
              nature.                                                                        
                The interactive activities include numerous lectures in graduate             
              chemistry courses, and putting together an industrial scientist-               
              graduate student seminar, directed at enhancing the graduate students'         
              awareness of career opportunities in the chemical industry.                    
                This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to                
              provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in                    
              engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and (2)         
              to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering by             
              providing greater visibility for women scientists and engineers                
              employed in industry, government, and academic institutions.  By               
              encouraging the participation of women in science, it is a valuable            
              investment in the Nation's future scientific vitality.
