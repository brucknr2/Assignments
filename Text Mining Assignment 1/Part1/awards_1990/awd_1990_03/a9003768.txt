Abstract    :
              The genesis of potassic igneous rocks and the evolution of the                 
              subcontinental mantle will be investigated by studying the                     
              potassic, mafic rocks at Two Buttes, Colorado, the easternmost                 
              Cenozoic igneous intrusives in the western U.S.  These rocks are               
              at an extreme geographic position, have unusual compositions, and              
              appear to be above a thick continental root.  Field studies will               
              be completed, ages will be determined, and petrographic, electron              
              probe, major and trace element, and isotopic analyses will be                  
              made.  Major and trace element and Nd and Sr isotope abundances                
              will be compared with those of rocks in contrasting tectonic                   
              settings to test theories for magma genesis, for metasomatism of               
              continental lithosphere, and for relationships between melt                    
              generation and subduction.  Pyroxene textures resemble those                   
              ascribed to magma mixing, and isotopic as well as chemical                     
              studies will be used to investigate the importance of the process              
              in producing the diverse rock types at Two Buttes and elsewhere.
