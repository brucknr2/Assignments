Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Dr. Backer's research covers a range of studies in the general                 
              field of pulsar astrophysics.  There are two principal foci:  the              
              development of new hardware for searching for pulsars with fast                
              periods; and surveys to discover other interesting objects in                  
              this class.  A set of these pulsars will be monitored as                       
              celestial clocks for precision experiments.                                    
                                                                                             
              Pulsars with millisecond periods and binary pulsars probably form              
              a distinct class of neutron stars that have rotational periods                 
              which are processed by angular momentum transfer from a companion              
              star.  The solitary millisecond pulsars have an uncertain past,                
              but may fit the binary scenario if evaporation of a companion can              
              proceed to completion.  Dr. Backer's research is involved in both              
              finding new members of this class of pulsars, and in using                     
              millisecond pulsars as celestial clocks for precision                          
              measurements.
