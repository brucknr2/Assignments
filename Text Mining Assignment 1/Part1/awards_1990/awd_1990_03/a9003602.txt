Abstract    :
              This is a post Loma Prieta earthquake (Oct. 1989)                              
              investigation project in learning from this damaging                           
              event.                                                                         
                                                                                             
              The thrust of this project is to evaluate the performance                      
              of university buildings located at the campus of the                           
              University of California at San Francisco (UCSF) from the                      
              damage observations and seismic behavior analysis.                             
                                                                                             
              The UCSF campus has gradually grown over the years to now                      
              encompass 80 buildings located throughout San Francisco.                       
              As such the campus exhibits a wide range of building                           
              types and standards and, in addition, strong motion                            
              records are available for this site from the California                        
              Division of Mines and Geology, thus making it ideally                          
              suited for this evaluation.                                                    
                                                                                             
              Several buildings of different types will be chosen for                        
              detailed evaluations.  Evaluation methods from the                             
              Applied Technology Council ATC-14 document will be                             
              employed to perform consistent, realistic, cost effective                      
              assessments of the performance during the Loma Prieta                          
              earthquake of the existing buildings against their                             
              standards of record.  Observed damage, causes of any                           
              failures, likely building responses, actual and potential                      
              life-safety hazards, and capacity/demand margins for the                       
              Loma Prieta and future earthquakes with respect to UCSF                        
              buildings will be identified and discussed.  These                             
              findings will be extended to behavior of university                            
              buildings in general with respect to their standard code                       
              of record in a final report to be issued at project                            
              completion.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              The building stock of a variety of construction types and                      
              ages will enable the seismic performance of older                              
              buildings be evaluated and the associated generic                              
              potential life-safety hazards be rectified.
