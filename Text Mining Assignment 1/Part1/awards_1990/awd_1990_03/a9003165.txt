Abstract    :
              Theories of defeasible reasoning previously developed and                      
              supported will be further investigated.  Expansion will include                
              networks with expressive enhancements such as:  nets with limited              
              cyclicity; Boolean combinations of nodes in nets; study of                     
              arguments which interfere with a given argument by disabling                   
              inferences leading to a particular conclusion; hydra inheritance;              
              higher order links; semantic foundations for defeasible                        
              inheritance; and additional work on roles and relations.  This is              
              basic research on reasoning focusing on inheritance and having                 
              significance in non-monotonic methods.
