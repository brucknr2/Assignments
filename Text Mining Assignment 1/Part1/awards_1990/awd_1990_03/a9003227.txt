Abstract    :
                   This proposal concerns itself with several problems                       
              involving random media, namely the propagation of pulse waves and              
              the focussing of singularities of solutions of the nonlinear                   
              Schroedinger equation.  In particular, the principal investigator              
              will study direct and inverse problems for pulse reflection of                 
              waves in random media, reflection and transmission of gravity                  
              waves in irregular channels, and singular solutions of the                     
              Schroedinger equation due to nonlinear focussing of light beams.               
              Such problems arise in a host of areas, for example, seismology,               
              plasma physics and nonlinear optics.                                           
                   Many phenomena involve the propagation of waves through                   
              inhomogeneous media.  Think of seismic waves travelling inside                 
              the earth after an earthquake.  Since the medium is not uniform                
              or orderly, we call it random and scientists use a variety of                  
              mathematical models to help understand how local microscopic                   
              properties influence macroscopic ones.  The macroscopic effects                
              are the the ones we can measure and they usually are of most                   
              interest to us.  In this proposal the principal investigator will              
              use analytical and numerical tools to study how waves and light                
              beams behave as they travel inside of random media.//
