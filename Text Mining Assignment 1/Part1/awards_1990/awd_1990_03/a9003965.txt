Abstract    :
                   Modeling, analysis, simulation and computation                            
              involving physical phenomena have been important for many years                
              in the fluid dynamics.                                                         
                   This research activity will focus on vortex sheet                         
              computations, fast iterative solvers for transport equations, and              
              nonlinear systems of hyperbolic conservation laws.
