Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research in combinatorics of                      
              Professor Jeffry Kahn of Rutgers University. Dr. Kahn will be                  
              conducting investigations in the following topics: the properties              
              of hypergraphs (collections of finite sets); the problem of                    
              giving a good estimate of the probability that a random square                 
              matrix of order n, in which all entries are zero or 1, should be               
              singular; and Chvatal's conjecture on intersecting families in                 
              ideals in finite Boolean algebras.                                             
                   This research falls in the broad category of combinatorics,               
              which is one of the most active fields in today's mathematics.                 
              Fundamentally, combinatorics represents a systematization of the               
              very first of all mathematical activities, counting. In its                    
              modern development, however, combinatorics has gone beyond just                
              counting to make use of a wide variety of advanced mathematical                
              techniques, and although its roots go back several centuries, the              
              field has had an explosive development in the past few decades                 
              because of its importance in communications and information                    
              technology.
