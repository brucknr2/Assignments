Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              In the last few years, there has been an increased interest in                 
              the study of multilevel preconditioners for solving elliptic                   
              problems in conjunction with the conjugate gradient method.  Part              
              of the motivation is that these methods are highly                             
              parallelizable, in addition to usually possessing good                         
              convergence properties, a combination that most of the classical               
              preconditioners (e.g. SSOR, incomplete factorizations and                      
              polynomial preconditioners) lack.  The authors' previous work in               
              this area has convinced them that this is a very promising                     
              approach for constructing efficient and robust iterative methods               
              for solving large elliptic difference equations on massively                   
              parallel computers.  Continued research in this area, will                     
              include a careful study of implementation issues for massively                 
              parallel computers such as the CM.2, a theoretical study of the                
              relationships among different multilevel preconditioners and the               
              class of domain decomposition methods, hybrid multilevel methods               
              which retain the nice properties of incomplete factorization                   
              methods with respect to non.smooth coefficients, and extensions                
              beyond self-adjoint second order elliptic operators                            
              (e.g.indefinite, convection-diffusion and biharmonic operators.)
