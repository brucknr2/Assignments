Abstract    :
                This research is to determine and analyze surface deformation                
              patterns due to landsliding and tectonic deformations associated               
              with the October 17, 1989, Loma Prieta earthquake in California.               
              The tectonic deformation fields will then be interpreted in terms              
              of stresses and displacements computed from theoretical models of              
              faulting.  This research is a contribution to the National                     
              Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
