Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This Gordon Research Conference on the Chemical Senses will                    
              provide a forum for experts in the field to informally discuss                 
              the latest data and concepts that are emerging in focused target               
              areas of high current interest.  Each discussion session will                  
              include ample time for open active interchange after each                      
              presentation by a speaker.  The free exchange of ideas at these                
              conferences has traditionally been a large factor in their                     
              stimulation of the field to push at the frontiers.  This                       
              conference will have impact on areas of cellular and behavioral                
              neuroscience extending beyond simply chemosensory science.
