Abstract    :
                   This award provides one-half the funding required for the                 
              purchase and installation of a spinner magnetometer to be                      
              operated in the Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at                
              Saint Louis University. The University is committed to providing               
              the remaining funds needed.                                                    
                   The magnetometer will be used in paleomagnetic research in                
              the areas of oceanic crust magnetization, basic rock magnetism,                
              and pre-Cambrian and Paleozoic paleomagnetism.
