Abstract    :
                   This research, in the area of automorphic forms, makes use                
              of theta-liftings for the construction of automorphic forms                    
              related to the representation theory of groups over local fields.              
              Although scholars in local representation theory have obtained                 
              deep results about lifting general classes of unitary                          
              representations, the applications to automorphic forms have often              
              been restricted to lifting one-dimensional characters.  This                   
              research involves a specific and important case of the global                  
              lifting problem and success should provide guidance for more                   
              general work in the future.                                                    
                   This research bridges both Modern Analysis and Algebra and                
              Number Theory and concerns the representation theory of classical              
              groups together with automorphic forms on classical groups.
