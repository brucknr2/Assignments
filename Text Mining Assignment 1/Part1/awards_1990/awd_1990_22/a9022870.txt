Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                 This research focuses on a new technology, the "Queue                      
              Inference Engine" (QIE), which is a set of statistical                         
              procedures that allows one to infer with precision the                         
              performance of many important queues (waiting lines) without                   
              ever observing them.  Using only transactional data --                         
              service initiation and completion times -- all of the key                      
              performance measures for Poisson arrival queueing systems                      
              can be obtained.  Under NSF SBIR Phase I funding, substantial                  
              research progress was made, building on the original QIE                       
              mathematics developed by Dr. Richard C. Larson at the                          
              Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and addressing                          
              research problems likely to occur in practical implementation                  
              settings.                                                                      
                   The OIE has proven to be a uniquely accurate and                          
              unobtrusive tool for measuring near real-time queue behavior                   
              in a variety of settings.  The research will be carried out                    
              cooperatively with two major U.S. service organizations and                    
              is designed to evolve an installable prototype OIE that is                     
              relatively "bulletproof" in typical application settings.                      
              Using a sequence of three empirical methods involving a                        
              combination of analyses of videotaped observations and Monte                   
              Carlo simulations, Q.E.D. will examine light traffic                           
              situations, inter-service time gaps, heavy traffic congestion                  
              periods and sensor-based data augmentation.
