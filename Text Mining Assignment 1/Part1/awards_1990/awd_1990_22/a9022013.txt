Abstract    :
                   Research will focus on establishing the genetic basis of the              
              between lake morphological differences in Bluegill populations.                
              Larvae from in vitro crosses made with the Canadian study                      
              populations will be transported to "common garden" ponds at the                
              University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.  These genetically marked                   
              individuals (with mtDNA and isozyme markers) will be reared in                 
              vegetated and open water habitats and their morphological                      
              development will be measured.  This study will demonstrate                     
              unambiguously whether the inter-lake components of morphological               
              divergence are due to underlying genetic variation or the result               
              of environmental induction of phenotype working on a common,                   
              plastic genotype.
