Abstract    :
              In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of              
              the Chemistry Division, laser- and microwave-based molecular beam              
              spectroscopic techniques will be used (1) to obtain rotational                 
              constants, hyperfine constants, and permanent electric dipole                  
              moments of transition metal clusters of Sc, Ag, and Pt and their               
              hydrides and carbides; (2) to study the predissociation of CH; and             
              (3) to study the vibronic problem in MgOH by measuring the proton              
              magnetic hyperfine constants.  The first study provides tests for              
              ab initio calculations, while the second is a way of examining the             
              nature of two states which become mixed in an avoided crossing.                
              Since the states differ in their electronic character, the Stark               
              shifts provide some information which can be used to deduce the                
              mixing set of levels.  In the third problem the observed constants             
              can provide information about the potential energy surface shape.

              The goal of this research is to simplify optical spectra in order              
              to study the dynamics and structure of very short-lived                        
              (transient) gas phase species.  The chemical bonding in some very              
              fundamental chemical species containing transition metals will be              
              investigated.  An understanding of such bonding is important in                
              surface science and inorganic chemistry, and has implications for              
              catalysis.
