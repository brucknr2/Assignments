Abstract    :
              Professor Kingsland is examining the careers of three important                
              but relatively neglected American botanists of the early                       
              twentieth century:  Daniel T. MacDougal, a physiological                       
              ecologist;  George H. Shull, a geneticist; and Edward M. East, a               
              geneticist.  All three were pioneers in the development of                     
              experimental approaches to evolutionary biology and in the                     
              formation of the disciplines of ecology and genetics.  Though                  
              located at different institutions, their research overlapped in                
              several ways.  With this grant, Professor Kingsland is exploring               
              the relationship between "pure" and "applied" science by studying              
              the economic and institutional context of their work, especially               
              the applications of their research to environmental management                 
              and agriculture.  She is also considering the role of the private              
              patron (the Carnegie Institution) in influencing the direction of              
              research at the turn of the century.  She is using these case                  
              studies to bring into clearer focus the agricultural and                       
              entrepreneurial context of American experimental biology in the                
              early twentieth century.  In so doing, they can also help us to                
              understand the form and character of modern American science.
