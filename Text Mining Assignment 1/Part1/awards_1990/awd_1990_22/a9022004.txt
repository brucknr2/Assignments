Abstract    :
                   The Pacific Exploratory MIssion-West (PEM-WEST) is an                     
              international program aimed at understanding tropospheric ozone                
              production and nitrogen oxide and hydrocarbon pre-cursors                      
              downstream of a major anthropogenic source region.  This mission               
              will be conducted in the western Pacific region during the                     
              summer/fall of 1991.  Both ground-based and aircraft platforms                 
              are expected to make important scientific contributions.  The                  
              longer temporal scale of the ground-based measurements will                    
              complement the short term, greater areal coverage of the aircraft              
              measurements.                                                                  
                   The PI proposes to conduct measurements of NO and NOy at one              
              of the PEM-WEST intensive ground based stations for a period of                
              six weeks.  These measurements are proposed to contribute to the               
              overall mission objectives to evaluate ozone photochemical                     
              production and loss rates as a function of altitude and                        
              geographic position, to examine transport fluxes and identify                  
              Asian source regions of advected ozone and ozone precursors, and               
              to conduct model studies of OH mixing ratios over the western                  
              Pacific from observations of O3, CH4, CO, NOx, and NMHC.
