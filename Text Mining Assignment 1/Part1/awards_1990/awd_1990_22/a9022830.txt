Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project conducts an experimental investigation of the                     
              effects of program trading in stock indices on the volatility of               
              stock prices and on the informational efficiency of stock                      
              markets.  In addition, it determines how these effects vary with               
              the rules which govern trade in the markets.  The research is                  
              conducted in a sequence of experimental markets.  The initial                  
              studies examine volatility and efficiency in a market with                     
              multiple stocks but without any derivative securities.  The                    
              project then introduces stock index futures.  Finally, program                 
              traders are introduced.  These studies are conducted in both the               
              standard double auction market and also in an open outcry market.              
                                                                                             
              Experimental analysis of program trading is important and timely.              
              Currently, at least four major exchanges (including the New York               
              Stock Exchange and the Chicago Board of Options Exchange) are                  
              investigating the role of program trading.  The issues of concern              
              seem ideally suited to an experimental analysis.  The controlled               
              conditions allow precise measurement of the way program trading                
              affects the price volatility and informational efficiency of                   
              experimental markets.  The research should also enhance our                    
              understanding of the role of trading rules in the effects of                   
              program trading.
