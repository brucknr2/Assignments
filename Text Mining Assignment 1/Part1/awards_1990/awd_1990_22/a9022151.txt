Abstract    :
              Chemists carrying out frontier research are relying more and                   
              more on computers that are capable of handling sophisticated                   
              simulations, data analysis and graphics software.  The need to                 
              accomodate multiple users on the single laboratory computer and                
              multiple users on a single chemistry department facility can be                
              met by a single solution:  individual work stations for the                    
              majority of user needs and, for the remainder, ready access to                 
              other types of work stations and, ultimately, to a mini                        
              supercomputer.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              This award from the Chemistry Shared Research Instrumentation                  
              Program will help the Department of Chemistry at the University                
              of Colorado at Boulder to acquire, maintain and operate a                      
              graphics computer system.  The areas of chemical research that                 
              will be enhanced by the acquisition include:
