Abstract    :
              This proposal has the goal of developing a microscopic                         
              understanding of the underlying physical processes for particle                
              emission for semiconductor and insulator surfaces when surfaces are            
              irradiated with a low flux pulsed UV laser beam.  The emphasis will            
              be focused on understanidng the role of surface defects in the                 
              particle emission process.  New techniques for monitoring the                  
              possible surface structural changes of the topmost surface layer               
              associated with the particle emission process will be developed.               
              One such technique, ion scattering spectroscopy which has extreme              
              surface sensitivity and can yield information not available by                 
              optical methods, will be explored.  An attempt will be made to                 
              verify the correctness of two pending models (used for                         
              understanding silicon and germanium results) and to point to new               
              directions that will enable the understanding of the underlying                
              physical mechanisms.  A possible application that might result is              
              a means of quantifying the surface defect density by using defect-             
              initiated particle emission.  This work is complementary to the                
              study of particle emission from metal surfaces.
