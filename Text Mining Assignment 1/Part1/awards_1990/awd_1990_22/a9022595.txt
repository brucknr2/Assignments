Abstract    :
                   This grant supports the research of Dr. D. Chudnovsky and                 
              Dr. G. Chudnovsky as principal investigators.  They intend to study            
              approximations to functions and numbers with a view to revealing               
              arithmetic properties of classical constants.  They intend to use              
              Pade approximations in conjunction with isomonodromy deformation               
              equations.                                                                     
                   This is research in the field of number theory.  Number                   
              theory starts with the whole numbers and questions such as the                 
              divisibility of one whole number by another.  It is among the                  
              oldest fields of mathematics and it was originally pursued for                 
              purely aesthetic reasons.  However, within the last half century,              
              it has become an essential tool in developing new algorithms for               
              computer science and new error correcting codes for electronics.
