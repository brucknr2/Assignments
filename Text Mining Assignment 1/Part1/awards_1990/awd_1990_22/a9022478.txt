Abstract    :
                This will focus on the application of learning techniques for                
              planning and scheduling problems.  The meeting will bring together             
              active researchers in machine learning, planning, and scheduling to            
              exchange ideas and reports recent progress.  The meeting will be               
              held in Palo Alto, California, during January 1991, and the speaker            
              will be well-known researcher in these three areas.  The symposium             
              will contribute to communication and cooperation amoung researchers            
              in the different fields, and will advance our understanding of the             
              role that learning can play in planning and scheduling systems.
