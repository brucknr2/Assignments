Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Phototransduction is the process whereby light energy is                       
              converted into an electrical signal in the photoreceptor                       
              membrane.  The goal of this research project is to gain insight                
              into the mechanisms that underlie phototransduction in the                     
              photoreceptor cells of the eye.  Photoreceptor cells, isolated                 
              from the eye of the fruitfly, Drosophila, will be used as a model              
              system, since the phototransduction process in the fly retina is               
              similar to that in the vertebrate retina, including those of                   
              mammals.  When light strikes the eye, a cascade of biochemical                 
              events occur within the photoreceptor cells.  At the endpoint of               
              the cascade, an unknown intracellular messenger molecule causes                
              "light-sensitive" ion channels in the photoreceptor membrane to                
              open.  The opening of the ion channels causes the cell membrane                
              to undergo a change in its electrical potential which is                       
              responsible for the transmission of visual information to the                  
              brain.  The study will focus on the role of ion channels in the                
              phototransduction process and identify the intracellular                       
              messenger molecule which activates and modulates the activity of               
              light sensitive channels.  Experiments utilizing the                           
              electrophysiological technique of patching clamping will be used               
              to examine the role of ion channels in this process.  This                     
              technique will permit the Principal investigator to examine the                
              function of all channels in the membrane acting in unison or                   
              examine single channels isolated in small membrane patches.                    
              Results gained from these studies will aid in understanding the                
              function and regulation of ion channels involved in the visual                 
              system.
