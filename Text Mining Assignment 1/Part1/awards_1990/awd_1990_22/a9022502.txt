Abstract    :
              A general purpose, numerical simulation and modeling software                  
              package program for the analysis of dynamics systems by biologists             
              and biomedical scientists, will be developed.  The software program            
              will be applied to new areas of biological research and serve to               
              train experimental scientists in the use of mathematical hypotheses            
              and simulations.  Commercial GUIs (graphical-user-interface),                  
              including  MS-DOS Window will be used and the kernel of the program            
              will be established separately so it can run on a UNIX machine.                
              The GUI for a UNIX RISC-type workstation will also be established.             
              Smalltalk/V will be used for prototyping, using C++ concurrently               
              under MS-DOS and UNIX Windows.
