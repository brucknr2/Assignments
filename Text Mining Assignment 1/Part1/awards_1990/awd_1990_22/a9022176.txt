Abstract    :
              Testing for structural change and parameter instability has a long             
              history in econometrics and statistics. Parameters are frequently              
              reduced forms of unobservables, such as taste, technology and                  
              institutions. Although it may be reasonable to believe that these              
              unobservables have been roughly constant over the sample period,               
              it is rarely a priori obvious and should therefore be subject to               
              a specification test. Despite the long history of study of this                
              problem, most researchers apply simple sample split tests or                   
              forecast error tests, neither of which are optimal. The purpose of             
              this project is to develop a powerful test for parameter                       
              instability  calculated under the null hypothesis of constant                  
              parameters which is easy to calculate, even in non-linear contexts.            
              The approach taken is to use an approximate Lagrange Multiplier                
              test against the alternative that the parameter is martingale. This            
              includes simple structural breaks as well as random walks. The                 
              asymptotic distribution is non-standard, but invariant to nuisance             
              parameters if the regressors are non-trended. Appropriate                      
              asymptotic theory is developed, which makes use of some recent                 
              developments in stochastic process theory.
