Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Understanding the role of circulating fluids in controlling                    
              sedimentary properties along convergent margins has become a high              
              priority research objective in the marine geosciences.  In a                   
              number of areas the discharging fluid can be sampled directly and              
              inferences made about the depth of circulation, interaction with               
              surrounding sediments, and degree of modification of sedimentary               
              physical parameters.  Sampling of sea-floor sediments and                      
              subsequent analysis can allow the history of circulation systems               
              to be examined.                                                                
                                                                                             
              This award will support an examination of the petrography and                  
              geochemistry of carbonate sediments that have been deposited by                
              circulating fluids along the Oregon margin.  Samples will be                   
              recovered by submersible in September of 1990.  Samples will be                
              analyzed for their major element chemistry and isotope                         
              composition.
