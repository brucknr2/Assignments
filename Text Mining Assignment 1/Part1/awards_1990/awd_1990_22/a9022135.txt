Abstract    :
              This research, supported by the Analytical and Surface                         
              Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division, will study the                    
              fundamental chemistry of alumina-supported catalysts.  Such                    
              catalysts are commonly used in the petroleum and petrochemical                 
              industries, but are not well understood.  By studying the                      
              details of the surface chemistry of the catalysts,                             
              understanding leading to optimization of catalytic efficiency                  
              and specificity will be obtained.  In turn, optimization of                    
              industrial processing with such catalysts may be anticipated.                  
                                                                                             
              %%%                                                                            
                                                                                             
              This research, supported by the Analytical and Surface                         
              Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division, will employ                       
              Electron Spectroscopy for Chemical Analysis (ESCA) to                          
              characterize the surface oxidation state of alumina-supported                  
              chromium catalysts, and then correlate oxidation state with                    
              reactivity.  Means of easily depositing well-defined thin                      
              layers of known oxidation state will also be pursued.  By                      
              correlating catalytic activity with surface structure and                      
              oxidation state, control of catalytic activity will be sought.                 
              Raman spectroscopy and X-ray Absorption Fine Structure                         
              measurements will also be employed.
