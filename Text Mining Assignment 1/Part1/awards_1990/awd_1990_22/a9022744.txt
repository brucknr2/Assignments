Abstract    :
                   This award establishes a USA Study Group formulated to                    
              investigate engineering research and education issues related to               
              manufacturing industries.  In conjunction with a similar group                 
              funded by the Foundation for Research Development in South Africa,             
              the interaction of the two groups will allow for a sharing of past             
              experiences and visions for the future.  The exchange focuses on               
              human resources development issues, including programs designed to             
              increase the number of educated engineers from population segments             
              that traditionally do not select technologically oriented careers.             
              Two-week visits in each other's country includes stops at                      
              representative educational institutions and the holding of focused             
              workshops to develop reports identifying areas of possible further             
              interactions.
