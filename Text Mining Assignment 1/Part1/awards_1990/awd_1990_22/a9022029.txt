Abstract    :
                   The International Working Group on Taxonomic Databases for                
              Plant Sciences (also known as TDWG) has been a unique force in                 
              developing data standards for botanical information.  Their                    
              efforts have produced the ability to move data among many                      
              participating computer installations.  At an upcoming TDWG                     
              meeting in Delphi, Greece, an international assemblage of                      
              botanists, information specialists, and computer scientists will               
              collaborate on a design for a global information system for the                
              plant sciences.  They will draft an action plan and                            
              specifications for efforts that will extend over the next decade               
              and potentially span all countries of the world.                               
                   Access to information on plants, their geographic                         
              distribution, and their ecology and taxonomy is critical to many               
              fields.  Biologists, land use planners, political economists, and              
              even the military have long-term needs for accurate data                       
              concerning plants.  Except for the efforts of TDWG, most of the                
              energy expended on botanical data have been at the level of                    
              single institutions, such as an herbarium, botanical garden, or                
              agriculture department within a university.  The Delphi symposium              
              will capitalize on these efforts, and set a productive new course              
              for global collaboration.
