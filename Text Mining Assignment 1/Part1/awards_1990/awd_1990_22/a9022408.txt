Abstract    :
              The central equatorial Pacific (EQPAC) is a very large region of               
              overall high primary productivity that exhibits distinct                       
              latitudinal gradients in the flux of organic material from                     
              surface waters to the seafloor.  A problem in modeling global                  
              carbon budgets is that the rate of organic-carbon mineralization               
              at the seafloor in this region is not directly related to surface              
              productivity.  Therefore, a better understanding is needed of the              
              processes controlling the destruction of organic matter falling                
              from surface waters.  In this regard, it is critical to study                  
              the role of sedimentary microorganisms, especially bacteria.                   
                                                                                             
              This project will sample the microbiological communities on a                  
              USJGOFS EQPAC cruise in  1992. The study will employ a                         
              multifaceted approach will be used in order to address four                    
              hypotheses concerned with the effects of changes in carbon flux                
              to the benthic environment on: 1) sedimentary microbial biomass;               
              2) the functional-group composition of the microbial community;                
              3) bacterial utilization of carbon (glutamic acid); 4) the growth              
              rate and productivity of the microbial community.  An ultimate                 
              goal of this project is to combine these microbiological data                  
              with those generated by other EQPAC researchers and to determine               
              the role of bacteria in the mineralization and formation of                    
              organic matter in these oceanic sediments.
