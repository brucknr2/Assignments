Abstract    :
                   The PI will continue studies on the processes that control the            
              stratigraphy of sedimentary basins, including tectonics,                       
              sedimentation and climate.  The combination of data analysis and               
              modeling provide insight to the evolution of process rates and                 
              dominance in the relation between stratigraphic sequence and                   
              surface phenomena.  Application of this research area to foreland              
              basins is particularly important to continental history.
