Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              The 13C and 14C composition of dissolved inorganic carbon will be              
              measured in the equatorial Pacific Ocean during two U.S. JGOFS                 
              cruises in Spring and Fall 1992.  The objective of the research                
              is to estimate the rates of new production in the equatorial                   
              pacific and determine the effects of CO2 gas exchange, upwelling               
              and biological production of surface ocean CO2 levels.
