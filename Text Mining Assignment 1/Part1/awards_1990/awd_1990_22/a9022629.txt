Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award funds continuing studies of one of the worlds leading               
              groups of theoretical cosmologists.   Wroking at the interfaces of             
              particle physics, nuclear physics, and astrophysics, these                     
              investigations will refine our understanding of light element                  
              evolution, big bang nucleosynthesis, supernova neutrino physics                
              and the interplay of early and late stage particle physics phase               
              transitions with galaxy and structure formation and the dark matter            
              problem.
