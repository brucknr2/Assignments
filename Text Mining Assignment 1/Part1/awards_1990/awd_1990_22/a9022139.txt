Abstract    :
                   This project will study stochastic optimization from the point            
              of view of recursive algorithms with improved convergence speed,               
              asymptotic properties of identification procedures for distributed             
              parameter systems, algorithms for adaptive filtering and nearly                
              optimal controls for differential delay systems with wideband                  
              noise.                                                                         
                   An attractive and easily implementable stochastic                         
              approximation algorithm will be analyzed under correlated noise                
              processes.  The idea is to take the average of the iterates                    
              obtained in                                                                    
              the classical approximation approach without using "prewhitening".             
              Dealing with the identification algorithms for distributed systems,            
              a functional invariance approach will be taken.  The resulting                 
              properties will help to get a better understanding on the rate of              
              convergence issue.  In the adaptive filtering problem, algorithms              
              with delays and projection procedures using "sign" will be                     
              investigated.  Sufficient conditions for with probability one                  
              convergence will be derived.  Nearly optimal controls for                      
              differential delay equations subject to random perturbations and               
              with a small parameter will be developed by means of weak                      
              convergence methods and the use of relaxed controls.                           
                   Applications of these studies are found in areas ranging from             
              the analysis of financial markets to the construction of more                  
              precise software for radars.
