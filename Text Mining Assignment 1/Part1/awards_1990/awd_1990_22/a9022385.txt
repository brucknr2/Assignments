Abstract    :
                   It is planned to provide tools for interpretation of                      
              combined hard X-ray, soft X-ray, and optical observations of                   
              solar flares by developing self-consistent models of energy                    
              transport in flares.  The MAX '91 program is providing                         
              unprecedented multiwavelength observations of flares during the                
              current solar maximum.  In particular, it is planned to compute a              
              grid of physically self-consistent atmospheric models which are                
              in energy balance, including energy transport by nonthermal                    
              particles, thermal conduction, and all important radiation                     
              processes (X-ray, UV, optical).  It is neither necessary or                    
              desireable to carry out a fully time-dependent model.  It is more              
              useful, for interpretation of the observations to consider two                 
              simpler limiting cases:  the hydrostatic limit, valid on                       
              timescales typically tens of seconds or longer, and the impulsive              
              limit, where the mass is frozen into its preflare distribution.                
              To determine the heating and cooling of the optically thick                    
              chromosphere, a rigorous non-LTE treatment of the radiative                    
              transfer and statistical equilibrium in all important atomic                   
              lines will be employed.  These models should provide an important              
              step toward using integrated multi-wavelength observations to                  
              discriminate between thermal and nonthermal processes in solar                 
              flare chromospheres.
