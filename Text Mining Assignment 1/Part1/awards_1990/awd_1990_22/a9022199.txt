Abstract    :
              Development of commercial-scale plants using circulating                       
              fluidized bed (CFB) combustion has been hindered by a lack of                  
              understanding concerning the basic mechanisms of heat                          
              transfer.  This work concentrates on the heat transfer from                    
              particles in contact with the wall of the bed, an important                    
              and poorly understood component of heat transfer in CFB's.                     
              The parameters controlling the heat transfer process are being                 
              measured in an existing 20 cm CFB test facility using a                        
              particle sensor and capacitance probe for various different                    
              particles and fluidization conditions and related to the bed                   
              hydrodynamics.  The heat transfer coefficient will be                          
              predicted and compared to actual heat transfer measurements.                   
              This work will produce an increased understanding of the link                  
              between heat transfer and hydrodynamics in CFB's, and aid the                  
              design of heat transfer surfaces in CFB combustors.
