Abstract    :
              This research is to develop a model to describe the time                       
              course of regional myocardial activity after a localized                       
              lesion of the heart muscle.  The innovative feature of                         
              the model is that it uses energy balance to consider                           
              myocardial function, and it takes into account the time                        
              varying and highly nonlinear nature of the system.  The                        
              research should result in an improved engineering                              
              methodology to describe myocardial ischemia, and it may                        
              also lead to new techniques for controlling                                    
              cardiovascular assist devices.
