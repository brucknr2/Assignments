Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Stochastic Analysis will be utilized in order to further                  
              understand questions such as utility maximization in incomplete                
              markets, equilibrium prices in a consumption based capital asset               
              pricing model, optimal portfolios, consumption optimization, and               
              transaction costs.                                                             
                   This project should result in technical formulations leading              
              to a more scientific management of financial decisions.
