Abstract    :
              This project will assess the technical feasibility of                          
              rehabilitating an in-site pipeline by extruding a molten                       
              thermoplastic tube into the existing pipe and successfully heating             
              and cooling the tube to form an attached liner, thus sealing all               
              leaks.
