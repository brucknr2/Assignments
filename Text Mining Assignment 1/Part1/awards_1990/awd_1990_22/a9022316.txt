Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              The research will contribute to the U.S. JGOFS studies of the                  
              central equatorial Pacific through the determination of the                    
              settling particulate flux.  The proposal combines "core"                       
              research and "process-oriented" research involving temporal                    
              variations in composition and flux of particles across an                      
              equatorial transect at 140oW.  The core part of the proposed                   
              research will deploy sediment trap moorings across the                         
              equatorial transect and determine the concentration of some key                
              components in the settling particle flux.  These studies will                  
              define the relationships among sediment burial, carbon flux,                   
              and productivity in different biological systems and help                      
              define the oceanic response to major climatic change.  This                    
              process-oriented science will use trace elements in selected                   
              sediment trap samples to establish proxies for productivity.                   
              By combining sediment trap sample analyses with sediment                       
              analyses, the P.I.'s will evaluate variations in particle flux                 
              from event scale to glacial-interglacial scales.  They will                    
              also use trace element data to evaluate the eolian flux across                 
              the equatorial Pacific, the seasonal pattern of this input, and                
              its relationship to biological productivity.  This part of the                 
              research will contribute to the important question of                          
              micronutrient metals as limitations on oceanic productivity.
