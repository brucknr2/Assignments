Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project supports a cultural anthropology student                          
              investigating the role of values in the career choices of nurses               
              in the Chicago area.  The project will investigate how female                  
              student and professional nurses conceptualize and talk about                   
              their values and relate their values to their reasons for                      
              entering, remaining in, and leaving nursing.  Using the methods                
              of intensive interviewing and textual analysis of transcripts,                 
              the student will use computer text management programs to                      
              identify and analyze key concepts and terms relating values to                 
              career choices.                                                                
                                                                                             
              This research is important because the relation between values                 
              and decisions is assumed to be direct and important, in that                   
              decisions flow directly from values.  Research using powerful                  
              computer methods of analysis such as used here can help reveal                 
              the structure of the relationship and help understand job                      
              satisfaction in general, and help identify ways to make nursing a              
              more attractive profession in particular.
