Abstract    :
              This award will support a six-month research visit by Professor                
              John B. Van Zytveld of the Department of Physics, Calvin College               
              in the laboratory of Professor H. Endo, Department of Physics,                 
              Kyoto University.  They will measure the optical properties of the             
              liquid alloys MgBi and MgSb in the concentration regimes in which              
              the alloys become less metallic and more semimetallic or semicondu-            
              cting.  They will obtain this information by means of optical                  
              reflectivity measurements at normal incidence in the photon                    
              energy range from 0.5 eV to 5.2 eV.  This study should provide                 
              valuable information about the electronic structure of these                   
              alloys.
