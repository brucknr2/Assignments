Abstract    :
                   This proposal will continue three more years of the work                   
                  currently supported by Cooperative Agreement ATM-8714335.                  
                  The research involves radar observations at the Jicamarca                  
                  Radio Observatory, which is located near Lima, Peru, and                   
                  will be conducted by Cornell scientists and students,                      
                  resident staff members of the Observatory, and visiting                    
                  scientists and students from other institutions in the                     
                  United States and other countries.  This Cooperative                       
                  Agreement provides the main financial support for the                      
                  Observatory.  The topics to be investigated include: (1) the               
                  energetics and dynamics of the equatorial F region and                     
                  protonosphere, (2) plasma instabilities in the equatorial E                
                  and F regions, (3) mesospheric and stratospheric dynamics                  
                  and energy transfer processes, and (4) changes in the                      
                  geomagnetic field.***//
