Abstract    :
              This is a Phase II SBIR award on the topic of relief                           
              of energy transfer limitations in electric power                               
              networks.  The results of Phase I of this award                                
              demonstrated the feasibility of using specially defined                        
              "voltage zones" as a basis for on-line tracking of                             
              transmission constraints relative to current system                            
              conditions.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              In phase II, the Phase I results will be confirmed and                         
              extended in the context of a realistic, large scale,                           
              system model.  The new methodology will be reduced                             
              to an algorithmic form suitable for on-line                                    
              implementation.
