Abstract    :
                   A broad program of research on the basic physics of atoms,                
              ions, and simple molecules and their interaction with                          
              electromagnetic radiation is carried out.  New methods of using                
              lasers and coherent light sources in spectroscopy are explored.                
              These methods are used in a range of applications including tests              
              of the validity of fundamental symmetries of nature, stringent                 
              tests of quantum electrodynamics, the spectroscopy of sharp                    
              special features in metals, and the manipulation of DNA with                   
              lasers.
