Abstract    :
              The purpose of this research is to analyze the link between the                
              volatility in national output and productive efficiency.  The                  
              first part of the project will focus on developing a theoretical               
              general-equilibrium-model in which output volatility leads to                  
              lower economic growth.  It has already been established that in a              
              static setting that if firms must commit to technology, then                   
              higher variability in the economy can lead to lower output.  This              
              important result will be extended to a growth situation by                     
              formulating a model of endogenous growth with learning-by-doing.               
              Support for the theoretical results will be provided by expanding              
              on the preliminary empirical work which shows a strong negative                
              relationship between the average and variance of real GNP growth.              
                                                                                             
              The second part of the project involves an empirical                           
              investigation of the theoretical models developed in part one,                 
              which will focus on a detailed study of plant-level data in the                
              U.S. automobile industry.  The data set, which has already been                
              collected, contains detailed weekly plant-level data for                       
              approximately fifty assembly plants for the period 1972 to 1983.               
              These data will be used to estimate the form of the cost function              
              in order to understand the effect of output volatility on                      
              productive efficiency.                                                         
                                                                                             
              This research is important because understanding the relationship              
              between the characteristics of technology and output volatility                
              remains central to the study of economic fluctuations.  It is not              
              clear for example whether firms dampen underlying volatility or                
              magnify it.  Also, it is very unclear as to what aspects of                    
              technology lead to such behavior and how output volatility                     
              affects productivity of the firm.
