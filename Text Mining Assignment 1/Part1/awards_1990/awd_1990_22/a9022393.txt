Abstract    :
              This Phase II SBIR proposal is to continue efforts to                          
              develop thin coatings for implantable device cables.  The                      
              emphasis is on using a plasma enhanced deposition process                      
              to produce a coating of fluorinated parylene, an                               
              insulator.  The research will optimize the deposition                          
              process and will test biocompatibility using in vitro                          
              experiments.  If successful, the research will result in                       
              improved implantable cables.  This is potentially                              
              important because a deteriorating cable is one of the                          
              most common causes of failure of implanted electronic                          
              devices.
