Abstract    :
              This is a proposal for the first U.S.-Taiwan joint workshop on                 
              photosynthesis.  This workshop is organized by Dr. Richard                     
              Dilley, Purdue University and Dr. R. L. Pan, National Tsing                    
              Hua University supported by the AIT-CCNAA Cooperative Science                  
              Program.  The Cellular Biochemistry Program of the Division                    
              of Cellular Biosciences has contributed $2,000 to support                      
              this joint workshop.  This workshop covers topics important to                 
              understand photosynthetic processes and provides an opportunity                
              for scientists to exchange and to advance the research in                      
              this field.  It provides a forum to plan future research                       
              programs related to photosynthesis study in the subtropic                      
              island region of Asia and will increase cooperative research                   
              activities in this field between US and Taiwan scientists.
