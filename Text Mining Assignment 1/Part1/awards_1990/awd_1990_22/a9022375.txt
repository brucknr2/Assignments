Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              This study will characterize relationships between remotely                    
              sensed ocean color and the vertical profiles of bio-optical                    
              variables and primary productivity - and their interannual and                 
              seasonal variabilities - to address central goals of the U.S.                  
              JGOFS Equatorial Pacific Plan.  It is hypothesized that                        
              photoadaptation by phytoplankton creates vertical profiles of                  
              pigments and optical profiles which, in a given geographic                     
              province and time of year, are predictable functions of near-                  
              surface optical properties estimable from remotely sensed ocean                
              color.  It is further speculated that the joint profiles of                    
              natural and stimulated fluorescence and optical properties are                 
              photoadaptive characteristics which may correlate with primary                 
              productivity.  Optical and fluorescence (natural and                           
              stimulated) measurements will be acquired during the JGOFS                     
              EqPac cruises, which in combination with core measurements of                  
              pigments and productivity, will be used to develop empirical                   
              models of these relationships.  These results will enable                      
              pigment biomass and productivity analyses of past (CZCS) and                   
              future (SeaWiFS) ocean color data, as well as contributing to                  
              the assessment of regional biogeochemical processes in the                     
              context of the overall JGOFS EqPac data set.
