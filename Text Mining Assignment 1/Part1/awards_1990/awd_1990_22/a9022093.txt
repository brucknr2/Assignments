Abstract    :
                   Physical measurement techniques and physics principles are                
              applied to investigating and understanding the functioning of                  
              musical instruments.  These investigations provide improved                    
              understanding of vibrating systems in general, sound production                
              and control, wave propagation in irregular spaces, computer                    
              modeling, and non-linear mechanics.
