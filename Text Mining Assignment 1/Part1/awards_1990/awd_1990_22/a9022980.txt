Abstract    :
              This award from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic                
              Program of the Chemistry Division will support an annual                       
              workshop in organometallic chemistry.  The participants will be                
              organometallic chemists from academia, industry, and private                   
              and government research organizations.  The goals of the                       
              workshop are to facilitate communication among researchers in                  
              the different kinds of organizations and to foster the exchange                
              of new ideas much earlier than is possible through formal                      
              publications.  The format of the workshop is designed to                       
              encourage maximum participation by all attendees, and the plan                 
              for selecting attendees will ensure broadly based                              
              participation.  The topics to be discussed will span a broad                   
              spectrum from synthesis of new organometallic compounds to the                 
              utilization of such compounds as catalysts or as precursors for                
              making new materials.
