Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The Materials Research Laboratory (MRL) at the Massachusetts              
              Institute of Technology supports a broad range of interactive and              
              interdisciplinary materials research in four primary thrust                    
              areas.  Research on transition metal oxides addresses                          
              high-temperature superconducting materials and mechanisms,                     
              focussing primarily on the magnetic structure and transport                    
              properties of pure and doped single crystal cuprate                            
              superconductors.  Researchers in the phases and phase                          
              transitions group are examining phase transitions in structured                
              fluids and the development of statistical mechanical models for                
              their theoretical description.  The thrust area on synthesis,                  
              properties and morphology of novel polymers addresses the                      
              molecular structure and microscopic morphology of polymers and                 
              their associated electrical, optical and mechanical properties.                
              A new thrust on structure and transport properties of grain                    
              boundaries and interfaces aims to determine the intrinsic                      
              structure and properties of high-angle grain boundaries in ionic               
              compounds and oxide ceramics.                                                  
                   The MIT MRL also supports the development, operation and                  
              maintenance of major central research facilities including a                   
              surface science facility operated in conjunction with the Harvard              
              MRL.  It also provides seed funding for exploratory research and               
              supports educational activities that include the provision of                  
              research experience for undergraduates.  The program currently                 
              involves about 29 faculty members and senior personnel from seven              
              academic departments, 10 postdoctoral research associates, 41                  
              graduate students and 20 undergraduates, and supporting                        
              scientific and clerical staff.  The MIT MRL is directed by                     
              Professor Bernhardt J. Wuensch.
