Abstract    :
                   Numerical methods for solving optimization problems will be               
              developed and analyzed.  The research will focus on:  a).  The                 
              Dual Active Set Algorithm, a new algorithm developed by the                    
              principal investigator for solving mathematical programming                    
              problems, will be studied in the context of linear programming                 
              quadratic programming and minimax.  b).  An augmented Lagrangian               
              type algorithm for mathematical programming problems   will be                 
              reformulated in a way that is appropriate for large scale                      
              optimization.  c).  Approximation techniques for optimal                       
              problems, will be extended to handle state constraints. The main               
              emphasis will be placed on applying these optimization techniques              
              in the study of electric fields generated in thunderstorms.
