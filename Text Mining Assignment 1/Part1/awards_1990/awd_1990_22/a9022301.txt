Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              The P.I. proposes to initiate a systematic study of chemical                   
              scavenging processes, with a focus on the relationship between                 
              231Pa/230Th and 10Be/230Th ratios found in sediments and the                   
              composition and flux of particles settling through the                         
              overlying water column.  They will take advantage of the                       
              sampling opportunity provided by the US.JGOFS Equatorial                       
              Pacific process study to derive empirical relationships between                
              the nuclide ratios and the flux and composition of particulate                 
              matter.  These relationships will then be applied to nuclide                   
              ratios measured in the sediments deposited at these sites from                 
              the present through the last glacial maximum, and possibly                     
              earlier.  The objective is to evaluate changes in particle flux                
              (and thus, indirectly, primary production) that have                           
              accompanied, or responded to, past changes in climate.
