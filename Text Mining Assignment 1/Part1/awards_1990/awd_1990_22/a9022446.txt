Abstract    :
              This project is an effort to construct, install and operate a                  
              monostotic Very High Frequency (VHF) wind profiling radar at the               
              Peruvian Antarctic Base on King George Island in the Antarctic                 
              Peninsula.  Similar wind profilers have operated successfully in               
              other remote areas in the western equatorial Pacific, and in                   
              equivalent polar latitudes in Alaska.  The system will provide                 
              nearly continuous measurement of the total wind vector through                 
              the troposphere and lower stratosphere, and is capable of                      
              expansion to make observations of the horizontal wind in the                   
              region from 70 km to 100 km altitude.  The project will be                     
              carried out cooperatively with the Peruvian Antarctic program.
