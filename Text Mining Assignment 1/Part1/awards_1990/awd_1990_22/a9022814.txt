Abstract    :
              This award will support a research collaboration between                       
              Professor J. L. Menaldi of Wayne State University and                          
              Professor Maria Garroni of the University of Rome, Italy.                      
              The investigators intend to study various research problems                    
              in stochastic control and related classic analysis.  Their                     
              study should lead to an enhancement of our basic theoretical                   
              knowledge and expand the range of applicability of several                     
              areas of modern stochastic control theory.  The proposed                       
              project builds on a successful prior collaboration and has                     
              the potential to make a solid contribution to the field.                       
                                                                                             
              For this study the underlying probabilistic models are                         
              described by stochastic differential equations related to                      
              diffusion, possibly with jumps, in finite dimensions.                          
              Mathematically this is a relatively well-developed area that                   
              permits an in-depth analysis of model problems.  For optimal                   
              control, a dynamic programming principle is adopted as a                       
              unifying approach.  This gives rise to nonlinear partial                       
              differential equations, and variational or quasi-variational                   
              inequalities.
