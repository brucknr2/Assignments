Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to purchase a compact, lightweight                   
              rangefinder for use on a robot arm.  The research supported by the             
              arm with the rangefinder includes the development of algorithms to             
              recover superquadrics from depth data, evaluation of the quality of            
              various "shape-from-" algorithms, investigation of the use of real-            
              time sensor feedback to control assembly and parts mating                      
              activities using a hand mounted scanner, and the development of                
              algorithms using the sensor data for intelligent grasping tasks.               
                                                                                             
              The use of multiple information sources is characteristic of much              
              of the current research in robotics.  A rangefinder, capable of                
              real time data acquisition, mounted on a robot arm provides the                
              capability, through moving the arm, of obtaining accurate three                
              dimensional surface data.  Two distinct types of research are                  
              supported under this award.  The first is the development of                   
              algorithms that will use the rangefinder and the robot arm motion              
              to obtain three dimensional information, in real time, about the               
              objects being examined.  The second type of research is to                     
              incorporate the additional information into algorithms for grasping            
              and assembling objects.
