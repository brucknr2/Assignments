Abstract    :
              There is a commercial need for                                                 
              higher valued marine                                                           
              polysaccharides which are used in                                              
              the food and pharmaceutical                                                    
              industries.  This proposal seeks to                                            
              produce these materials by                                                     
              enzymatically lowering the sulfate                                             
              content of certain seaweed-derived                                             
              polysaccharides, such as agar and                                              
              carrageenan.  Being able to do this                                            
              has substantial potential for                                                  
              satisfying the stated commercial                                               
              need, and for producing these                                                  
              materials competitively.
