Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This project is concerned with the dynamics of the                        
              equatorial upper atmosphere and the ionosphere.  The 50 km to                  
              1000 km altitude region of the atmosphere will be probed using a               
              very high frequency (VHF) radar at the Jicamarca Radio                         
              Observatory near Lima, Peru. This facility, operated by the                    
              Geophysical Institute of Peru with support form the National                   
              Science Foundation, is the largest atmospheric VHF radar                       
              facility in existence, and the only instrument in its class                    
              located at equatorial latitudes.  Studies will focus on                        
              ionospheric plasma instabilities (processes which disturb the                  
              equilibrium distribution of the ionized component of the upper                 
              atmosphere  above roughly 100 km altitude), and on measurements                
              of winds, atmospheric waves and turbulence in the 50 to 100                    
              kilometer region.  The shapes of plasma irregularities along and               
              perpendicular to the geomagnetic field direction will be measured              
              using interferometric radar imaging techniques which make use of               
              multiple receiving antennas; such measurements will aid in                     
              developing models of plasma instability evolution. Time                        
              resolution  will be sufficient to  measure the drift velocity and              
              temporal evolution of  plasma structures in a field of view of                 
              approximately 7 degrees (about 12 km horizontal distance at 100                
              km altitude).  Measurements in the 50 to 100 km region will be                 
              aimed at the interactions between wind, wave, and turbulence                   
              processes, and the altitude distribution of turbulence strength.               
              Various radar techniques suitable for such measurements will also              
              be improved and compared.
