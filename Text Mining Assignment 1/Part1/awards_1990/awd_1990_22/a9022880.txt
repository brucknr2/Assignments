Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Miami International Symposia on Multi-Phase Transport and                  
              Particulate Phenomena have now been expanded to include new                    
              areas, including Heat Transfer in Fire and Combustion Systems,                 
              Heat Transfer and Flow through Porous Media, Heat Transfer in                  
              Superconductor Processing, Heat and Mass Transfer in Food and                  
              Polymer Processing, Heat and Mass Transfer in Bioengineering,                  
              Heat Transfer in Composite Media, and Lasers and Thermal                       
              Imaging.  The Symposia provides an international forum for                     
              scientific exchange of the latest research results in these                    
              areas between participants from universities, research                         
              establishments, industrial and government organizations,                       
                                                                                             
              It is the objective of the symposium-workshop to provide a                     
              comprehensive state-of-the-art assessment of the progress of                   
              research, development and applications in heat and mass                        
              transfer and to provide an international forum for information                 
              exchange among active researchers.  It is also desired to                      
              establish a rational basis for the identification of areas of                  
              research in heat and mass transfer and recommendations for                     
              future research and development needs.  There is a need for                    
              improved communications between research workers in university                 
              laboratories and in industry on these subject areas.  The                      
              symposium-workshop and the subsequent dissemination of the                     
              reports and the proceedings thereof will seek to accomplish                    
              these objectives.
