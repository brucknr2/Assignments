Abstract    :
                    This program provides for general support of an                          
              interdisciplinary center for advanced study,  including the                    
              support of selected behavioral scientists for year-long                        
              residential fellowships and the funding of several specific                    
              activities designed to enrich the intellectual environment in                  
              which these residents operate.                                                 
                    The Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral                          
              Sciences (CASBS) was created 36 years ago to carry out this                    
              activity.  Direct stipend support of behavioral scientists                     
              constitutes the core of the Center's purpose and function.                     
              The Fellows supported by National Science Foundation funds                     
              represent those areas of the behavioral sciences that                          
              traditionally have been supported by NSF,  as contrasted with                  
              the Fellows typically supported  by such sources as the                        
              National Endowment for the Humanities and the Andrew W.                        
              Mellon Foundation.  A number of these scientists will be                       
              involved in prearranged collaborative activites considered to                  
              be of high scientific and societal priority.                                   
                    A portion of the program helps the Center identify and                   
              support promising scientists too young to have established a                   
              national or international reputation.  Special efforts are                     
              made to include women and minority scientists,  as well as                     
              some scholars from beyond the nation's largest and most                        
              visible universities.  The program also helps to insure that                   
              a top-quality computing and communication environment is                       
              available for its Fellows.                                                     
                    The Center has proven to be a remarkably successful                      
              institutional innovation.  It can be expected to continue to                   
              strengthen the behavioral sciences and interdisciplinary                       
              collaboration among them.
