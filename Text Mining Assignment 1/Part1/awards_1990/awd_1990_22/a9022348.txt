Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              In this project the distribution of large and small particles                  
              will be measured in the U.S. Joint Global Ocean Flux Studies in                
              the Central Equatorial Pacific (EQPAC) to address two of the                   
              five problems being addressed in EQPAC, namely:                                
                                                                                             
              Problem I:  What is the relationship between physical forcing                  
              and upper ocean biogeochemical cycles?                                         
                                                                                             
              Problem IV:  Which processes are responsible for the transport                 
              and regeneration of particulate and dissolved nutrients?                       
                                                                                             
              The work is designed to fill that gap in knowledge by making                   
              high resolution profiles of small particles using                              
              transmissometer and CTD to obtain simultaneous profiles of beam                
              attenuation (proportional to small particle concentration),                    
              temperature and salinity to compare particle distributions with                
              water structure.
