Abstract    :
              Dr. Cassidy is examining the impact of US policy on the nature and             
              organization of scientific research in the post-World War II                   
              American occupation zone of Germany.  This project focuses on the              
              military phase of occupation through the division of Germany, the              
              descent into Cold War, and the founding of the Federal Republic in             
              1949.  The project combines available American perspectives on US              
              policy, recent German surveys of the early history of German                   
              science organization, and recently available German and American               
              archival resources to achieve a fuller account of the hitherto                 
              little researched subject of the US and West German science.  At               
              the same time, this study lends new perspectives on the orientation            
              of post-war US policy makers toward basic science and the US role              
              in post-war Germany and Europe, both during the early years of a               
              period that is now rapidly drawing to a close.
