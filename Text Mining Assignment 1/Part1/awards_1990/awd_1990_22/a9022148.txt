Abstract    :
              The Human Genome Project burst upon the scene in the period 1985-              
              1986 and has become a major topic of debate among life scientists,             
              ethicists, and policy makers.  The Genome Project is often touted              
              as the first foray into Big Biology -- a biological equivalent to              
              the Apollo and Manhattan Projects.  The debate about genome                    
              projects has had the feel of historical importance since its                   
              inception.  Those arguing for and against it have self-consciously             
              placed this project in a prominent position among the landmarks of             
              biology.  Whether it belongs in this pantheon remains to be seen,              
              but the quality and intensity of debate and the extraordinary power            
              and character of the advocates makes the Human Genome Project a                
              wonderful case study in how a scientific project is placed on the              
              national agenda, and what transpires once it is there.  The Genome             
              Project is thus an ideal opportunity to document the life sciences             
              in transition from pure cottage industry to a mix of Big and little            
              science.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              Because of the evanescence of documentation and memory of the                  
              individuals involved, it is essential to move quickly to establish             
              a strategy for collection and preservation of materials related to             
              the Human Genome Projects.  The Kennedy Institute of Ethics, as the            
              National Reference Center for Bioethics Literature, is holding a               
              workshop of interested historians, social scientists, ethicists,               
              archivists, biologists, and policy makers to begin to formulate                
              such a national strategy.  The meeting is being held at Georgetown             
              University in October, 1990
