Abstract    :
              The acquisition of a 100MHz tester will allow work on testing and              
              validating VLSI chips and multi-chip configurations in a real                  
              environment.  Testing chips at slow speeds does not give the                   
              physical characteristics (bounces and echoes along transmission                
              lines, signal interference etc.) that occur at operating speed.                
              This tester will enable experimentation to be done on chip designs             
              to aid in the search for design rules for correct chip operation at            
              high clock rates.  The tester will also enable conventional testing            
              of circuits to be scaled up.                                                   
                                                                                             
              New chip designs run at such a high clock rate that the                        
              conventional view of the chip as a collection of discrete logic                
              elements no longer holds true.  Instead, the chip is viewed as a               
              collection of transmission lines with switching and signal                     
              modulation occurring at active element points.  In order to study              
              this phenomenon and to derive design rules for the correct design              
              of circuits, it is necessary to test the circuits at a high clock              
              rate.  The 100MHz tester will provide that capability.
