Abstract    :
              Symposium, "Scientific Frontiers and International Issues," an                 
              international and multidisciplinary group of about 50, will                    
              consider the future role of science in international concerns by               
              examining the prospects in three areas--materials science,                     
              communications and information, and biology--and the implications              
              of each for such global issues as basic human needs, natural                   
              resource use, military and economic security, and education and                
              training.
