Abstract    :
                   On September 11 & 12, 1991, the Engineer Manpower Commission              
              of the American Association of Engineering Societies will hold a               
              major conference, "Engineers in America's Future."  The meeting                
              will take place at Loew's L'Enfant Plaza Hotel in Washington, D.C.             
              It is expected to involve 150 to 200 participants from major                   
              engineering employers, the Congress and other policymaking bodies,             
              professional societies, and the press.  Emphasis has been placed               
              on the recruitment of women and minorities as presenters for this              
              meeting.                                                                       
                   The meeting will begin with an assessment of current                      
              predictions as to supply and demand for engineers.  This will be               
              followed by a session examining some of the factors that will                  
              influence engineering in the future, including technological                   
              changes as well as demographic trends.  Then, the meeting will turn            
              to more detailed consideration of these matters, in sessions                   
              devoted to implications of the trends for policymaking at both the             
              national level and at the level of employers of engineers in                   
              industry, services, government and education.
