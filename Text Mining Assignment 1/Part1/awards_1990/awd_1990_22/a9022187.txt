Abstract    :
              This research program will focus on the                                        
              demonstration of coherent sources of radiation in the                          
              Vacuum Ultraviolet (VUV), a region where few                                   
              tunable sources presently exist.  Based on anti-Stokes                         
              Raman scattering in selected small molecules that are                          
              known to be efficient energy storage media, these                              
              coherent sources would exploit the detailed                                    
              spectroscopic information that has been obtained                               
              over the last few years by laser spectroscopy.  Initial                        
              experiments will concentrate on the XeF molecule                               
              which theory has identified as a promising candidate.                          
              Laser spectroscopy of the D  B transition of the                               
              excimer will be carried out in a supersonic expansion                          
              followed by oscillator experiments in longer gain                              
              length discharges.  Subsequent studies will explore the                        
              rare gas and Column   B dimers as potential hosts for                          
              tunable lasers in the spectral region below 150nm.
