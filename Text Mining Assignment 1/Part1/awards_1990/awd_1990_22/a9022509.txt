Abstract    :
              This award will provide an industrial robot arm to be used in three            
              projects.  The arm will be controlled by parallel computers                    
              available locally at the University of Minnesota.  The research                
              projects deal with error correction, motion planning, and control.             
              All of these problems can use the added power of a parallel                    
              computer provided that that power can be algorithmically utilized.             
              Thus the research revolves around algorithm development in these               
              areas for a distributed memory multiprocessing environment.                    
                                                                                             
              Many algorithms used in controlling robots are computationally                 
              expensive.  One means of providing additional computational power              
              for a reasonable cost is to use parallel computers.  This research             
              award is to provide an output device (a robot arm) for use in the              
              investigation of robot control algorithms using parallel computers.            
              The computers already exist at the University of Minnesota so this             
              award enriches the parallel computing research environment and will            
              lead to results on the appropriate hardware/software configurations            
              for effective utilization of robotic devices.
