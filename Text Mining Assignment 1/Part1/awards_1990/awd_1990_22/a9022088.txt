Abstract    :
              In this project, the P.I. will carry out laboratory experiments                
              and numerical studies of unsteady two-layer strait and sill flow.              
              Analysis of such flows typically uses steady or quasi-steady two-              
              layer hydraulic theory, the validity of which has not been                     
              adequately tested for time-dependent flows, such as barotropic                 
              tidal forcing.  The first approach to this problem will be a                   
              laboratory experiment on the effect of unsteady barotropic forcing             
              on the classic lock-exchange problem, focusing on issues of                    
              control establishment and maximal exchange.  The second approach               
              will be a numerical study of the generation of long nonlinear-                 
              dispersive waves by time dependent transcritical forcing.
