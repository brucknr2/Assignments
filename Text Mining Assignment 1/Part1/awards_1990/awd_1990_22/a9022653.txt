Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will provide supplementary support for a long-term                  
              research stay by Dr. Roy Sidle of the USDA Forest Service to                   
              conduct collaborative research with Dr. Makoto Tani of the                     
              Forestry and Forest Products Research Institute in Tsukuba, Japan.             
              They will investigate how soil pipes in forest hillsides influence             
              the subsurface water flow regime, and thus affect initiation of                
              landslides.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              Soil pipes and macropores are recognized to be important conducts              
              for subsurface water during intense rainstorms.  The rapid                     
              transport of large quantities of water into unstable soil mantles              
              during storms can create zones of water pressure buildup, resulting            
              in landslide initiation.  Existing models of subsurface flow and               
              groundwater response do not adequately address the influence of                
              pipeflow.  The research work of Dr. Tani's lab on the effects of               
              soil physical properties on groundwater accretion will complement              
              Dr. Sidle's research background on subsurface flow processes and               
              landslide modelling.
