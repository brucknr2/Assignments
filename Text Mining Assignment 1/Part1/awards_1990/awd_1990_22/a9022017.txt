Abstract    :
              This project is aimed at determining the dynamics of third-order               
              nonlinear optical processes in molecular and polymeric materials.              
              Research to be undertaken will include:  degenerate four-wave                  
              mixing and two-wave mixing pump-probe experiments using amplified              
              60 femtosecond pulses; investigating the role of two-photon                    
              absorption, bimolecular decay, and excitation saturation by                    
              simultaneously monitoring both first-order and higher-order                    
              diffractions during degenerate four-wave mixing; observing the                 
              relative roles of initially photogenerated excitons and                        
              subsequently formed polarons in determining optical nonlinearity in            
              linear conjugated structures.
