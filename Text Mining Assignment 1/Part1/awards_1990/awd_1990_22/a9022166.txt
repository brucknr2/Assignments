Abstract    :
                   Single ions contained in a small electromagnetic trap move                
              in orbits at normal mode frequencies directly related to the                   
              charge-to-mass ratio.  Trapping and loading techniques are being               
              developed and refined to permit mass measurement (relative to an               
              appropriate calibration ion) with a precision that is ultimately               
              expected to exceed one part in 1010.  Improved determinations                  
              will be made of:  the proton-to-electron mass ratio, the proton's              
              atomic mass, the atomic mass of 2H, and the 3H - 3He mass                      
              difference.  These measurements may yield an independent                       
              determination of the fine structure constant, a measurement of                 
              the neutron mass, and may help establish the antineutrino rest                 
              mass.
