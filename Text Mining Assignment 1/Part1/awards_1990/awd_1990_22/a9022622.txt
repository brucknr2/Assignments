Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project studies ceramic membranes modified by a chemical                  
              vapor deposition technique.  The alumina precursor materials                   
              from Alcoa are asymmetric, with an alpha-alumina support and a                 
              5 m gamma-alumina skin layer.  Their minimum pore dimension                   
              (40 ) makes them inappropriate for fine molecular-sieving                     
              separations of small molecules.  A series of fluorinated                       
              silanes are used to provide precisely controlled decreases in                  
              the sizes of the slit-shaped pores of the skin layer.  The                     
              proposed mechanism by which the pore modification process                      
              occurs and its reproducibilty are tested in carefully designed                 
              experiments.  Studies are focused on the measurement and                       
              modeling of the fundamental transport properties of these                      
              model materials.  The detailed morphology of these materials                   
              are probed by gaseous and liquid systems.  The data provide                    
              new insights and allow testing theories for analyzing                          
              transport phenomena in media with pore sizes approaching                       
              molecular dimensions.  The new ceramic membranes should find                   
              new applications in separations of gaseous mixtures.
