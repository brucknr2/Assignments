Abstract    :
              The goal of the proposed effort is to eventually                               
              fabricate a high resolution and high brightness thin                           
              film cathodoluminescent phosphor screen for high                               
              performance display applications.  In order to achieve                         
              this, the Phase I experimental results indicate that it                        
              is possible to fabricated rare-earth-doped CaS thin                            
              film phosphor screen directly on high resolution fiber                         
              optic faceplates exhibiting a screen resolution of 114                         
              1p/mm.  In addition, it has been shown the quantum                             
              efficiency of aluminized thin film CaS screens is                              
              comparable to that of well developed ZnS-type                                  
              powder phosphor screens.  In the proposed Phase II                             
              effort, additional optimization of various thin film                           
              preparation parameters will be carried to further                              
              improve screen performance and to establish                                    
              processes for eventual Phase III manufacturing.  The                           
              Phase II effort will also consist of fabricating high                          
              performance image intensifiers using the new thin                              
              film technology.  Image tube fabrication and                                   
              evaluation will be performed by Varian Associates                              
              Electron Optical Sensors Division.  It is expected that                        
              the prototype image tube will exhibit superior overall                         
              performance to similar tubes containing optimized                              
              powder phosphor screens.
