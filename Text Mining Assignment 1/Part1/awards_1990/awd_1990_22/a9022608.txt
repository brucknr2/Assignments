Abstract    :
              As a monocular observer moves in a 3D world, the parts which can               
              be seen and their geometry change with the observer's vantage                  
              point.  This project undertakes to quantitatively describe and                 
              model the relationships between motion and the induced change in               
              the appearance of 3D shape.  Because motion is such an integral                
              part of this information gathering and processing process, the                 
              investigators are developing a uniform spatiotemporal approach to              
              3D object representation and intermediate-level motion                         
              description for dynamic model-based 3D object recognition.  To                 
              model explicitly the dynamic appearance of objects as the                      
              viewpoint moves, the approach uses "aspect space" which is the                 
              cross product of the image plane and viewpoint space.  New 3D                  
              object representations are being developed in this                             
              multidimensional space, including the asp and the rim appearance               
              representation.  These representations describe how visible,                   
              geometric features of projected shape can change over time due to              
              egomotion or object motion.  Complementing this work on dynamic                
              viewer-centered representations, the research will also derive                 
              intermediate-level motion descriptions from the motion of                      
              features in spatiotemporal image volumes prior to object                       
              recognition and description.  Methods will be developed for                    
              intermediate-level motion description including spatiotemporal                 
              surface flow and flow line detection, segmentation of                          
              spatiotemporal surfaces, and the detection of properties such as               
              cyclic motion and T-junction motion.
