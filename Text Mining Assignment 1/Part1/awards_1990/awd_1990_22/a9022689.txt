Abstract    :
              This study will evaluate the deformational history of the                      
              Tertiary Forlandsundet basin of western Spitsbergen and will                   
              relate the deformational sequence to basin evolution and                       
              plate dynamics along the Tertiary transform plate margin as                    
              it evolved to the modern spreading margin between Svalbard                     
              and Greenland.  Preliminary field work in the basin suggests                   
              multiphase deformation including strike-slip and thrust                        
              components.  In addition, sandstone and conglomerate samples                   
              display signs of ductile deformation with recrystallization                    
              of mica grains and development of penetrative foliation.                       
              Earlier field work also emphasizes the need to resolve the                     
              timing of the deformational episodes.  Investigators will                      
              use macrostructural mapping, paleostress analysis,                             
              microstructural study, and 40Ar/39Ar dating to test working                    
              hypotheses for the tectonic evolution of the basin.  A                         
              multiphase deformational history is certain, and the goal of                   
              this study is to decipher the kinematic history of the basin                   
              and relate that history to the evolution of the Tertiary                       
              margin and the opening of the Norwegian-Greenland Sea.
