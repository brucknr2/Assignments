Abstract    :
              In many problems, information is available from many different                 
              sources.  Aggregating these diverse bits of information is                     
              important to good decision-making but also leads to special                    
              statistical problems in developing models to characterize the                  
              information.  Prior research in this areas has relied primarily on             
              the use of historical data as a basis for modelling the information            
              sources.  The proposed research develops a Bayesian framework that             
              a decision maker can use to encode his subjective knowledge about              
              the information sources in order to aggregate their information.               
              This framework features a highly flexible environment for modelling            
              the probabilistic nature and interrelationships of the information             
              sources and requires straightforward and intuitive subjective                  
              judgements using proven decision-analytic assessment techniques.               
              Analysis of the assessments to produce a posterior distribution for            
              the event of interest is accomplished through analytical, numerical            
              or Monte Carlo techniques.
