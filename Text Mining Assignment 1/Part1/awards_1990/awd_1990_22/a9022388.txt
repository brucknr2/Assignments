Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This instrumentation award is to purchase VLSI design and test                 
              equipment dedicated to research in novel chip architectures for                
              parallel processing and graphics.  The specific research projects              
              for which the equipment will be used include the development of                
              high level specification, synthesis, and testing tools; the                    
              development of a graphics chip for 3D volume visualization; and the            
              development of custom VLSI chips for memory buses in a                         
              heterogeneous parallel computing environment.                                  
                                                                                             
              The development of custom VLSI chips is increasingly dependent on              
              access to computer software that aids the designer of the chip.  In            
              particular, testing tools are critical so as to allow the testing              
              of chips before they are sold or installed in devices.  This award             
              will allow the pruchase of a high speed tester that will                       
              experimentally validate such testing tools.  The chips to be tested            
              incude a three dimensional graphics custom chip consisting of 256              
              separate "voxel" processors and a very high speed memory bus chip              
              to be used in the construction of a high speed distributed network             
              of computers.
