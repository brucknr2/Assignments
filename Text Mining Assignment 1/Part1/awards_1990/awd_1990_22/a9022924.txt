Abstract    :
                   The University of Arizona's I/UCR Center for                              
              Microcontamination Control which primarily studies                             
              microcontamination problems for the microelectronics industry, an              
              industry with a key role to play in the drive for U.S.                         
              competitiveness in the world.  The Center has been in operation for            
              six and one half years, in fully compliance with I/UCRC guidelines.            
              The Center has been active in a number of research areas including:            
              (1) The electrokinetic behavior of particles in liquids used in                
              etch baths, (2) Particle detection and formation in vacuum systems,            
              (3) The detection and control of electrostatic discharge in                    
              production situations, (4) The detection and evaluation of                     
              particles using electromagnetics scattering, and (5) The modeling              
              of Cleanroom Aerosol Dynamics.  The quality of the Center has also             
              been recognized by others.  The expertise in the Center was                    
              instrumental in the award of a SEMATECH Center in the area of                  
              Contamination and Defect Control to the University of Arizona.                 
              This Center complements the activities of the I/UCRC.                          
                   The Program Manager recommends that the University of Arizona             
              I/UCRC for Microcontamination Control be awarded $30,000 per year              
              for three years for a Self-Sufficient Industry/University                      
              Cooperative Research Center Partnership.
