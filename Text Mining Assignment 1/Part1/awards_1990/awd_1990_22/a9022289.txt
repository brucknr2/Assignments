Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The feasibility of coring deep research wells 12 to 15km.                 
              (40,000 to 50,000 ft.) using coiled-tubing drill rigs and slim hole            
              coring tool is being investigated.  A Phase I technical review and             
              analysis was performed of critical components of a coiled-tubing               
              coring system to determine if it is feasible to adapt existing                 
              coiled-tubing rigs to deep coring applications.  The review showed             
              that a 15km (50,000) sampling system could by developed within five            
              years and a shallower system for coring, to 6km (20,000 ft.), could            
              be developed today by retrofitting existing coiled tubing rigs.                
              In Phase II, the construction of a high-strength tubing string will            
              be investigated.  Downhole components required for both the deep               
              and a shallower coiled-tubing sampling system will be tested in the            
              laboratory and in shallow field sites down to 0.6 km (2000 ft).                
              The shallower system has immediate application in mining and                   
              petroleum exploration, shallow scientific sampling, and horizontal             
              drilling.
