Abstract    :
              This award supports the study of rocks of Jurassic age                         
              (Ferrar Group) which cap the Gondwana sedimentary sequence                     
              in Antarctica and are interpreted to be a manifestation of                     
              the thermal processes associated with supercontinent                           
              breakup.  Correlative magmatism is recorded in Australia and                   
              southern Africa.  The age of crystalization of all these                       
              igneous rocks is not well established because of the                           
              difficulties in age determination of tholeiites and altered                    
              silicic rocks.  Recent work on feldspar separates suggests                     
              that at least the Ferrar lavas may be older that currently                     
              accepted.  The results will have implications for:                             
              (1)  petrogenesis of the Ferrar rocks; (2)  age relations of                   
              Ferrar magmatic along the Transantarctic Mountains; (3)                        
              temporal and spatial relations between magmatic events                         
              across southern Africa-Antarctica-Australia associated with                    
              Gondwana breakup; (4)  the tectonic history of the                             
              Transantarctic Mountains.
