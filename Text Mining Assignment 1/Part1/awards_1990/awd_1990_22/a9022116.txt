Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              In 1991-1992, the US JGOFS Equatorial Pacific program will                     
              study the production, flux and fate of organic carbon along a                  
              cross-equatorial transect at 140oW.  From the equator                          
              northward, this transect traverses a steep gradient in                         
              particulate organic-carbon flux and burial at the abyssal                      
              seafloor.  In order to elucidate the fate of organic carbon in                 
              these sediments, an understanding of bioturbation and seabed                   
              particle dynamics (as traced by naturally occurring                            
              radionuclides) is essential.  The P.I.'s propose to test, along                
              this carbon-flux gradient, four hypotheses of biogoechemical                   
              significance:  (1) bioturbation rates and depths vary with                     
              annual particulate organic-carbon (POC) flux to the seafloor,                  
              (2) these variations have a significant impact on the                          
              mineralization and burial of organic carbon in the seabed, (3)                 
              macrobenthic standing crop and mean body size are correlated                   
              with annual POC flux, and (4) seabed inventories of excess                     
              234Th, 228Th and 210Pb are correlated with POC flux on 100-d,                  
              10-yr and 100-yr time scales, respectively.
