Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Track tracing methods using DiI and confocal microscopy will be                
              applied to study the development of mammalian neocortex.  The                  
              normal sequence of development and the pattern of thalamocortical              
              afferents and interhemispheric projections to the neocortex in                 
              the fetal rat.  In addition, the effects of removing the hindlimb              
              in utero on the development of cortical projection neurons and                 
              and subcortical hindlimb representation pattern in brainstem and               
              thalamus will be determined.  These experiments promise to                     
              further elucidate the role of the periphery in the development of              
              cortical specification.
