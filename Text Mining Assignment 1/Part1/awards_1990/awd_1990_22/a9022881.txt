Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The work described in this proposal is based on two new                        
              principles associated with general equilibria.  These principles               
              lead in turn to a new proof of the fundamental existence theorem               
              for general equilibria and new approaches to the construction of               
              algorithms for computing equilibria.  The new proof of the                     
              fundamental existence theorem provides interesting new insights                
              into the nature of equilibria, and suggests extensions to                      
              economies with externalities and nonconvexities.                               
                                                                                             
              This project also leads to new algorithms for actually computing               
              economic equilibria.  These new algorithms appear to promise an                
              increase in computational efficiency and robustness over existing              
              methods.  This increase in efficiency is based in part on the                  
              fact that the new algorithms require a fixed-point solution in a               
              space having dimension equal to the number of individuals rather               
              than the number of commodities.  Typically this means a great                  
              reduction in dimension and hence a similar reduction in                        
              computation time.  This project investigates the properties of                 
              these new algorithms as well as continuing the theoretical                     
              research.
