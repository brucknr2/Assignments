Abstract    :
              This proposal addresses acoustic impedance dynamics in porous                  
              material.  It continues work initiated on an earlier project                   
              which investigated the properties of flexible porous frames                    
              consisting of very long, very fine, man made fibers.  In this                  
              project, the effort is broadened to include a wider variety of                 
              porous materials, and a wide range of sound intensity levels.                  
              Work includes studies both of bulk properties and surface                      
              properties.  The research falls under three disciplinary headings              
              including (1) a comprehensive study of consolidated porous frame               
              dynamics using a new apparatus of special design, (2) further                  
              study of interactions between frame motion and fluid motion in                 
              the pores at high intensity levels, and (3) developing a better                
              theoretical model for the frame that can account for a variety of              
              phenomena including internal resonances.  The ultimate objective               
              is to improve the understanding of the bulk properties of porous               
              materials in air in order to improve the design of porous                      
              materials and configurations for specific purposes such as noise               
              control.
