Abstract    :
                   The PI proposes two main areas of research and study under the            
              FAW award.  The first is the study of what drives plates in plate              
              tectonics.  Models of the forces that drive plates can be tested               
              against actual stress measurements and provide the necessary                   
              discrimination for model verification.  The second area of study               
              is the origin, nature and utility of hotspots and their relation               
              to mantle convection.  The work will involve an integrated                     
              geophysical/geochemical investigation of phase models and resultant            
              conditions required by mantle processes.
