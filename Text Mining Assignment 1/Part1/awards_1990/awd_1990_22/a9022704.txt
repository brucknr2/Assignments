Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal seeks funding to provide the overall management                  
              for a US JGOFS Equatorial Pacific process study to be conducted                
              during the fall of 1991 and spring of 1992.  In addition, the                  
              proposal seeks funding to provide certain scientific services                  
              necessary for the completion of the project:  ship use,                        
              hydrography, nutrient analysis, analysis of doppler current                    
              meter data, acquisition and archiving of satellite imagery,                    
              site mapping and sediment coring.  These services do not stand                 
              alone as scientific proposals and research, but are necessary                  
              to investigators who have submitted scientific proposals and                   
              have been identified as critical to the success of the overall                 
              experiment by the US JGOFS Steering Committee.  The US JGOFS                   
              Rational and Plan for Equatorial Pacific Process Studies, which                
              accompanies this proposal provides the overall scientific                      
              rationale and justification for an equatorial Pacific process                  
              study; it also describes the conceptual plan and experimental                  
              strategy that has been endorsed by the US JGOFS Steering                       
              Committee and the scientists who want to take part in the                      
              study.
