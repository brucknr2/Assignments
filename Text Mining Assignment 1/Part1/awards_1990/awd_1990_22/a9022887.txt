Abstract    :
              This activity will result in production of an implementation                   
              strategy document for the International Geosphere-Biosphere                    
              Programme (IGBP) of the International Council of Scientific                    
              Unions (ICSU).  This strategy document will outline how ICSU                   
              intends to develop and implement the core scientific projects of               
              the IGBP.  The strategy is the result of a substantial planning                
              effort undertaken by the international scientific community under              
              the leadership of ICSU's Special Committee for Geosphere-                      
              Biosphere (SCGB) with substantial input and support from U.S.                  
              scientists.
