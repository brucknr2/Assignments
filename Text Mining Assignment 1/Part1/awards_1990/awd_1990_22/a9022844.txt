Abstract    :
              This project, funded under the Joint NSF/Private Sector Research               
              Opportunities Initiative, will use techniques from decision                    
              analysis to develop methods for improving toxic substances risk                
              assessment, risk management, and research planning decisions.  It              
              will explicitly represent uncertainties in exposure and                        
              dose-response, and use the concept of the value of information to              
              evaluate research initiatives whose outcomes could permit                      
              departures from default guidelines for carcinogenic risk                       
              assessments.  These include use of the most sensitive strain and               
              species, linearized low-dose extrapolation, etc.  A set of case                
              studies will develop decision models focusing on representative                
              regulatory and research alternatives for specific toxic substances.            
              Informal panels of experts will be used for probability                        
              assessments, and the research will be reviewed with interested                 
              parties in government, industry, and other groups.  Case studies               
              will be summarized in terms of specific insights and generalized               
              principles that may be widely applicable.
