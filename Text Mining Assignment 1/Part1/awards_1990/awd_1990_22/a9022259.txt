Abstract    :
                   This Research Opportunity Award funds a project, "Nonlinear               
              Modeling of Power GaAs MESFET for Distributed Amplifiers" at Morgan            
              State University in support of the University of California at San             
              Diego's Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for High               
              Speed Integrated Circuits and Systems.  This two-year project is               
              reporting to the Center's Industry Advisory Board.                             
                   The research is studying the design, fabrication and testing              
              of a microwave Power Distributed Amplifier.  The study will involve            
              the development of new models and CAD programs, as well as the                 
              actual amplifier design and test.  The approach is new and unique              
              and should result in a significant advance in the "state of the                
              art."                                                                          
                   Morgan State has the facilities and equipment to carry out the            
              research.                                                                      
                   The Program Manager recommends that Morgan State University               
              be awarded $100,000 for two (2) years for this Research Opportunity            
              Award.
