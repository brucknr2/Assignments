Abstract    :
              The goal of this research is to study the corrosion processes in               
              refractory metals and refractory metal-bearing alloys. The primary             
              focus will be on the characterization of the microstructural                   
              evolution of corrosion scales using thermogravimetry, SEM, TEM, and            
              XTEM techniques. Specifically, the sulfidation of Niobium, Niobium-            
              bearing Chromium alloys, and Iron-Chromium-Niobium and Chromium-               
              Molybdenum systems will be investigated. In addition, in-situ                  
              oxidation and hot-corrosion of pure Chromium, Nickel-Chromium                  
              alloys, and NickelAluminide will also be studied in the                        
              Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope (ESEM). This will be the            
              first application of ESEM to high temperature oxidation and                    
              sulfidation of metals. The research is expected to help with the               
              development of new corrosion resistant alloys by contributing to               
              the fundamental understanding of corrosion mechanisms.
