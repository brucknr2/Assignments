Abstract    :
                   This award is for the acquisition of a high performance                   
              spectrum analyzer. The analyzer will be used for interdisciplinary             
              projects at UCSD involving lightwave components and system                     
              research, including in particular (a) massively parallel                       
              architectures for terabit packet switched photonic communication               
              networks, (b) high frequency RF optical links (c) study of high                
              frequency optoelectronic sample and hold circuits (c) planar,                  
              monolithic, and array integration of high performance photonic                 
              devices. These research projects, based on a synergy between                   
              optoelectronic device and network architectures, will lead to                  
              higher performance fiber optic communication networks.                         
                   As the demands on networks and communications become ever                 
              greater with the advent of new applications such as animated                   
              visualizations and the necessity for the transfer of large amounts             
              of data over networks arising from supercomputer outputs, it is                
              becoming necessary to vastly increase the capacity to transmit and             
              receive information. A particularly attractive transmission media              
              is light which has an enormous capacity for transmitting data. The             
              research supported by the acquisition of the high performance                  
              spectrum analyzer is in areas necessary for the realization of                 
              networks transmitting and receiving information at rates more than             
              1,000 billion bits/second. It includes both combined                           
              electrical/optical circuit research and research on protocols for              
              routing packets of information through the network.
