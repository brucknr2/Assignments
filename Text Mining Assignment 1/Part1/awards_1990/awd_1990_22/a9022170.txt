Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The objective of this research is the physics of the return               
              stroke in natural lightning.  Much of the experimental work would              
              be performed in Florida as part of future coordinated studies of               
              rocket-triggered lightning.                                                    
                                                                                             
                   Correlated, two-station measurements of electric fields are               
              planned and would be used to better characterize the lightning                 
              near-field environment, and to test the transmission-line model                
              and other return stroke models.  Return stroke velocity, a key                 
              parameter in return stroke modeling, would be measured                         
              photelectrically, and fast time- and height-resolved measurements              
              of narrow-band lightning emissions near the base of the channel                
              would be used to investigate recent hypotheses concerning the                  
              mechanism of return stroke initiation.                                         
                                                                                             
                   Radiometric observations of lightning emissions in the near-              
              IR and visible would be used as a means of remotely determining                
              lightning channel temperatures.  Together with simultaneous                    
              measurements of current, these data would provide a unique                     
              opportunity for testing numerical models of slow time-varying                  
              arcs in air.
