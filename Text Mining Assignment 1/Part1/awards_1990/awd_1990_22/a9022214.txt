Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal seeks to understand the manner in which                          
              communication evolves in infancy.  The importance of this concern              
              is clear, since parent-infant communication is a major factor in               
              the cognitive and social development of the child.  The PI has                 
              rigorously developed a set of hypotheses which hold early                      
              communicative acts involving the use of actions whose functions                
              were not originally tied to communication.  The study will help                
              to isolate how these originally non-communicative actions are                  
              reorganized into an operative communicative system between parent              
              and infant.  In learning about the basic building blocks of                    
              communication, the PI will help to identify patterns of behavior               
              that lead to more, or less, effective socialization of the                     
              infant.
