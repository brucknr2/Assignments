Abstract    :
              This Interagency Agreement supports activities of the Interagency              
              Arctic Research Policy Committee (IARPC) for which NSF has lead                
              agency role.  These activities involve editing and preparation of              
              the camera copy of the Fall 1990 issue of the Journal, Arctic                  
              Research of the United States  The journal serves an essential                 
              step in fulfilling the requirements of Public Law 98-373, the                  
              Arctic Research and Policy Act.  It contains information on                    
              research activities of the Federal agencies involved in the                    
              Arctic and reports and minutes of meetings from the Arctic                     
              Research Commission and IARPC.  This action provides support for               
              preparation of the Journal and documentation of the interagency                
              programs for the 1990's.
