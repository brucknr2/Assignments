Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Description:                                                                   
              The PI and his collaborator at the Geological Survey of Sierra Leone           
              will undertake a detailed field sampling and attitude measuring                
              program of igneous rocks from the Freetown layered complex.  The               
              samples will be analyzed in the U.S. for their concentrations of the           
              platinum-group elements and other related elements, in order to develop        
              geochemical criteria for distinguishing barren from mineralized                
              rocks.  This research will improve understanding of the processes              
              that control the concentration and dispersion of platinum-group                
              metals in the Freetown layered complex.                                        
                                                                                             
              Scope:  This project will enable the collaborating PI and his                  
              institution to develop skills for mineral resources evaluation based           
              on field mapping and rock geochemistry.  Eventually, this research             
              will contribute to a much broader study, to include a characterization         
              of the magmatic framework of the Freetown complex and a greatly                
              expanded geochemical data base.  This project is relevant to the               
              objectives of the Science in Developing Countries (SDC) Program with           
              regard to strengthening scientific and engineering infrastructure in           
              developing countries and increasing cooperation between U.S. scientists        
              and engineers and their counterparts in developing countries.
