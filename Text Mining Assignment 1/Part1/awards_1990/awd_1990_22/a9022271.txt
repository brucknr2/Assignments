Abstract    :
              Paralogs are short polymer analogs of antibody binding sites                   
              (paratopes) used as chromatography ligands.  Like antibodies,                  
              they provide a mixture of binding modes at the molecular                       
              dimensions of analytes.  The Phase I work by Terrapin                          
              Technologies established that these ligands provide a useful set               
              of novel sorbents for separating proteins.  The proposed work                  
              encompasses two extensions of the Phase I work.  First, selected               
              non-standard amino acids will be incorporated to increase the                  
              specificity of the resulting paralog families for particular                   
              classes of proteins, such as glycoproteins.  Second, in order to               
              achieve higher resolution for separating small molecules, such as              
              peptides, suitable chemical modifications of the paralogs will be              
              developed for attaching the ligands to HPLC compatible sorbents.               
                                                                                             
              Both projects address fundamental questions raised by the success              
              of the initial work on paralog affinity chromatography, and both               
              lead to new products with widespread utility in research,                      
              medical, and industrial applications.                                          
                                                                                             
              It is anticipated that Terrapon's ligands will be used as                      
              chromatographic media by research biochemists purifying novel                  
              proteins, by pharmaceutical manufacturers purifying proteins on a              
              preparative scale, and by Quality Assurance laboratories                       
              assessing the purity of therapeutic proteins.
