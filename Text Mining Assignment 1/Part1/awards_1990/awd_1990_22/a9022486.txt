Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project analyzes data on about 4500 corporations in 18th and              
              19th century Russia.   The data were collected under a previous                
              NSF grant, 8419943, published in several articles and a book by                
              the PI.  This new project is interdisciplinary, involving his-                 
              torical and sociological methods, and sociological and economic                
              theories of how organizations grow and die.  Factors include the               
              impact of culture and politics on the growth and structure of                  
              organizations.  Specific variables include credit policies,                    
              tariffs, subsidies, and legal changes.  The goal is to develop an              
              understanding of what produced the distinctive features of early               
              Russian capitalism.  The analyses apply organizational theories                
              of ecological climate and 'permanently failing corporations,' and              
              provide information on their applicability beyond the framework                
              of American capitalism.  After completion of the project, the                  
              data set will be available for other research projects by other                
              scholars.
