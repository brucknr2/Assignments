Abstract    :
              The phenomenon of accelerated deformation observed during                      
              undrained soil creep as a bifurcation problem will be                          
              investigated. A quasi-static linear stability analysis and                     
              a fully nonlinear analysis to analyze the problem of                           
              localization in rate-dependent materials will be performed.                    
              The scope of the proposed research ranges from theoretical                     
              formulation, to micro- and macro-mechanical analyses,                          
              numerical modeling, and experimentation.
