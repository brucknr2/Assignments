              This research focuses on the interaction between modality and                  
              temporal elements in the interpretation of English discourses,                 
              investigating what restrictions should be put on the modeling of               
              these elements in a formal semantic theory.  The initial                       
              observations involve two kinds of phenomena.  The first is modal               
              subordination; it appears that in order to capture the mood-                   
              Reference Time interaction in discourses involving this                        
              phenomenon, we must treat instants and intervals in a model as                 
              non-primitive, defined in terms of events (themselves conceived                
              as partial possible worlds).  The second is the semantics of                   
              utterances which involve reference to times as well as modality,               
              including conditionals and counterfactual conditionals.  Such                  
              examples suggest further restrictions on the modeling of temporal              
              phenomena, including new insights into the cross-world status of               
              the notion of present, reflected in the notion of Speech Time,                 
              which is central to the interpretation of tense in a                           
              Reichenbachian approach, and in the lexical semantics of now and               
              other temporal indexicals.  The main goal of the research is to                
              consider how to articulate the various restrictions with other                 
              considerations in the semantics of modal and temporal elements in              
              English.  The research bears as well on several open questions                 
              regarding the semantics of events and aspectual classes, the use               
              of partiality in semantic modeling, and the role of context in                 
              interpretation.
