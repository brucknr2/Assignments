Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              The U.S. Joint Global Ocean Flux Study is proposing an inquiry                 
              into the cycling of carbon and other bioactive elements in the                 
              central Equatorial Pacific Ocean.  With respect to the upper                   
              water column, key objectives include (1) understanding controls                
              on primary production, which appears anomalously low study given               
              the high nutrient concentrations present in the waters;  (2)                   
              understanding new production in terms of limitations on                        
              phytoplankton growth and pathways of carbon cycling within the                 
              ecosystems; and (3) studying changes in fluxes and ecodynamics                 
              resulting from seasonal and interannual changes in physical                    
              forcing.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              This project will measure net and gross O2 production at 2o N,                 
              Oo, and 2o S during cruises in fall, 1991 and spring, 1992.  Net               
              production from the change of ?O2! will be measured in samples                 
              incubated for 24 hours.  Gross production by spiking will also be              
              measured in seawater samples with H218O and measuring the                      
              production rate of 18O - labelled O2.
