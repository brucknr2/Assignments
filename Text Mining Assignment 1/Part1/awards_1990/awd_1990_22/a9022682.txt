Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project supports a graduate student in cultural anthropology              
              who is studying the changes in women's roles and status in an                  
              agrarian region of Colombia.  Using structured community surveys,              
              intensive life history interviews, and participant observation in              
              two communities, the student will investigate the hypothesis that              
              women are increasing in control of valued resources, which will                
              affect their roles and status within the household.                            
                                                                                             
              This research is important because economic development often                  
              leads to a decrease in the status of women, as men control more                
              resources which yield money incomes.  By studying a regional                   
              economy where women may be increasing their economic status, the               
              case will contribute to our knowledge of how women's status may                
              be maintained and improved while maintaining economic                          
              development.
