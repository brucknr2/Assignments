Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Large loops and filaments of ionized gas have been observed lying              
              outside the boundaries of HII regions in some irregular galaxies.              
              The origin and source of ionization of these features is not known,            
              but they could be involved in star formation feedback processes and            
              in dispersing heavy elements throughout feedback processes and in              
              which they are observed.  The Principal Investigator, explore the              
              physical nature of these structures to elucidate their role in star            
              formation  activity.
