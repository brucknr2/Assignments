Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A new synthesis technique for production of intermetallic alloys               
              and amorphous alloys is proposed that combines magnetron sputtering            
              and vapor condensation.  The nano-sized particles are collected,               
              and compacted and sintered.  Intermetallic alloys of the transition            
              metal/aluminide type are synthesized, and the structure analyzed by            
              several techniques to characterize the chemical homogeneity,                   
              crystal structure, and grain size.  Effects of processing,                     
              consolidation, and sintering behavior are examined with respect to             
              their effects on structure and mechanical properties of the                    
              intermetallic phases.  The ability to produce amorphous phases by              
              these techniques is also under examination.  Deformation behavior              
              of the nanophase materials is studied by hot microhardness analysis            
              and a few selected compression experiments.
