Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research represents a major effort to determine the origin of             
              the main component of cosmic rays in galaxies.  The detailed                   
              distribution of relativistic electrons will be obtained from high              
              resolution synthesis maps of non-thermal radio radiation.  Multi-              
              color optical images will define the locations of various stellar              
              populations, the putative source of the cosmic rays.  Comparison               
              of these two distributions, together with theoretical modeling of              
              the propagation of the relativistic particles, should determine                
              which stellar population really acts as the source for cosmic ray              
              particles.
