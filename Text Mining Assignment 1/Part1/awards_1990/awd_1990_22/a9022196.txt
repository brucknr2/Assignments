Abstract    :
                   This grant supports research which will treat several                     
              aspects of the physics of rapidly rotating nuclei in the mass                  
              80 region.  Spectroscopic studies will determine the                           
              properties of rotational bands which are rapidly changing as a                 
              function of Z and N.  Measurements of moments of inertia,                      
              electromagnetic transition rates, spin alignment, and                          
              signature splitting and inversion will be compared with                        
              theoretical models of the structure of nuclei near A=80.  A                    
              search for electric monopole transitions will be made for                      
              heavier, superdeformed, nuclei as well as for nuclei near                      
              A=80.  In addition, octupole deformation effects will be                       
              studied in the actinide region.
