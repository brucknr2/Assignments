Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              A major goal of the U.S. JGOFS program is to quantify the role of              
              the equatorial Pacific in global biogeochemical fluxes.  Quasi-                
              stationary upwelling of nitrate-rich water within this extensive               
              oceanic regime stimulates primary productivity and can lead to                 
              localized phytoplankton biomass accumulations.  The atmospheric                
              and physical forcings which regulate phytoplankton production are              
              complex and variable and lead to large spatio-temporal variations              
              in carbon fixation rates and phytoplankton standing stocks.                    
              Accurate resolution of phytoplankton processes will require                    
              sampling on appropriate time and space scales as well as an                    
              understanding of hydrodynamical forces.  Toward this objective                 
              the P.I. propose to (1) provide core measurements of algal                     
              pigments (chlorophylls, carotenoids, phycobilins and                           
              phaeopigments) during the two survey cruises (fall and spring)                 
              and the 1992 spring time-series cruise; and (2) conduct photo-                 
              ecological investigations of phytoplankton.  Analytical analyses               
              will employ QA/QC procedures to insure highly accurate and                     
              precise, as well as 'comparable' data.  Photo-ecological studies               
              will incorporate core pigment data to (A) infer seasonal, spatial              
              and depth-dependent variations in phytoplankton biomass and                    
              composition; (B) estimate rates of vertical mixing of                          
              phytoplankton; and (C) bio-optically model depth-dependent rates               
              of primary production from shipboard and moored platforms.
