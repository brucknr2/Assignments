Abstract    :
              This award is for the acquisition of networking equipment required             
              for more effective utilization of an existing Connection Machine               
              CM-2.  There are a number of research projects using the CM-2                  
              including:  visualization of parameterized Julia sets,                         
              computational geometry on a SIMD architecture, simulations of                  
              magnetic films, simulation of quantum chromodynamics, and multiple             
              target tracking algorithms for radar applications.                             
                                                                                             
              The effective use of a high speed, highly parallel computer                    
              requires high speed data links.  This award is for the construction            
              of a fiber optic network linking five sites at Boston University to            
              a large Connection Machine (CM-2).  The research supported by this             
              computer includes mathematical, computer science, electrical                   
              engineering, physics, and signal processing applications.  The                 
              award will make the Connection Machine more accessible and better              
              utilize its high speed computing capabilities.
