Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This provides partial funding for a joint NSF/USGS workshop, held              
              at Morro Bay, CA on 18-22 March, 1990.  Workshop participants                  
              included scientists from academia and from government, from the                
              U.S., Japan, Australia, and England.  The objective of the workshop            
              was to bring together scientists making ultra-precise measurements             
              of crustal movement with those developing sophisticated models of              
              earthquake-related deformation in order to review current knowledge            
              and to define promising new research directions.
