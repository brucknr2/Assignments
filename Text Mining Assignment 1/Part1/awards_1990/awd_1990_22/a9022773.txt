Abstract    :
              Artificial neural network (ANN) algorithms are now used in a wide              
              spectrum of disciplines including neurophysiology, electrical                  
              engineering, computer science, mathematics, and the cognitive                  
              sciences.  But only a small number of economists have used these               
              powerful statistical methods because of their heavy computational              
              demands and because the theory to rigorously test hypotheses and               
              make efficient estimates using ANN does not yet exist for the                  
              types of problems faced by economists.  This project explores a                
              promising method called simulated annealing that could                         
              significantly reduce computational costs and permit rigorous                   
              hypothesis testing for economic problems.                                      
                                                                                             
              More specifically, the grant permits the investigator to purchase              
              additional processors for his computer so that he can use                      
              simulated annealing algorithms for constrained optimization. The               
              additional processors will improve the performance of the                      
              computer and allow the estimation of more realistic economic                   
              models.  The project tests the ability of ANN models to                        
              approximate classical production function using experimental                   
              production data from agricultural economics.
