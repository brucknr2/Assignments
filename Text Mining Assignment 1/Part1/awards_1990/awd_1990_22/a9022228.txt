Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project supports the collaborative research of a U.S.                     
              anthropologist and a Brazilian colleague.  They will study how                 
              the presentation of two different sets of Brazilian "racial"                   
              terms during census interviews affects the percentage of                       
              Brazilians who identify themselves as "non-white".  They                       
              hypothesize that changing the term that the Brazilian census uses              
              to identify people as "mixed" (not White or Black) will change                 
              the proportion of people self-identifying as "white", and that                 
              this change will be affected by socio-economic status.  A split                
              census of a small town in Bahia, Brazil will be carried out as a               
              test.  Controlling for socio-economic status, half the                         
              respondents will be offered each choice.                                       
                                                                                             
              This research is important because Brazil has a complex racial                 
              culture, in which discrimination against degree of Blackness is                
              moderated by fluidity in "racial" categories affected by physical              
              and socio-economic factors.  Understanding the sources of                      
              discrimination in a society like Brazil can help planners in a                 
              binary "racial" society such as the U.S. moderate the effects of               
              racism.
