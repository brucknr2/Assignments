Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The existence of dissolved DNA in the marine environment has been              
              well documented. Recently, viruses have been shown to be an                    
              important biological component of the dissolved fraction of                    
              seawater.It is not known what proportion of the dissolved DNA is               
              truly soluble DNA or DNA encapsulated within a virus particle.                 
              Differentiation and quantitation of the soluble DNA and the                    
              intact virions in the environment is important for both                        
              ecological and genetic reasons. From the ecological perspective,               
              soluble DNA is a form of nucleic acid precursors for                           
              macromolecular biosynthesis. Viruses no doubt contribute to                    
              dissolved DNA and organic carbon production and control the                    
              microbial population by lysing their hosts. Dr. Paul will                      
              develop methods to separate and quantitate viral particles from                
              free DNA in the water column. This study will lead to methodology              
              for the rapid isolation of viruses for future study.
