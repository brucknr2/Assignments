Abstract    :
              In this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and                            
              Organometallic Program of the Chemistry Division, Merola will                  
              study oxidative addition reactions of alkanes to an iridium                    
              complex and investigate the chemistry of the resulting                         
              complexes.  The goal is to develop a catalyst for the                          
              homogeneous conversion of certain hydrocarbons into more useful                
              chemicals, an endeavor that, if successful, would have                         
              important industrial applications.                                             
                                                                                             
              The oxidative addition reactions of a variety of E-H substrates                
              (E = H,B,C,N,O) to iridium/phosphine complexes will be                         
              investigated.  The reaction chemistry of the resulting E-Ir-H                  
              compounds, especially insertion of unsaturated molecules, will                 
              be studied.  In this way important information concerning                      
              fundamental processes occurring at the metal center will be                    
              gathered.  The knowledge gained from both parts of the study                   
              will provide valuable leads for developing systems for C-H                     
              activation and functionalization, catalytic hydroboration,                     
              catalytic amination, and the catalytic addition of a number of                 
              other E-H compounds to unsaturates.
