Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A new Materials research Group is established to investigate                   
              fundamental aspects of physical adsorption and phase transitions               
              in physisorbed films.  The goals of the research are to study                  
              both the structure and kinetics of physisorbed films, and the                  
              nature of these phases and the transitions between them.  The                  
              research is organized into five topics:  (1) melting of monolayer              
              argon films on graphite,  (2) phase transitions of films of                    
              binary adsorbates,  (3) properties of simple gases in a well-                  
              characterized zeolite porous medium,  (4) unusual properties of                
              monolayer and multilayer helium films on weak-binding substrates,              
              (5) desorption and helium atom scattering of films.  Experimental              
              efforts include measurement of heat capacity, in-situ vapor                    
              pressure isotherm study, inelastic helium scattering, high-                    
              resolution low-energy electron diffraction, inelastic helium                   
              scattering, neutron scattering, time-of-flight desorption                      
              measurements, and wetting and superfluid studies.  Molecular                   
              dynamics computer simulation is being used to provide realistic                
              modelling of adsorbate behavior and phase transitions of thin                  
              films and confined fluids.  Interaction potentials, atom-surface               
              scattering, and classical and quantum transitions of adsorbate                 
              systems are being studied in the theoretical thrusts of the                    
              program using potential energy models and statistical mechanics                
              approaches.  The strong coupling of experiment, computational                  
              simulation and theory are making advances not possible by                      
              isolated approaches.
