Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This proposal is to examine and compare sources of contem-                
              porary racial unrest in the United States and in South Africa.                 
              The proposed research builds on previous research supported by                 
              NSF and expands the ecological perspective by (1) considering how              
              the timing and goals of state actions regarding desegregation                  
              policies intensify racial competition and conflict, (2)                        
              establishing a comparative context within which new applications               
              of event-history methods will be applied to the best available                 
              data on racial conflicts in the United States and South Africa,                
              and (3) giving substantial attention to violent events initiated               
              by dominant groups:  white citizens, the police, and other agents              
              of the state apparatuses in the two countries.  The key argument               
              is that initial deviation from complete segregation sparks                     
              intense racial unrest.  This argument is tested using data on                  
              desegregation and racial conflict in cities in the United States               
              during 1960-1990 and in cities in South Africa during 1970-1984.               
              Data on the occurrence and timing of racial events have been                   
              coded from newspaper accounts that provide continuous coverage of              
              events in the United States and South Africa.   The proposed                   
              project uses event-history methods to analyze parallel models of               
              racial conflict in the two countries.  Such models use                         
              information on the exact timing and duration of events so that                 
              effects of changes in racial policies and racial segregation                   
              during this period can be examined directly.
