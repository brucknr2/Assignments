Abstract    :
              This project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry                
              Division is a study involving six experiments dealing with                     
              various topics in photochemistry and chemical dynamics, each                   
              designed to provide new insight.  Among the experiments are a                  
              three-dimensional sub-Doppler spectroscopy applied to the                      
              photodissociation of water; looking at the reaction CN + HCN                   
              going to CNH + CN using isotopically labeled reagents; a test                  
              of the inversion mechanism in the reaction of H with SiD4 or                   
              CD4; Rydberg atom chemistry in the Cs + H2 reaction; looking                   
              for spin-aligned products from Hg* + H2; and an intramolecular                 
              reaction in 3-fluoropropanol initiated by photodissociation of                 
              the OH (or OD) bond to give HF (or DF).

              One of the goals of a chemist is to elucidate experimentally                   
              the elementary mechanisms of a chemical reaction as simply and                 
              directly as possible.  Chemists are constantly proposing new                   
              methods to reach this goal.  This project covers six types of                  
              elementary chemical reactions which will be investigated by new                
              methods or which will be studied for the first time to                         
              illustrate a general principle.  The results of such an                        
              investigation will allow chemists to gain valuable insights                    
              into how chemical reactions occur on the atomic and molecular                  
              level.
