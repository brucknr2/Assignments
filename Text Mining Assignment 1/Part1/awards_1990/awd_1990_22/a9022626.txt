Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary objective of this U.S.-Hungary project                             
              between Dr. Otto Vogl of Polytechnic University and                            
              Dr. Ferenc Tudos of the Hungarian Central Research                             
              Institute for Chemistry is to examine the mechanisms of                        
              oxidation of polyolefins, particularly head-to-head                            
              poly (vinyl chloride).  To do this the researchers will                        
              study the thermal vs. photooxidation of well characterized                     
              head-to-head and head-to-tail polymers, which they                             
              previously synthesized.  Their comparisons will involve                        
              oxidation of these polymers in solution, in the melt, and                      
              in the glassy (amorphous) state.  Results should                               
              contribute to our knowledge of a broader spectrum of                           
              polymer structures which in turn may establish a basis                         
              for developing a basic scheme for degradation of                               
              polymers with carbon-carbon backbone chains.                                   
                                                                                             
              This project in polymer research fulfills the program                          
              objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling                        
              leading researchers in the United States and Eastern                           
              Europe to combine complementary talents and pool research                      
              resources in areas of strong mutual interest and                               
              competence.
