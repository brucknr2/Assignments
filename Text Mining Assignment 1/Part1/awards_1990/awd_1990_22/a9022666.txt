Abstract    :
              Partial support is provided for a symposium which will explore                 
              areas of common interest between two fields -  surface science and             
              tribology.  The purpose is to encourage synergism between these                
              two research communities in order to improve our understanding of              
              the fundamental nature of tribological surfaces, surface processes             
              and films.
