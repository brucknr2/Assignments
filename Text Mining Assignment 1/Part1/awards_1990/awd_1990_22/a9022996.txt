Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports studies of star formation in nearby galaxies               
              by analyzing the distribution and properties of molecular gas in               
              these objects.  The principal investigator has made extensive                  
              studies of the starburst phenomena in galaxies utilizing radio                 
              continuum radiation, and now will explore the role of dense                    
              molecular clouds in this phenomenon.
