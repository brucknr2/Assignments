Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The architecture of the cerebral cortex of the brain shows                     
              sophisticated connections among and between the layers of nerve                
              cells, and within and between functional units called columns.                 
              Nerve cells have very high metabolic rates, and blood flow to                  
              different areas of the brain depends on which parts are most                   
              active at particular times.  Blood flow is altered by regional                 
              changes in oxygen and carbon dioxide content, as well as by blood              
              pressure.  It is known that vascular capillary networks show flow              
              changes with regional, cyclic activity of opening and closing.                 
              The opening of a capillary network to a local region is called                 
              recruitment, and provides local cycling of nutrients (such as                  
              oxygen) and waste metabolites to active biological tissues.                    
                                                                                             
              This work uses a unique approach to combine the concepts of                    
              temporal cycling, capillary recruitment, columnar organization of              
              the cortex, and vascular architecture of the cortex.  There are                
              suggestions that the recruitment cycles here are relatively quite              
              rapid.  Measurements with novel technology will allow new results              
              at a very fine level in time and space, to determine how vascular              
              units composed of groups of capillaries regulate flow in response              
              to demand.  The impact of this novel work will be high not only                
              on the obvious clinical issues, but on the many areas of                       
              neuroscience that deal with functional architecture and activity               
              patterns in the brain.
