Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will investigate the possible use of a high                       
              strength synthetic fiber (Kevlar) to reinforce bridge                          
              columns externally by wrapping the fiber around the column                     
              while being tensioned.  This technique will prestress the                      
              column to provide additional ductility, stiffness, and                         
              strength.
