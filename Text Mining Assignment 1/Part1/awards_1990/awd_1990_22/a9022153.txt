Abstract    :
                   The  Association of Department of Computer Science and                    
              Engineering at Minority Institutions (ADMI) and the Computer                   
              Society of the IEEE will initiate a pilot visiting scientist                   
              program for selected minority institutions.  Experts across the                
              field will be selected to visit minority institutions to assist                
              in strengthening their academic and research programs.  The                    
              visiting experts will be matched to selected institutions for                  
              maximum benefit.  Ten institutions will take part in the first                 
              phase of this project.
