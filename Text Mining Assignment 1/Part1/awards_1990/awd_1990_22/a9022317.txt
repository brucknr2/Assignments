Abstract    :
              This award is made in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and                          
              Organometallic Chemistry Program in support of the research of                 
              Craig L. Hill at Emory University. The award provides continued                
              support for Hill's research on hydrocarbon oxidation catalyzed                 
              by transition metal polyoxometallates. Both thermal and                        
              photochemical systems will be studied. The work will address                   
              fundamental problems in the activation and transfer of oxygen                  
              from metal centers to C-H bonds and other areas of relevance to                
              both industrial and biological systems.                                        
                                                                                             
              The objectives of the research are: (1) to establish the                       
              factors which control product selectivity, catalyst stability,                 
              and key mechanistic features in sustained oxo transfer to                      
              alkanes catalyzed by homogeneous, very active and stable,                      
              oxidatively-resistant inorganic metalloporphyrin analogues                     
              (IMAs), (2) to develop chiral IMAs that will catalyze                          
              asymmetric hydroxylation of alkanes, (3) to delineate the                      
              factors that affect the quantum yields of competing                            
              polyoxometallate excited state decay processes and the                         
              selectivities and turnover rates in hydrocarbon photooxidation,                
              (4) to convert unactivated C-H bonds into carbonium ions for                   
              useful reactions including the catalytic production of                         
              monofluorinated hydrocarbons directly from hydrocarbons and                    
              fluoride ion, and (5) to rigorously establish the structural,                  
              spectroscopic and photochemical properties of                                  
              polyperoxo(oxo)tungstates that have potential for use as                       
              negative inorganic photoresists for microlithography and as                    
              selective oxidants for olefins.
