Abstract    :
                   This investigation is a continuation of earlier work                      
              concerning the structure and evolution of the large-scale solar                
              magnetic fields and motions. The proposed efforts will                         
              concentrate on understanding these structures and their effects                
              on the solar wind and terrestrial environment.  Much of this                   
              research relies on observations made at the Wilcox Solar                       
              Observatory, which this group has operated for more than fifteen               
              years. Several areas of focus include the interior structure and               
              dynamics of the sun via observations of surface motions and                    
              helioseismic techniques; study of the relation between the                     
              development and effects of solar activity and the large-scale                  
              solar magnetic field organization; study of the three dimensional              
              form of the heliospheric magnetic field and its relation to the                
              solar wind and the terrestrial environment. The goal of this                   
              research is to understand the evolution of the solar activity                  
              cycle by observations and analyses of interior and surface                     
              motions and magnetic fields.  ***
