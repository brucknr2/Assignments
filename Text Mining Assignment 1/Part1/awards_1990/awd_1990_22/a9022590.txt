Abstract    :
                   By using the new isothermal plateau fission-track method of               
              dating tephra layers developed by Westgate, by applying a proven               
              detailed method for characterizing (fingerprinting) individual                 
              tephra layers, and by outlining the paleomagnetostratigraphy of the            
              loess, it is planned to develop a reliable and detailed                        
              chronostratigraphic framework for the 3 million year loess sequence            
              with the abundant tephra beds, and plant and animal remains near               
              Fairbanks, Alaska.  The long-studied loess exposures will now be               
              able to be tied together to create a veritable "Rosetta Stone",                
              permitting the dating of detailed geologic, biologic, and climatic             
              records of environmental change in interior Alaska for late                    
              Cenozoic time.  This record then can be widely correlated from the             
              Yukon to eastern Siberia.                                                      
                   The State of Alaska has created a Loess Study Preserve at Gold            
              Hill near Fairbanks where the loess record extends back 3 million              
              years, perhaps the oldest in the world.  Of the three detailed                 
              investigation trenches dug at this site, only one is completely                
              studied; paleomagnetic dating is required on the other two.  Also,             
              only two of the many tephra have been dated here.  Continued                   
              detailed sedimentologic, tephrochronologic, and                                
              paleomagnetostratigraphic work at this and other exposures near                
              Fairbanks will strengthen the preliminary chronostratigraphic                  
              framework outlining the long, cold time periods of loess deposition            
              in tundra environments interspersed with forest environments of                
              interglacial times.
