Abstract    :
              This State-of-the-Art survey award will send Professor                         
              Jeffrey Frey, of the Electrical Engineering Department of the                  
              University of Maryland, to Japan to survey how Japanese                        
              semiconductor manufacturers have organized their R&D                           
              operations for maximum efficiency.  The study is the Japanese                  
              half of a larger study, sponsored by private industry (the                     
              Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC)), comparing the                       
              organization of up to five CAD software development projects                   
              in the United States.  The overall objectives are to                           
              determine whether Japanese organizational methods work as                      
              well in software development as for hardware, to assess the                    
              likelihood of Japanese success in future software develop-                     
              ment, and to assess the current state of the art in computer-                  
              aided design (CAD) in Japan.
