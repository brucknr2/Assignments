Abstract    :
              This project will measure the rates of carbon uptake through the               
              process of calcification and photosynthesis during one of the                  
              JGOFS cruises in the equatorial Pacific.  The overwhelming                     
              contribution of calcite to the sediments of the eastern                        
              equatorial Pacific has long been realized (70-90% of the total                 
              sediment mass is calcite, and less than 1% is organic). Moreover,              
              half of this calcite is produced from the calcified plates of                  
              coccolithophorid phytoplankters which are called coccoliths.                   
              Using published data on accumulation rates in the equatorial                   
              pacific region and conservative assumptions about the ratio of                 
              biologically fixed calcite which is ultimately buried, it can be               
              argued that calcification is at least of equal magnitude to new                
              production in the eastern tropical Pacific. In terms of the                    
              carbon which is ultimately buried on a yearly time scale, calcite              
              dominated the carbon flux while most of the organic material is                
              re-oxidized to carbon dioxide (CO2) within the water column.                   
              This project will document the magnitude of the surface                        
              calcification signal along with the standard photosynthesis                    
              measurements. Simulated-in-situ measurements will be performed of              
              both calcification and photosynthesis.  The data will be compared              
              with the sediment trap data as a cross-check of the sediment-                  
              trap-derived accumulation rates; in a region such as the                       
              equatorial Pacific, which is known for its large current shears,               
              this verification is essential.  The data will also represent                  
              some of the first direct measurements of surface calcification in              
              the equatorial Pacific and will be of significant interest and                 
              use to both biologists and geologists.
