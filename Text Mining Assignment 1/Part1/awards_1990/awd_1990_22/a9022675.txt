Abstract    :
              This renewal proposal addresses fundamental problems of dynamics               
              and intermolecular interactions in condensed matter systems.  The              
              proposed study includes the following materials areas:  Glasses;               
              high-temperature superconductors studied with transient grating                
              generated ultrasonic waves; liquid crystals and complex liquids;               
              and polymer blends - chain structure and microphase separation.
