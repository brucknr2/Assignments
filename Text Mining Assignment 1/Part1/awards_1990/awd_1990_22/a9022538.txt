Abstract    :
              This Faculty Award for Women Scientists and Engineers is made                  
              to Dr. Geraldine L. Richmond of the Chemistry Department,                      
              University of Oregon.  Richmond will continue investigations of                
              chemically important processes at electrode surfaces by a                      
              two-color non-linear optical method.  Molecular species in                     
              solution will be effectively transparent so that adsorbed                      
              species can be probed with high sensitivity.  Thin film growth                 
              dynamics and electron transfer in photoelectrodes and on                       
              microcrystallites will be investigated.

              The NSF Faculty Award for Women recognizes the high quality of                 
              the awardee's record in teaching and scholarship as well as                    
              potential for continued significant contributions to scientific                
              research, the academic profession, and the education of future                 
              scientists.  Particularly noteworthy achievements are                          
              Richmond's encouragement of undergraduate research and her                     
              research in the area of Second Harmonic Generation.
