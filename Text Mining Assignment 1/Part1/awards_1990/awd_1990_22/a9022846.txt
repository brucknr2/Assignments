Abstract    :
                   The general objective of this project is to enhance                       
              understanding of the development of precipitation and                          
              electrification, as well as the association between the two, in                
              warm-based clouds where "warm rain" processes, including                       
              coalescence-freezing, are active.  The work involves study of the              
              cloud microphysical, kinematic, and electrical characteristics                 
              using data collected with the armored T-28 meteorological                      
              research aircraft, in conjunction with data gathered by other                  
              aircraft, radars, and additional observing systems.  The T-28                  
              will probe the interiors of mature convective storms to obtain in              
              situ information on winds, sub-cloud-scale dynamical structures,               
              temperatures, microphysical properties, and the electric field                 
              structure.                                                                     
                                                                                             
                   Electric field measurements made by the T-28 will be                      
              combined with surface field and lightning location measurements,               
              as well as measurements from other aircraft and vertical                       
              electrical soundings, to help deduce the charge distribution in                
              the storms, its evolution with time, and how it may be influenced              
              by microphysical and dynamical charge separation mechanisms.
