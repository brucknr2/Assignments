Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              As part of the U.S. Joint Global Ocean Flux Studies (JGOFS) in                 
              the central equatorial Pacific, the proposed research is a                     
              study of the upper water-column distribution of naturally                      
              occurring uranium and thorium decay series nuclides and                        
              cosmogenic isotopes of beryllium along a N-S transect across                   
              the Equator.  The radioisotopes are used as tracers to gather                  
              information about the rates of biogeochemical processes that                   
              influence the scavenging of chemical species and the                           
              behavior/fate of biogenic particles in the sea.  Specifically,                 
              the data obtained from the distribution of 228Ra and 10Be-                     
              normalized 7Be activities, coupled with those of nitrate and                   
              dissolved carbon, will enable us to estimate the vertical flux                 
              of nitrate and new production at various levels in the surface                 
              ocean.  By measuring the specific activities of 234Th, 230Th,                  
              228Th, 210Pb, 210PO and 7Be/10Be in the dissolved the P.I:s'                   
              will evaluate the forward and backward exchange rate constants                 
              for reactions involving dissolved small suspended particulate                  
              large settling particulate in three depth zones of the surface                 
              ocean, and the scavenging residence time of large particulates                 
              in the euphotic zone.  It is anticipated that the study will                   
              enhance our understanding of the upper ocean biogeochemical                    
              dynamics and cycling in the equatorial Pacific, an area thought                
              to play an important role in global carbon fluxes.
