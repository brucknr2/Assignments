Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This renewal grant is for continuing work on density functional                
              calculations of the electronic structure of high temperature                   
              superconductors.  After nearly four years of intense study since               
              the discovery of the high temperature superconductors, there is                
              still no clear evidence of the mechanism that is responsible for               
              their high transition temperatures.  In light of recent                        
              experimental and theoretical studies, first principles theoretical             
              calculations will be carried out on the electron-lattice coupling              
              in order to assess the role played by this interaction in the high             
              temperature superconductors.  In these new materials unusual                   
              electron-lattice coupling may arise due to the presence of                     
              structural instabilities that are similar to those found in more               
              conventional materials with related crystal structures.                        
              Investigation of such instabilities will therefore be undertaken.              
              Computational techniques which will speed up these computationally-            
              intensive calculations will also be explored.
