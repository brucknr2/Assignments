Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              As a core-task element of the JGOFS Equatorial Pacific                         
              Experiment Programs (EquiPac), Woods Hole Oceanographic                        
              Institution (WHOI) and Oregon State University (OSU) will                      
              combine efforts to deploy a matrix of sediment traps to                        
              understand the variability of particle fluxes in time and space                
              in the interior of the Equatorial Pacific along 140o/135o W and                
              provide critical samples to all EquiPac laboratories.  The                     
              P.I.'s propose to form a precisely synchronized matrix from 9o                 
              N to 12o S through the equator at 7 EquiPac Stations at three                  
              trap depths:  1,200 m, 2,200 m in depth, and 700 m above the                   
              floor; an 800 m trap will be added to the array at the equator,                
              totaling 22 traps, 0.5 m2 opening each, at five JGOFS stations,                
              from the equator to 12o S with a span of 12 degrees, 1,333 km.                 
              A unit sampling period will be two weeks (14 days), the same as                
              the JGOFS N.A. Bloom Experiment.  Samples are pre-poisoned with                
              buffered formaldehyde preservative and, except for during the                  
              collection phase, are positively sealed from ambient sea water                 
              throughout the period of deployment.  WHOI will be in charge of                
              4 arrays with 13 traps to be deployed south of the equator at                  
              0o, 2o S, 5o S and 12o S, and OSU will take care of the                        
              remaining northern arrays.                                                     
              WHOI and OSU laboratories will collaborate to provide JGOFS with               
              data on the following essential components at the earliest                     
              opportunity:  total (dry), carbonate, combustible, biogenic                    
              silicate, and lithogenic fluxes, carbon, nitrogen contents in                  
              combustible organic matter, and organic/inorganic phosphorus in                
              solid and dissolved phase in the sampler cup using three 1/10                  
              aliquots.  WHOI and OSU will complete intercalibration of the                  
              analytical procedure and produce coherent data under close                     
              laboratory collaboration.  A 1/10 aliquot will be archived at                  
              each of the laboratories.  The rest, 6/10 of the flux sample, an               
              average of approximately 300 mg per unit sample allowing a large               
              margin of differences according to station and season, will be                 
              distributed among the relevant JGOFS programs.
