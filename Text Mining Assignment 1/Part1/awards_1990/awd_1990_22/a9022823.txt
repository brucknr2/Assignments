Abstract    :
              The purpose of this research is to extend the investigators                    
              recent work on irreversible investment decisions in a number of                
              interesting and important directions.  One of the directions is                
              the impact of the uncertainty of future environmental regulation               
              on business investment.  A related topic that will also be                     
              investigated is the problem of environmental irreversibilities                 
              and their implications for the design of policies to deal with                 
              global warming, ozone depletion, and related long-term problems.               
              Another topic is aimed at deriving investment rules for projects               
              in which the ultimate cost of completion is unknown, but is                    
              resolved as construction proceeds as in the case of electric                   
              power plants.  Another study will focus on the measurement of                  
              economic depreciation and obsolescence, and the decision to                    
              replace old capital with new.  At issue is how stochastic wear                 
              and tear, and uncertainty over the future productivity of capital              
              can affect the replacement decision, and how they should be                    
              accounted for when calculating depreciation.  The final project                
              involves the study of investment in R&D and the adoption of new                
              technologies.  In particular, the trade-offs between adopting a                
              current technology, waiting for new technology to arrive, or                   
              conducting R&D that can lead to a new technology will be                       
              examined.
