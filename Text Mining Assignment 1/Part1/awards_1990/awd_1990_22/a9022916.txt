Abstract    :
                   A new superconduction tunnel-junction receiver is being                   
              completed by the PI for use in ground-based measurements of                    
              stratospheric trace gases.  This receiver will operate in the                  
              260-280 GHz range with high sensitivity (low receiver noise                    
              temperature).  A separate 'back-end' spectrometer for this new                 
              receiver is not currently available.  This proposal seeks funding              
              for a commercially made dual acousto-opticspectrometer in a                    
              single economical package, having two simultaneously usable                    
              sections with different resolution and total bandpass.  This                   
              spectrometer would allow a flexible choice of high or low                      
              altitude mixing ratio retrievals, or a combined mid-mesospheric                
              to low stratospheric coverage of appropriate species, and be                   
              fully portable in keeping with the intended program of field                   
              measurements in which the SIS receiver will be employed.  The                  
              acquisition of a new spectrometer, in addition to the aging                    
              filter-bank spectrometer now on hand, will allow flexible                      
              deployment of both receivers - e.g., one dedicated for 1 to 2                  
              years of round-the-year observations at the South Pole or another              
              remote site, while the other is used at one or more other field                
              sites in connection with regular observations and the UARS                     
              correlative measurements program.
