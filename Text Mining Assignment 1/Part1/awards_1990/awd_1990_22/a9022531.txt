Abstract    :
                   In preparation for airborne sampling of insoluble particles in            
              atmospheric chemistry field experiments this project in designed to            
              develop insoluble particle collectors with the highest possible                
              efficiency for particles in the diameter range 0.1 - 2.62                      
              micrometer and for particles larger than 5 micrometer.  To overcome            
              the fact that atmospheric particle concentrations are relatively               
              low and to minimize flight time, particles will be collected on                
              large 90 mm diameter Nuclepore filters.  The system and its                    
              placement and orientation on the aircraft will be designed in such             
              a way as to minimize loss of particles in the intake.  This will               
              compare the extent to which airborne particle recovery is                      
              representative of particles collected on stationary, high elevation            
              platforms.
