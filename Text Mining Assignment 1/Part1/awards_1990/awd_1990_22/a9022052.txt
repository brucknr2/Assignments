Abstract    :
              This project will study crack propagation in                                   
              articular cartilage in the underlying bone of                                  
              joints using both analytical and experimental                                  
              techniques.  Finite element analytical models,                                 
              using layers of two different materials, will                                  
              be constructed to study the parameters that                                    
              influence the fracture process.  The                                           
              experiments will be used to verify the                                         
              theoretical predictions and to determine the                                   
              morphology of impact-induced cracks in                                         
              osteoarthritic animals.  The work is expected                                  
              to provide new basic information on the load                                   
              bearing capability of layered soft materials.                                  
              The eventual benefit will be a new                                             
              understanding of fracture in joints, and in                                    
              using this new knowledge to design novel                                       
              impact resistant materials.
