Abstract    :
              Recent Federal legislation has increased the importance of the                 
              contingent valuation(CV) method for valuing goods, particularly                
              environmental amenities, not sold in markets.  The method is now               
              widely used but is subject to several theoretical and applied                  
              problems that have led to lively debates among economists as well              
              as extensive litigation in the courts.  This proposal outlines                 
              two studies designed to improve CV methods and, specifically, the              
              use of expressed willingness to pay(WTP) measures of resource                  
              value.  The first study examines how much, and what kind of,                   
              information should be provided to respondents as part of a CV                  
              study.  The second study explores linkages between CV methods and              
              the multiattribute utility approaches commonly used in the                     
              decision sciences.  This study has as its core the belief that                 
              preferences are constructive and that determinations of total                  
              resource values can arise only through an understanding of the                 
              component parts.  By helping to resolve these two vexing problems              
              currently facing CV researchers, results of the proposed studies               
              will improve the defensibility of an important approach to                     
              estimating economic value.
