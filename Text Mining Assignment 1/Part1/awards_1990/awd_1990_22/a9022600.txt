Abstract    :
                   Three distinct, yet connected areas of non-linear                         
              interactions in plasma physics are studied experimentally:                     
              Langmuir turbulence in unmagnetized plasmas, non-linear waves                  
              and instabilities in non-neutral plasmas, and non-linear                       
              whistler wave-particle interactions.                                           
                   The validity and limitations of weak turbulence theory                    
              and the transition from weak to strong Langmuir turbulence                     
              will be investigated.  Nonlinear wave particle interactions in                 
              the magnetosphere will be simulated and anisotropic whistler                   
              instabilities will be studied.  Non-neutral plasmas will be                    
              investigated in a regime where non-linear interactions, such                   
              as ponderomotive force effects, can be explored.  The research                 
              will lead to improved understanding of fundamental processes                   
              in non-linear plasma environments.
