Abstract    :
              This award will support collaborative research between                         
              Professors Alex Marin and Steven Ahlen of Boston University                    
              and Professor Giulio Auriemma of the Universita di Roma,                       
              Italy.  The researchers intend to continue research in                         
              particle physics and astrophysics using the world's largest                    
              and one of the most sensitive and highest resolution                           
              underground cosmic ray detectors, MACRO.                                       
                                                                                             
              The study of the universe has in some sense evolved into a                     
              branch of particle physics.  New discoveries are possible                      
              that could provide experimental evidence or constraints for                    
              the theoretical predictions of the Grand Unified and                           
              Supersymmetry Theories.  Furthermore, questions pertaining to                  
              the nature of high energy cosmic rays, their origin,                           
              acceleration and propagation mechanisms may be addressed                       
              throughout the observation of high energy multiple muon                        
              bundles that penetrate to the detector depth underground. By                   
              virtue of MACRO's depth underground, fine grain tracking                       
              capability, and large acceptance, it is ideally suited for a                   
              comprehensive study of multiple muon bundles that reflect                      
              the nature of the high energy primary cosmic rays interacting                  
              at the top of the atmosphere.
