Abstract    :
                   The objective of this research is the analysis and                        
              interpretation of radar and electrical observations made near                  
              Darwin, Australia during a recent field experiment.  The                       
              interpretive work includes the testing of a number of hypotheses               
              designed to explain the relationships between convective                       
              structure, the existence and type of lightning over land and sea.              
              Additional work will be devoted to a search for warm cloud                     
              lightning and the traditional problem of the diurnal variation in              
              the global electrical circuit.
