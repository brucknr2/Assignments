Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a cooperative US-USSR research project involving the                   
              Institute for Physical Science and Technology of the                           
              University of Maryland and the Oil and Gas Research Institute                  
              of the USSR Academy of Sciences in Moscow.  The research is                    
              concern with the development of theories of static and dynamic                 
              critical phenomena.  The goal is to develop accurate                           
              representatives of the thermodynamic and transport properties                  
              of fluid mixtures in the critical region which can be used for                 
              engineering applications such as the evaluation of                             
              thermodynamic cycles involving supercritical fluids, heat-                     
              transfer calculations in supercritical fluids, and evaluation                  
              of the performance of supercritical extraction process.  This                  
              project will involve three staff members at the Oil and Gas                    
              Research Institute of the USSR Academy of Sciences and one                     
              staff member of the Grozny Oil Institute working at the                        
              University of Maryland.  This cooperative research will                        
              provide the US research group with a large amount of                           
              experimental information to test their theoretical results.                    
              One graduate student from the Maryland group will visit the                    
              Oil and Gas Research Institute and/or the Grozny Oil                           
              Institute.
