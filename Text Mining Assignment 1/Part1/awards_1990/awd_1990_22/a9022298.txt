Abstract    :
              Particulate and emissions regulations suggest that methanol                    
              fueled diesels need to be investigated as an alternative to                    
              control technologies.  Methanol has a high autoignition                        
              temperature, and requires a system to improve its ignition.  A                 
              promising solution is to use an on-board catalytic reactor to                  
              generate dimethyl ether (DME) from the methanol fuel.  The DME                 
              is aspirated into the engine, and ignites the main methanol                    
              charge.  In phase I, it was shown that ignition angle can be                   
              adjusted by controlling the DME concentration.  Maximum                        
              cylinder pressures and rates of pressure rise were compatible                  
              with current engine designs.  Exhaust concentrations of CO and                 
              hydrocarbons were slightly increased, although the absolute                    
              levels were still low.  The mechanism by which DME ignites the                 
              methanol was identified, and a preliminary DME reaction                        
              mechanism was developed.  In Phase II the functional                           
              relationship between DME concentration, ignition angle,                        
              emissions, and engine efficiency will be determined.  A                        
              control system will be developed and the entire system tested                  
              using a steady-state approximation to the EPA transient test                   
              cycle with bottled DME.  The mechanism responsible for the low                 
              temperature ignition of DME will be determined and combustion                  
              modelling to support system development will be carried out.                   
                                                                                             
              The research addresses the key problem in methanol diesel                      
              engines; unacceptably long ignition delay.  This technology                    
              makes possible use of methanol to meet particulate standards,                  
              without requiring extensive engine modifications or expensive                  
              fuels.  Significant interest has been expressed by the major                   
              diesel manufacturers.
