Abstract    :
              The Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) collects information                 
              annually from a representative national sample of some 7,000                   
              families, about 20,000 individuals, and processes it for                       
              dissemination to a broad segment of the social science community.              
              A national sample of 2,000 Latino households was added in the                  
              1990 interviewing year, although the costs of planned ongoing                  
              annual interviews with this sample are not part of this project.               
              This grant will extend the PSID for five additional years,                     
              covering interviewing waves 25 (1992) through 29 (1996).                       
                                                                                             
              The additional waves of data will add substantial value to the                 
              data set's research potential.  The added waves will vastly                    
              increase the amount and quality of intergenerational data for the              
              numerous parent-child and sibling pairs in adult ages; facilitate              
              refinements in business-cycle studies; improve analyses of rare                
              life events and long-term effects of life events by providing                  
              more than a quarter century of life-cycle information on workers               
              and families; expand the issues that spells analysis can address;              
              make possible international comparisons with similar income-                   
              dynamics panel studies that have been launched in a number of                  
              European countries; ensure that social scientists will continue                
              to be able to monitor the effects of changing economic and social              
              conditions and policies; and enhance the research potential of                 
              recent additions to the study by extending their measurement                   
              period.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              Five more years of data will also permit the PSID to become a                  
              data resource for research on economics and global change.                     
              Information will be gathered that will permit better estimates of              
              the likely behavioral adjustments to the changing conditions                   
              occasioned by global environmental change.  The behaviors of                   
              interest include geographic mobility, energy consumption and                   
              inter-sector labor mobility.  The new data linked to data                      
              collected in the past will also permit better analysis of the                  
              likely distribution consequences of global changes -- who wins                 
              and loses -- in terms of income, employment and health.
