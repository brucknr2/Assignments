Abstract    :
              In this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and                            
              Organometallic Program of the Chemistry Division, Meyer will                   
              continue fundamental studies of the photochemistry of                          
              transition metal complexes.  This work may provide a framework                 
              by which our understanding of natural processes such as                        
              photosynthesis will be enhanced.                                               
                                                                                             
              The principal goal of the work is to gain insights into the                    
              fundamental details of how electron and energy transfer occur                  
              following MLCT excitation and how they can be controlled by                    
              synthetic design.  Studies of electron transfer in the inverted                
              region, including a detailed study of temperature and medium                   
              effects, will be continued.  New intramolecular redox systems                  
              will be prepared which contain a variety of both electron                      
              transfer donors and acceptors.  A systematic study of the redox                
              separated states formed by the photolysis of these complexes                   
              will be directed toward the goal of maximizing quantum                         
              efficiencies and lifetimes.  Chemical systems will be assembled                
              that feature intramolecular time delays, in which the                          
              interconversion of two states is mediated by a third, higher                   
              energy state.  A final goal is the preparation of a family of                  
              extended, ligand-bridged complexes which will provide a means                  
              for studying electron transfer over very long distances.
