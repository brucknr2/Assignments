Abstract    :
              Professor Christophorou is supported by a grant from the                       
              Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to study electron                      
              attachment to electronically excited states of molecules.                      
              These measurements are of interest in radiation chemistry, for                 
              example.  When ionizing radiation slows down due to                            
              interactions with matter it produces an abundance of excited                   
              molecules or fragments of molecules and slow electrons.  The                   
              high probability of capture of slow electrons by excited                       
              molecules is Professor Christophorou's important discovery.                    
                                                                                             
              This project will identify molecules which can be excited to                   
              superexcited states and determine whether the observed                         
              extremely large cross sections for electron attachment to                      
              low-lying excited states are common to all molecules.  These                   
              measurements are difficult because one has to first produce                    
              large numbers of electronically excited molecules then carry                   
              out electron attachment measurements before they relax back to                 
              the ground electronic state.
