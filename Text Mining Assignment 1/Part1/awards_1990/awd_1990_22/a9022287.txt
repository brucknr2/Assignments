Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The proposed work is for research of thin silicon films on                     
              relatively low melting point glass.  Polycrystalline silicon is a              
              semiconductor which can be used to fabricate transistors.  Low                 
              temperature (550 C) processing of polysilicon opens up new areas               
              of application such as electronics for large-area displays and                 
              images.  However, because the material is deposited rather than                
              grown as a single crystal and cut into wafers, it makes it                     
              possible to consider concepts of multi-level three dimensional                 
              integration since lower processing temperatures allow for                      
              compatibility between layers.  CMOS circuitry will be developed                
              and multi-level aspects addressed for vertical integration.
