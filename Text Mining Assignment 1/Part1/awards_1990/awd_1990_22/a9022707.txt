Abstract    :
              The project consists of a series of related empirical studies on               
              the determinants of business saving and business fixed investment              
              in the United States.  While these are traditionally areas of                  
              activist fiscal policy, there is still very little convincing                  
              empirical evidence on a variety of important topics.  Those to be              
              studied are: the relationship between household and business                   
              saving; an analysis of the pattern of business fixed investment                
              since the Tax Reform Act of 1986; a comparison of alternative                  
              models of business fixed investment; and an examination of the                 
              relationship between overall domestic U.S. investment and foreign              
              direct investment in the United States.                                        
                                                                                             
              The project should increase our understanding of the extent to                 
              which fiscal policy can and has influenced capital accumulation in             
              the U.S.  This is an area of intense policy activism, but the state            
              of economic knowledge remains largely based on theoretical                     
              predictions instead of the type of empirical analysis carried out              
              under this project.  The contribution from this project is                     
              especially timely and important because it helps explain recent                
              changes in the U.S. economic environment, such as the sharp decline            
              in corporate saving, the large increase in capital inflows from                
              abroad, and the unexpected strong performance of business fixed                
              investment since the Tax Reform Act of 1986.
