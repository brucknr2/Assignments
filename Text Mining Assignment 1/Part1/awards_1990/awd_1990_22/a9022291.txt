Abstract    :
              This is a Phase II SBIR proposal to develop the GaAs readout and               
              preprocessing electronics chip of the linear one-dimensional (1-D)             
              and Z-dimensional (Z-D) infrared focal plane array (IR-FPA). Top-Vu            
              Technology will design, layout, fabricate and test a prototype chip            
              using commercial GaAs MESFET technology. The expected results will             
              include a Nx1 array readout and multiplexing GaAs chip. The                    
              preprocessing electronics will be designed, fabricated and tested.
