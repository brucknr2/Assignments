Abstract    :
              Basic research on MeV energy Si, Be, and B                                     
              implantations will be performed.  MeV energy                                   
              implantations will be performed at room                                        
              temperature into semi-insulating or semi-conducting                            
              InP and GaAs substrates in the energy range 1 -20                              
              MeV and dose range 5 x 1012 - 2 x 1015 cm -2.                                  
              The  effect of tilt from normal axis, and rotation                             
              angle from the major flat, on the shape of the MeV                             
              energy as-implanted SIMS atomic density depth                                  
              profiles will be studied.  SIMS measurements will                              
              be performed on the variable energy Si, Be, and Fe                             
              as-implanted samples to find the four statistical                              
              moments of the atomic density depth distributions                              
              namely, projected range (Rp), straggle ( Rp),                                  
              skewness (y), and kurtosis (B).  These four                                    
              statistical moments will be used in profile                                    
              reconstruction using the Pearson IV distribution.                              
              Experimental statistical moments found in our                                  
              study will be useful to predict the MeV energy                                 
              implant profiles required for device and modeling.
