Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project constitutes a part of the United States Joint                     
              Global Ocean Flux Study to be conducted in the Central                         
              Equatorial Pacific in 1992.  Metazoan zooplankton have been                    
              identified as the most likely agents for particle                              
              transformation and subsequent export of organic matter to                      
              deeper ocean layers.  thus, understanding the functioning and                  
              assessing the efficiency of the biological pump, that is the                   
              downward fluxes of carbon and nitrogen resulting from the                      
              balance of production and consumption of biological material by                
              the pelagic community, requires knowledge of the rates at which                
              zooplankton consume and transform suspended particles.  This                   
              project will examine in detail the role of metazoa zooplankton                 
              in the biological pump of the central equatorial Pacific Ocean.                
              Sophisticated techniques will be used to assess the variability                
              in the upper 200 m of mesozooplankton biomass, grazing rates                   
              and fecal matter production rates.  Size specific and community                
              based rates of phytoplankton consumption will be compared with                 
              phytoplankton production and fecal matter production will be                   
              related to particulate organic carbon and nitrogen flux to                     
              establish what percentage of the photosynthetically fixed                      
              carbon is ingested and potentially exported to deeper zones.                   
              this project will provide critical information necessary to                    
              quantify the flow of carbon and nitrogen in the upper layers of                
              the central equatorial Pacific.
