Abstract    :
                   This Faculty Award for Women Scientists and Engineers is                  
              made to Dr. Regina Liu of the Department of Statistics, Rutgers                
              University.  Dr. Liu will continue her work on three topics:                   
              multivariate data analysis via data depths, a unified theory of                
              resampling, and robust estimation based on trimming.                           
                   The NSF Faculty Award for Women recognizes the high quality               
              of the awardee's record in teaching and scholarship as well as                 
              potential for continued significant contributions to scientific                
              research, the academic profession, and the education of future                 
              scientists.  Dr. Liu will continue to work in several areas of                 
              Statistics, in particular in multivariate data analysis and                    
              resampling techniques.  Particularly noteworthy is her initiative              
              in organizing a series of regional conferences involving                       
              participants from academics and industry.
