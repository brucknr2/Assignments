Abstract    :
                   An automated radon monitoring instrument developed at Drexel              
              University for the direct analysis of atmospheric radon in the                 
              remote marine atmosphere has been in operation in Bermuda for                  
              more than a year.                                                              
                   The purpose of the proposed project is to perform a series                
              of studies in the laboratory and in the field to characterize                  
              fully the instrumental and sampling attributes affecting the                   
              overall analytical efficiency of the field radon instrument in                 
              order to validate the methodology and the analytical results.                  
              The characterization studies are designed to provide:                          
                   1.  Assessment of the efficiency of radon sampling and its                
                       dependency upon operating temperatures.                               
                   2.  Calibration of the counting efficiency of each of the                 
                       six Lucas cells which have been operational in the                    
                       Bermuda instrument.                                                   
                   3.  Calibration of the Bermuda instrument and a second new                
                       instrument using double blind standard additions.                     
                   4.  Intercomparison, using an independent referee, of both                
                       field and laboratory analyses by the two Drexel                       
                       instruments with instruments of the Environmental                     
                       Measurements Laboratory of the Department of Energy, the              
                       Australia Nuclear and Technology Organization, and the                
                       Centre des Faibles Radioactivities, CNRS, France. //
