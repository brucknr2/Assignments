Abstract    :
              This project consists of two parts.  The first involves the                    
              extension of previous research on the foundations of monetary                  
              economics.  This research will formally address the issues of how              
              exchange takes place and which objects come to play the role of                
              money, or a medium of exchange.  Much progress has been made                   
              towards understanding the development of both commodity and fiat               
              money in abstract economic models.  Further work includes the                  
              resolution of some technical issues concerning the theoretical                 
              models and even, more importantly, the development of simplified               
              versions of the framework that can be used to address substantive              
              issues, including policy issues in monetary economics.   The second            
              part of the study is to investigate some implications of explicitly            
              incorporating a household production sector in models of                       
              macroeconomic activity.  Some preliminary analysis indicates                   
              household production can have an important qualitative and                     
              quantitative impact in an otherwise standard model of the business             
              cycle.  Future work includes the analysis of these business cycle              
              implications, and the investigation of the impact of household                 
              production in theories of unemployment, economic growth, and public            
              finance.
