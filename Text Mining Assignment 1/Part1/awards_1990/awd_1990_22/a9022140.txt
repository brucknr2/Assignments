Abstract    :
                   This award by the National Science Foundation provides core               
              support to the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute located                
              at Berkeley, California.  The fundamental goal of the                          
              Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (MSRI) is to stimulate                
              and invigorate research in the mathematical sciences by bringing               
              together, in a programmatically focused scientific environment,                
              the top mathematical scientists nationally and internationally in              
              given research subjects.  The interaction of senior and mid-level              
              scholars and the very best postdoctoral fellows in a given field               
              produces an intensely stimulating and exciting environment where               
              new ideas can be exploited and developed.  The MSRI places a high              
              priority on the training of postdoctoral researchers, and the                  
              scientific structure and budgetary allocations of funds reflect                
              this commitment.  Normally, two academic-year scientific research              
              programs take place each year. In addition to these academic year              
              programs, the MSRI conducts workshops, conferences, and                        
              microprograms which complement the year-long activities.  The                  
              MSRI also supports summer research and training programs for                   
              graduate students.  Every effort is made to schedule programs of               
              timely research interest and opportunities exist for                           
              cross-programmatic collaboration and scientific exchange.
