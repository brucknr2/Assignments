Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will support collaborative research in physics                      
              between Dr. Robert Brandenberger, Brown University and Dr.                     
              Anne Christine Davis, University of Cambridge, England.                        
              The proposed research deals with the role which topological                    
              defects that arise in many particle physics models play in                     
              cosmology, and conversely, with the constraints that can be                    
              put on particle physics models by investigating their                          
              cosmological consequences.                                                     
                                                                                             
              Topological defects are playing an increasing role in                          
              cosmology.  They are invoked in many theories to explain                       
              the origin of galaxies, clusters and the large-scale                           
              structure of the universe.  Specifically, it is proposed to                    
              study the microphysics of topological defects.  Cosmological                   
              consequences of some non-standard particle physics models                      
              will also be explored.  These studies may provide new                          
              information about the state of matter at energies which                        
              will never be accessible in accelerators. This project will                    
              benefit from the complementary expertise of the US                             
              investigator in cosmological applications and the experience                   
              in field theory of the British collaborator.
