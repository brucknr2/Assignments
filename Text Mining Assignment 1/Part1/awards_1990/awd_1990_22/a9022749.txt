Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              The US Joint Global Ocean Flux Study US JGOFS seeks to                         
              understand the processes governing the production and fate of                  
              biogenic material in the sea well enough to predict their                      
              influences on, and responses to global scale perturbations.                    
              This will be done by identifying and quantifying the physical,                 
              chemical and biological processes controlling biogeochemical                   
              cycling in the ocean, and their interaction with the global                    
              atmosphere.  The implicit assumption of this strategy for                      
              achieving a predictive capability is that the processes and                    
              interactions quantified today respond linearly to global scale                 
              perturbations and that knowledge of the present biogeochemical                 
              system dynamics will, therefore, allow us to predict response                  
              to global perturbations with accuracy.  This is a fundamental                  
              assumption and is the keystone of the JGOFS strategy for                       
              predictive capability.  The scientific justification for this                  
              assumption has never been stated and the object of this work is                
              to verify this assumption.
