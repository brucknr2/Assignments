Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This project investigates the normative structure of explan-              
              ations for actions.  The investigation is based on sociological                
              theories of the need to develop 'accounts,' acceptable explana-                
              tions for potentially disruptive acts.  Hypotheses tested are:                 
              (1) that acceptance of explanations increases with the degree of               
              agreement upon norms of acceptable behavior; (2) that independent              
              of norms, acceptance increases if the person offering an explana-              
              tion has high status; (3) that role and status expectations                    
              determine what type of accounts are most acceptable; and (4) that              
              where dissension exists on norms, higher levels of justifications              
              are required.  Implications for support or disconfirmation of                  
              each hypothesis, in terms of several competing theories, are                   
              stated.  The project uses controlled social experiments to create              
              norms, violations, and justifications, to test the hypotheses.
