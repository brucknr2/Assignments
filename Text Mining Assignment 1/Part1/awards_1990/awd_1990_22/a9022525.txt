Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Principal Investigator plans to investigate three issues central to            
              the understanding of disordered solids:  1) structural                         
              metastability in amorphous silicon; 2) apparant Bloch-like nature              
              of electronic states in amorphous carbon; 3) microscopic mechanism             
              of electronic conduction in disordered metals such as inversion                
              layers in metal-oxide-semiconductor structures.  New theoretical               
              and computational methods will be developed for solving the                    
              electronic Schroedinger Equation for disordered materials.
