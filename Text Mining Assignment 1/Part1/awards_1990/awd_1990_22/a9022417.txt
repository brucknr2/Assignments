Abstract    :
              This award supports the travel of US scientists to a NATO                      
              workshop:  Advanced Research Workshop:  The last deglaciation:                 
              absolute and radiocarbon chronologies.  The purpose of the                     
              meeting is to discuss the variations in the atmosphere's 14C/C                 
              ratio as determined from measurements on tree rings, corals, and               
              varied sediments and the possible causes for these changes.                    
              Experts in dendrochronology, geochronology, paleomagnetism and                 
              annually layered sediments will attend.  This topic is important               
              because it helps unravel the climate of the past 20,000 years.
