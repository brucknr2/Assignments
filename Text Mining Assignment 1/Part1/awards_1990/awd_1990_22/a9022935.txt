Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This project extends a theory of decision making in or-                   
              ganizations.  It will compare several decision strategies in                   
              terms of effectiveness as functions of the communication and                   
              influence structure.  The theoretical extensions include accoun-               
              ting for individual differences, unstable or 'chaotic' network                 
              structures, and increasingly complex payoff interdependencies.                 
              After theoretical development, research will test and apply the                
              theory in three settings: computer simulations, controlled                     
              laboratory experiments, and natural settings.  Results should                  
              link social exchange theories to theories of network selection                 
              and organizational behavior.
