Abstract    :
              A Phase II program is proposed to complete the                                 
              scientific research for a new concept for the design of                        
              broad area (102 - 104 cm2), high energy electron guns.                         
              This plasma electron (PE) gun uses a plasma, which                             
              is generated in a cold cathode discharge, as the                               
              source of electrons.  The electrons are extracted in an                        
              array of beamlets which pass through a thin metal foil                         
              window, its support structure and into air with                                
              minimum losses.  The result is an innovative electron                          
              gun concept which is expected to offer substantial                             
              benefits relative to existing designs including higher                         
              electrical efficiency (>85%), higher operating                                 
              voltages (>400 kV) and lower cost (>$4/Watt).                                  
              These attributes are critical for many applications.                           
                                                                                             
              The Phase I project successfully demonstrated the                              
              basic feasibility of the PE-gun concept using a small-                         
              scale, low energy device.  The Phase II objective is to                        
              complete the PE-gun research program by performing                             
              experiments with a large-area device at high energy.                           
              This effort will consist of five tasks culminating in the                      
              operation of an experimental 5 x 20 cm2, 400 kV PE-                            
              gun at a beam power level of 2.4 kW.  Success in                               
              Phase II will provide a firm foundation for the                                
              development of commercial PE-gun systems in Phase                              
              III.
