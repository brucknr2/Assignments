Abstract    :
              In this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and                            
              Organometallic Program of the Chemistry Division, Balch will                   
              continue the synthesis of ligands, generally containing some                   
              phosphine binding sites, that form complexes containing                        
              clusters of metal ions.  These clusters show promise as sensors                
              for a number of toxic pollutants and as catalysts for some                     
              reactions of commercial importance.                                            
                                                                                             
              The following goals will be pursued. (1) The design and                        
              synthesis of new polyfunctional ligands for constructing                       
              transition metal complexes.  (2) To develop the coordination                   
              chemistry of these new ligands so that metal cluster forming                   
              reactions can be carried out with some degree of predictability                
              and control.  (3) The design and synthesis of new metallo-                     
              macrocycles which contain metal ions as an intrinsic part of                   
              their cyclic structure, and the exploration of the ability of                  
              these to bind inorganic and organic substances.  (4) To examine                
              the metal-metal bonding in these clusters and their electronic                 
              spectra and luminescence.  (5) To explore their use as                         
              catalysts and in organic synthesis.  (6) To initiate                           
              photochemical experiments including studies of the reactivity                  
              of excited states of these clusters.  (7)  To explore the                      
              ability of monophosphines to function as bridging ligands.
