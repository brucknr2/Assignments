Abstract    :
                   The award to SUNY Stony Brook is for the acquisition of a MIMD            
              computer to support research in a number of different application              
              areas. These include: parallel algorithms for computational fluid              
              dynamics, volume visualization architecture and algorithms,                    
              visualization tools, and combinatorial search algorithms. The                  
              computer will be used primarily to develop software that is useful             
              for computing in a MIMD environment although some codes for                    
              computational fluid dynamics will be developed and run as compute              
              intensive programs.                                                            
                   Large parallel processing computers are becoming inexpensive              
              enough that university groups can afford to purchase and maintain              
              them as a shared resource. SUNY Stony Brook is funded to purchase              
              a MIMD architecture computer to be used for computer science,                  
              computational science, and graphics and visualization research. The            
              group performing the research have a long history of using parallel            
              machines for their research and the results of previous experiences            
              with parallel computers will be invaluable in fully utilizing the              
              new computer.
