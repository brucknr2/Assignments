Abstract    :
              With funding under a Small Grant for Exploratory Research, a                   
              modeling effort will address the interaction of transverse                     
              acoustical waves on the characteristics of a turbulent flat                    
              plate boundary layer. Both standing as well as traveling waves                 
              will be considered. Model validation will be through                           
              comparison with existing experimental data for the case of                     
              interaction with longitudinal acoustic waves. In that case,                    
              significant effects on transition and heat transfer have been                  
              observed.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              Transverse waves commonly occur in combustion chambers.                        
              Acoustically driven changes in wall shear and heat transfer                    
              could be utilized for beneficial effects in combustion and                     
              cooling applications.
