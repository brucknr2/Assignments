Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This Superconducting Quantum Interference Device Magnetometer                  
              enables state-of-the-art measurements of the magnetic properties               
              of materials, under study in the Department of Physics,                        
              Department of Chemistry, and Division of Engineering at Brown                  
              University.  The flux detection system and superconducting magnet              
              are capable of measuring magnetization or susceptibility in a                  
              wide range of temperatures (1.8-400 Kelvins) and magnetic fields               
              ranging from -5.5 to +5.5 Tesla, with high sensitivity,                        
              resolution, accuracy and stability.  This instrument is                        
              particularly well suited to low magnetic fields and small                      
              samples.  Its large dynamic range also accommodates strongly                   
              ferromagnetic samples in high magnetic fields.
