Abstract    :
              This Phase II research will focus on the investigation of the                  
              refinement of the geometric and mathematical models used in                    
              conjunction with nondestructive evaluation (NDE) methods to                    
              quantify the biodegradation of wood at inaccessible locations.                 
              The emphasis will be on the prediction methodology for planes                  
              located at distances from the NDE excitation and output sensing                
              planes.  Additional research will include the quantification of                
              the effects of geometric (shape, size, check, boundary                         
              conditions) and environmental (moisture content, temperature)                  
              factors on the NDE methodology.  The data base used for model                  
              building and model verification will be greatly expanded to                    
              incorporate several species and product types.
