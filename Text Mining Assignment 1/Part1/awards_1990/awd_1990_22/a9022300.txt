Abstract    :
              Under an SBIR phase II grant, research will be carried out to                  
              further improve the configuration and performance of                           
              drag-reducing devices, developed under earlier grants, to be                   
              fitted to the back of tractor-trailers.  The effect of cross-                  
              winds, surface roughness, and further configration refinement                  
              is to be investigated.                                                         
                                                                                             
              The research may facilitate significant fuel savings in the                    
              trucking industry.
