Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This project is collaborative with SES 9022926.                            
                                                                                             
                  This research tests a theory of social control of deviance,                
                                                                                            
              the ways in which individuals can influence others not to commit               
                                                                                             
              deviant acts.  How people respond to sanctions varies greatly                  
              depending on group context.  For instance, community norms                     
              reinforce and support laws, preventing more cases of deviance                  
              than are prevented by the legal sanctions such as prison.                      
              Alternatively, peer pressure can contravene laws, as when college              
                                                                                             
              students support each others' drinking, or output norms restrict               
                                                                                             
              productivity.  The theory under test here includes both actual                 
              and perceived strength of sanctions, the cost of individual                    
              compliance, the cost and effectiveness of trying to get others to              
                                                                                             
              comply or not to comply, and the perceived likelihood that                     
              deviance will be detected.  Experiments constitute direct tests                
              of most of the theory's assertions.  Results will help develop                 
              this explicit theory on the operation of social control proces-                
              ses, and will have applications in law enforcement and informal                
              control situations.
