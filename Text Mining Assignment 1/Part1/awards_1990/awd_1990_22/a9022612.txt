Abstract    :
              This research consists of three separate, but related projects                 
              focusing on international financial institutions.  The first                   
              project will analyze the nature of the World Bank's third-world                
              debt and compare it to the debt held by commercial banks.  Among               
              the important question to be analyzed are: (1) to what extent are              
              bank loans really aid?  (2) Does the financial structure of the                
              World Bank affect the allocation of its loans across countries?                
              Is the restructuring of third world debt appropriate?  The second              
              area of research looks at the coordination of fiscal policy                    
              across countries with different electorial structures and                      
              different timing of elections.  This research will consider both               
              pressures caused by staggered elections and possible mechanisms                
              to mitigate these problems as they arise.  The final topic is an               
              analysis of how to design a central bank for a monetary union as               
              in the case of the European Monetary System.  This research is                 
              important because it will provide a better understanding of                    
              emerging financial arrangements and institutions in the third                  
              world and in Europe and how the U.S. might be affected changing                
              international financial institutions.
