Abstract    :
              The request for travel support of 13 U.S. researchers is to                    
              participate at the International Conference (of the International              
              Association) for Computer Methods and Advances in Geomechanics                 
              which will be held May 6-10, 1991 in Cairns, Queensland and                    
              Australia.  The emphasis of the conference will be the interaction             
              of computer modelling and field measurement.  This will include                
              advances in computer hardware and software and the formulation of              
              constitutive laws for geomaterials using laboratory experiments.               
              In addition the verification by field measurements will be an                  
              important topic of the conference.
