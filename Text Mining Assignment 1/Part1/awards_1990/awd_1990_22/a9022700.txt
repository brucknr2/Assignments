Abstract    :
              This award is made in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and                          
              Organometallic Chemistry Program to the University of Iowa in                  
              support of the research of Richard F. Jordan. The main theme of                
              the research is the synthesis, reaction mechanisms, and                        
              catalytic applications of electrophilic metal alkyl complexes.                 
              Such complexes are believed to be the active species in                        
              commercial Ziegler-Natta olefin polymerization catalysts.                      
                                                                                             
              Four new areas of research will be probed. (1) The structures                  
              and dynamics of agostic zirconium and hafnium alkyl complexes,                 
              (2) the mechanisms of insertion and beta-H elimination                         
              reactions of cationic complexes with emphasis on ligand                        
              structure/reactivity relationships, (3) catalytically                          
              productive ligand C-H activation/C-C coupling reactions                        
              including stereoselective reactions with chiral catalysts, and                 
              (4) the synthesis and chemistry of new electrophilic metal                     
              alkyl catalysts incorporating carborane ligands. These studies                 
              will provide new insights into the mechanisms of Ziegler-Natta                 
              catalysis, new types of C-H activation chemistry and asymmetric                
              catalysis, and new classes of electrophilic metal alkyl                        
              complexes for mechanistic studies and synthetic applications.
