Abstract    :
                The purpose of the UTSA/RCMS Program is to increase the                      
              number of well- prepared minority students who can                             
              successfully gain acceptance into the best graduate programs                   
              in mathematics, statistics, and computer science and to help                   
              to develop a strong research curriculum that will prepare                      
              students for ressarch and professional careers in these areas.                 
              To this end, UTSA will recruit and train honors minority                       
              undergraduate students.  The students will be strongly                         
              research oriented and will emphasize research opportunities                    
              for students with faculty supervisors.  The faculty                            
              participants will be asked to commit themselves to mentor                      
              relationships with students and to encourage them to pursue                    
              graduate training.                                                             
                The curriculum in each of the selected areas will be                         
              enhanced through Honors Research Seminars, Independent                         
              Research courses, a Distinguished Guest Lecturer series,                       
              off-campus summer research and special workshops which will                    
              become part of the required curriculum for all RCMS students.                  
              Each scholars with GPA>=3.0 will be selected for the program                   
              each year.
