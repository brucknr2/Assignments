Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              The objective of this project is to produce a definitive                       
              descriptive grammar of the Alabama language--a Native American                 
              language of the Muskogean family of the southeast currently                    
              spoken by several hundred people on the Alabama-Coushatta                      
              Reservation in East Texas.  The grammar will include a                         
              description of the phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax and                
              semantics, and elements of the discourse structure of the                      
              language.  Information on the language will come from the                      
              investigator's own research, conducted since 1980, and from                    
              continued field work with native speakers.  In addition,                       
              information concerning higher-level syntax, semantics, and                     
              discourse structure will come from the analysis of a number of                 
              recordings including the following: recordings made from 1957-                 
              1962 by an Alabama speaker, who elicited from elders historical                
              and cultural texts, as well as traditional myths and folktales;                
              publicly recorded speeches, possibly the first recordings of the               
              language; and my own recordings of contemporary stories, jokes,                
              and conversations.  This little-studied language is one of the                 
              few remaining aspects of the heritage of the Alabamas and the                  
              grammar will help in its preservation.  The grammar will serve as              
              a companion just to the completed Alabama Dictionary as well as                
              to a planned collections of texts.
