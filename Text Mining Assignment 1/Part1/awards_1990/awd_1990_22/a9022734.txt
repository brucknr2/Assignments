Abstract    :
              A cone and plate rheometer will be utilized in an experimental                 
              determination of shear viscosity, and the two normal stress                    
              differences, for various liquid crystal polymers (LPC).                        
              Through the capability to measure the internal pressure                        
              profile in the rheometer, it will be possible to determine the                 
              degree of homogeneity of the oriented liquid crystals                          
              throughout the strained liquid volume during the experiments.                  
                                                                                             
              The measurements will test the ability of currently used                       
              methods for determining the rheological characteristics of LPC                 
              materials, since these are based on assumed homogeneity.  The                  
              existence and extent of a homogeneous state during LCP                         
              processing is currently controversial, and resolution of this                  
              issue is important in establishing reliable means for                          
              characterizing such materials.
