Abstract    :
                   In this project the principal investigator will study a                   
              number of problems in complex analysis and potential theory.  In               
              particular, he will investigate the global behavior of solutions               
              of holomorphic Cauchy problems, the spectra of various potential               
              theoretic integral operators, the cyclicity of the shift operator              
              on Bergman spaces, and the reflection of harmonic functions in                 
              higher dimensions.  The techniques used to attack such a                       
              diversity of problems are drawn from the theory of partial                     
              differential equations, complex analysis and potential theory.                 
                   Historically the areas of mathematics known as the  theory                
              of partial differential equations and the theory of complex                    
              variables have been closely associated with each other.  Indeed                
              much of nineteenth century mathematics revolved around this                    
              relationship between partial differential equations and complex                
              variables, with each area having a profound influence on the                   
              other.  In this project the principal investigator will use this               
              symbiotic relationship between the two areas to study a number of              
              interesting problems involving harmonic functions in several                   
              space dimensions. ***//
