Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The energy gap in superfluid 3He-B is to be measured over a               
              wide range of pressure and at low T/Tc.  Ultrasound will be used to            
              measure the pair-breaking edge, 2  (P,T), in the T-- O limit, for              
              the first systematic test of the quasiclassical weak-coupling + WCP            
              theory of Serene and Raianer.  In addition, the proposed work will             
              provide a stringent self-consistency check on the WCP model and the            
              heat-capacity and phase-diagram results of Greywall.  Performing               
              the experiments in the microkelvin temperature regime will make the            
              results less sensitive to problems in theomometry compaired with               
              work at higher temperatures where very high accuracy is required.              
              Furthermore, the very-low-temperature work will permit a study of              
              the possible defects in the theoretical picture, as suggested by               
              experiments at high temperature and high pressure.  Finally, the               
              reearch requires the development of broadband acoustic techniques              
              and their extension to miocrokelvin temperatures.                              
                   This research examaines the role of quantum mechanics in                  
              determining the fundamental properties of matter through high-                 
              frequency acoustic probing of liquid 3He at temperatures less than             
              lnK above absolute zero.
