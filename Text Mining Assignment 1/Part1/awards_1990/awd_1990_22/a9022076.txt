Abstract    :
              The structure, dynamics, phase transitions, chemical reactions and             
              electronic properties of condensed systems at high pressures and               
              other extreme conditions will be investigated using techniques such            
              as Raman spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction.  Systems to be                    
              investigated include:  phase equilibria of oxygen, nitrogen and                
              sulfur, and mixtures of oxygen/nitrogen, carbon monoxide/nitrogen,             
              oxygen/argon; structures of organic and polymeric conducting                   
              materials; thermal- and photo-instabilities of simple aromatic                 
              molecules at moderate pressures.  In addition, internally heated               
              diamond-anvil cells for x-ray diffraction studies at high pressures            
              will be developed.
