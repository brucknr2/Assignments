Abstract    :
              The P.I. proposes exploratory experiments, using a new and                     
              potentially very powerful measurement technique, to elucidate the              
              phenomenon of macroscopic quantum tunneling.  The role of many-                
              body effects and the influence of an external magnetic field will              
              be explored.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              The system to be studied comprises a layer of electrons suspended              
              above a surface of liquid helium.  A modest electric field                     
              applied perpendicularly to the electron sheet forms an energy                  
              barrier that leaves an electron in a metastable state from which               
              it can escape by activation over the barrier or by tunneling                   
              through it.  The wide range of control over experimental                       
              parameters that is here available makes this an ideal system for               
              study.  To monitor the tunneling rates, some new techniques will               
              be tried, allowing direct measurement of the electron temperature              
              and density, and of the external perturbations such as electric                
              field and excitations of the He surface ("ripplons").
