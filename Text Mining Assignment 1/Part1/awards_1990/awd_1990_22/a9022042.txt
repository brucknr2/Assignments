Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Third World Congress of the International Brain Research                   
              Organization (IBRO) brings together outstanding neuroscientists                
              from all over the world for a week of symposia, lectures, and                  
              workshops in all areas of neuroscience.  It provides a valuable                
              opportunity to promote or enhance international collaborations,                
              to enrich the international dialog on current issues, and to                   
              exchange information on the latest techniques in this fast-                    
              moving, interdisciplinary field.  The Society for Neuroscience                 
              will use this support to provide funding for travel to allow                   
              young investigators, particularly for minority, women, or other                
              underrepresented groups, to take advantage of this major event                 
              to enlarge their horizons and career opportunities.
