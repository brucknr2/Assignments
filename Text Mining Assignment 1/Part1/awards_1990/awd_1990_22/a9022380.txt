Abstract    :
              Research is the field of power system modeling and simulation with             
              particular emphasis on steady-state and transient conditions,                  
              including system frequency dependence and unbalanced conditions.               
              Three projects will be pursued.  1) Development of new methods and             
              techniques for the measurements, control, and design of                        
              distribution power systems in the presence of harmonics and                    
              distortion.  This project was started by building a three-phase                
              harmonic generator and then investigating the measurement errors               
              in the induction and solid-state watt hour meters in the presence              
              of harmonics.  The experimental results were compared with the                 
              theoretical results in the induction watt hour meter.  2) Develop              
              a microprocessor-based technique to detect and locate high-                    
              impedance faults in power systems which can cause damage by fire               
              or personal injury by contact with an energized conductor.  This               
              project is started by developing a proper fault model and a                    
              measurement scheme for on-line tracking of voltages and currents               
              during such a fault.  3) Development of new techniques for optimal             
              design of harmonic filters for power systems (transmission and                 
              distribution).  The objective of these techniques are to minimize              
              harmonic distortion, to allow power factor improvement and to                  
              improve voltage regulation.  This project has been started by                  
              studying and reviewing different types of filters and their                    
              applications.
