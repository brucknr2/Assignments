Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              The P.I.:s propose to conduct an organic geochemical                           
              investigation of the flux of particulate matter in the Central                 
              Equatorial Pacific (EQPAC).  This study should allow them to                   
              reconcile water column production and sinking fluxes of the                    
              major biochemicals (lipids, amino acids, pigments, and                         
              carbohydrates) with the corresponding sediment deliver,                        
              accumulation and preservation rates, using well over 100                       
              individual organic compounds.  Major questions are:  1) What                   
              are the dynamics of particles in the surface Equatorial Pacific                
              as reflected by their organic constituents?  2) What fractions                 
              of the different biochemicals produced in the surface waters                   
              reach the deep ocean and are accumulated at the sediment-water                 
              interface?  3) What are the relative reactivities of different                 
              organic substances in the underlying sediments?  4) Do                         
              biochemical distributions differ appreciably with the inorganic                
              composition of the various sediment types along the study                      
              transect?  To address these questions the P.I.:s will sample                   
              suspended particles by insitu pumping, sinking particles using                 
              our new swimmer-exclusion traps, and bottom sediments from box                 
              cores at transect and time-series stations in coordination                     
              sampling with other EQPAC investigators.
