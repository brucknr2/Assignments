Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              The Multiple Unit Large Volume in situ Filtration System                       
              (MULVFS) will be used to study the particle dynamics and                       
              chemistry within the upper 2000 m.  MULVFS sampling provides                   
              critically needed information on the abundances, chemistry and                 
              morphology of the large particles present in the water column.                 
              It provides, in addition, a comprehensive suite of information                 
              on populations of small particles.  This approach has already                  
              resulted in major advances in the understanding of particle                    
              behavior and fluxes in the upper water column.  Sixteen MULVFS                 
              deployments will be made on spatial transect cruises from 12N                  
              to 12S at 140 W during the spring and fall of 1992.  The 640                   
              samples each divided into >53, 1-53, and <1 um particle size                   
              fractions will be analyzed for the complete suite of major and                 
              minor biogenic elements (C(organic), C(inorganic), N,P,S, Mg,                  
              K, Ca, Si, Sr) as well as for Na, A1, Fe, Mn, Cu, Ba and Pb                    
              using established methodology.  Microscopic analyses include                   
              determination of fecal pellet and amorphous aggregate size                     
              distributions and morphology.  Splits of particulate matter                    
              from drifting 'anti-swimmer' traps will be subjected to many of                
              the same analyses.
