Abstract    :
              The second half of the nineteenth century was a period of                      
              extraordinarily rapid urbanization in the United States.  The                  
              growth of cities was fueled both by the migration of the native                
              born into urban areas and by the arrival of unprecedented numbers              
              of European immigrants.  Yet, few studies have attempted to                    
              investigate the effects of urbanization on the economic welfare                
              of the population.  The purpose of this study is to close this                 
              gap by analyzing economic experiences of the populations of two                
              major cities, Boston and Chicago.  The principal source evidence               
              will be the manuscript returns of the federal censuses of                      
              population of 1850-1870.  By observing the wealth of sizeable                  
              samples of individual households in the two cities, questions in               
              three basic categories can be addressed.  First, were the cities               
              a place of unusual economic opportunity?  Second, how did                      
              immigrants fare in comparison with the native born?  And third,                
              how did the urban experience differ between the frontier and the               
              longer-settled East?  This research will lead to a much fuller                 
              understanding of the effects of urbanization on economic welfare,              
              and  to new insights into the progress of immigrants in the                    
              American economy.
