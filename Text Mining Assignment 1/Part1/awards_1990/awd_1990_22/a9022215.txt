Abstract    :
              Professor Reiss is supported by a grant from the Experimental                  
              Physical Chemistry Program for the experimental and theoretical                
              investigation of nucleation, the process by which an aggregate                 
              of molecules too small to be observed becomes the nucleus upon                 
              which other molecules condense in the vapor phase, which leads                 
              eventually to the formation of a liquid droplet.  The                          
              experiments are carried out in a cloud chamber, and the goal is                
              the understanding at the molecular level of the physical                       
              cluster itself and the physical process by which it is formed.                 
                                                                                             
              The theoretical and experimental studies in this research                      
              involve a molecular theory of vapor phase nucleation, capable                  
              of quantitative prediction of critical supersaturation for                     
              homogeneous nucleation in single and multicomponent systems                    
              under conditions of practical interest.  Studies of vapor phase                
              nucleation of vinyl polymers will be based on the same theory.                 
              The theory involves the identification of the physical cluster                 
              consistent with the physical process of nucleation and the                     
              analysis of that cluster with Monte Carlo simulation.
