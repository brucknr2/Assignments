Abstract    :
                   This award enables the Manufacturing Studies Board to create              
              a fifteen-member committee of university and industry experts in               
              the areas of materials science, industrial and mechanical                      
              engineering, and production management.  The committee will                    
              evaluate the research needs of the key technologies and processes              
              in a three-phase study.  The first phase will entail both                      
              developing a taxonomy for classifying unit processes (e.g., by                 
              physical characteristics, by industry, by product) and examining               
              the characteristics of unit processes across macro-level cross                 
              sections of the taxonomy.  The second phase will involve developing            
              criteria to determine which unit processes are critical to long-               
              term manufacturing competitiveness.  The third and final phase of              
              the study will involve an in-depth analysis of specific critical               
              processes.                                                                     
                   This two-year study will result in (1) a series of detailed               
              analyses of unit processes and their potential impact on U.S.                  
              manufacturing competitiveness and (2) the development of a                     
              comprehensive, prioritized, long-term research agenda for the                  
              National Science Foundation and the United States manufacturing                
              community in the area of unit processes.
