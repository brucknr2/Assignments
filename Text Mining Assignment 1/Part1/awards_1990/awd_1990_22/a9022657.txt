Abstract    :
              The proposed research is an extension of a SBIR Phase I research.              
              In that work, the feasibility was shown of methods for                         
              characterizing electromyographic (EMG) noise by a set of lattice               
              reflection coefficients, and for canceling EMB noise by utilizing              
              a gradient adaptive lattice (GAL) algorithm.  The thrust of the                
              research is to extend these methods to: (1) develop a recursive                
              least squares (LS) lattice adaptive joint process estimator; (2)               
              characterize non-stationary maternal EMG noise from recorded fetal             
              ECG data; (3) develop a real time implementation of the lattice LS             
              estimator based on AT&T's DSP-32 IC chip; and (4) extend the                   
              development of this recursive LS lattice J-P estimator to provide              
              a purely-order update algorithm to obtain long term stability.
