Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project examines how second generation youth (born here or                
              immigrated at least five years ago) adapt to U.S. society.  Two                
              surveys, three years apart, will be conducted of students in                   
              grades 8 and 9 in South Florida.  Those students include repre-                
              sentatives of Cuban, Haitian, West Indian, and Central and South               
              American immigrant groups.  Differences in success of adaptation,              
              and in the processes through which it occurs, are expected, and                
              will be linked to aspects of the social context encountered by                 
              children in each group.  The study focuses upon family history,                
              socio-economic background, employment status, language skills and              
              usage, acculturation, self identity, career aspirations, school                
              adjustment, and educational attainment.  Results have implica-                 
              tions for theories of socialization, language acquisition,                     
              mobility, and cultural change.
