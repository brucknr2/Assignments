Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Dakota State University is establishing a connection to NSFNET via             
              a 56,000 bits per second line through the MIDNET mid-level network.            
                                                                                             
              The connection enhances collaborations of campus scientists with               
              colleagues at other institutions, and allows access to libraries               
              and other remote facilities throughout the internet.  This award               
              funds part of the costs for two years.***//
