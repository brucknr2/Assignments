Abstract    :
                   Two research projects will be supported by the acquisition of             
              a high resolution graphics display terminal. The first is three                
              dimensional modeling of the brain from two dimensional tomographic             
              slices. The second is the simulation of numerically controlled tool            
              paths for a five axis machine center. The display terminal will                
              provide a needed visualization tool.                                           
                   High resolution graphics terminals are necessary in order to              
              see what one is computing. The equipment provided by this grant                
              will give two research groups the needed visualization capability.             
              The first group will use the terminal to map out, in three                     
              dimensions, functional structures of the human brain using data                
              from tomographic studies. The second group will use the terminal to            
              examine, under simulation, the machining of metal parts.
