Abstract    :
              Agitation and air-sparging are necessary for providing                         
              oxygen and other nutrients to dense populations of                             
              cultured animal cells.  Understanding the injury of                            
              fragile animal cells due to fluid-mechanical forces is an                      
              important issue to the culturing of these cells in                             
              bioreactors of various scales and for various                                  
              applications.  The Principal Investigator (PI) proposes to                     
              investigate the factors that effect the forces experienced                     
              by cells due to bubble break-up.  Bubble-column and                            
              agitated bioreactors will be used to study the effect of                       
              operational parameters and medium composition on cell                          
              injury.  Video microscopy will be employed to visualize                        
              and quantitate some aspects of cell to bubble                                  
              interactions.  The PI also proposes to investigate sparger                     
              and impeller designs that will allow the sparging and                          
              mixing of cells in bioreactors.
