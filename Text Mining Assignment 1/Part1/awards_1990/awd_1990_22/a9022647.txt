Abstract    :
                   The spectroscopy of molecular ions is studied (1) to                      
              obtain quantum mechanical information on the fundamental                       
              species, in particular on their intramolecular dynamics, (2)                   
              to provide astronomers with laboratory spectra for their                       
              searches in space, and (3) to study chemistry and physics of                   
              laboratory plasmas.  Current objectives include:  extending                    
              spectroscopic measurements on H3+; searching for H3+ in Saturn                 
              and Uranus, and for other ionic spectra in Jupiter; carrying                   
              out spectroscopy and analysis of carbo-ions (CH5+, CH4+, CH3+                  
              etc); studying proton tunneling in C2 H3+ and CH5; and                         
              developing double resonance ion spectroscopy in molecular                      
              systems.
