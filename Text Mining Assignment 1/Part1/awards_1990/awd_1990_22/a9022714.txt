Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A hybrid (combining passive with active)                                       
              control system will be developed that                                          
              incorporates a refined stochastic finite                                       
              element method for the optimal control of                                      
              buildings, bridges and other complex shell                                     
              structures such as domes, towers, tanks and                                    
              chimneys, with uncertain structural                                            
              parameters and which can be exposed to random                                  
              dynamic wind loads.  The structural                                            
              uncertainties are assumed as random in space.                                  
              The wind loads are assumed as random in both                                   
              time space.  This development may also be                                      
              applied to earthquake loads.  The goal is to                                   
              develop a hybrid control system that                                           
              significantly improves the reliability and                                     
              safety of complex structures subjected to                                      
              extreme random loads produced by certain                                       
              natural hazards.
