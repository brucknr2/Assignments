Abstract    :
              This award is for the acquisition of a distributed memory MIMD                 
              computer to support research across several disciplines.  These                
              areas include:  load balancing by task partitioning on MIMD                    
              computers, development of distributed algorithms for Quantum Monte             
              Carlo algorithms applied to thermodynamic problems, finite element             
              methods for modeling nuclear waste repositories, groundwater                   
              quality modeling, and adaptive algorithms for modeling sub-particle            
              interactions.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              The development of parallel computers is lowering the cost of super            
              computer performance machines.  Many universities can now do                   
              scientific computing in a number of application areas that required            
              super computers in the past.  Western Michigan University has                  
              developed expertise in the use of Multiple Instruction Multiple                
              Data computers.  The acquisition of this computer will benefit                 
              scientific research in computer science, physics, ecology, and                 
              numerical analysis.
