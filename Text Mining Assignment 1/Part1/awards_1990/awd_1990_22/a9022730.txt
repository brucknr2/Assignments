Abstract    :
                   The primary goal of this research is the study of the                     
              invariants for a class of torsion-free Abelian groups of finite                
              rank known as the Butler groups. The invariants are to be examined             
              concurrently in the context of representations of finite partially             
              ordered sets.  A study of Coxeter correspondences and almost split             
              sequences is included in the project with the aim of expanding the             
              menu of potentially classifiable groups and representations.                   
                   The research is in the general area of algebra and is                     
              concerned with the structure theory of infinite groups having a                
              commutative multiplicative structure - the Abelian groups.  These              
              groups arise in a variety of settings in algebra, geometry, and                
              analysis.  This research concerns the classification of invariants             
              for selected families of these Abelian groups in anticipation of               
              obtaining a general structure theory.
