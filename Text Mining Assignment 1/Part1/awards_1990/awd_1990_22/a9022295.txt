Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              This research will test the hypothesis that phytoplankton                      
              growth in the central equatorial Pacific is limited by a                       
              deficiency of iron that results from the very low input of                     
              iron-rich atmospheric dust in this area far removed from                       
              terrestrial dust sources.   It is estimated that the                           
              phytoplankton only have 10-20% of the iron they need to fully                  
              utilize the nitrate and phosphate upwelling to the surface;                    
              hence the potential productivity of a billion tons of C per                    
              year is far from being realized.  Dissolved and particulate                    
              iron in the water column will be measured in which effects on                  
              chlorophyll synthesis and nitrate will uptake will be observed                 
              with and without added iron.                                                   
                                                                                             
              This effort will also provide support to the overall U.S. JGOFS                
              Equatorial Pacific Study by providing clean water and                          
              containers to others testing alternative hypotheses.  Samples                  
              will be collected for measurements of dissolved organic C and N                
              using high temperature catalytic oxidation techniques.
