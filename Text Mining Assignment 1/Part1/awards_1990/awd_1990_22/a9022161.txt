Abstract    :
              Computing Research is a very young research area.  In the past few             
              years it has become clear that computation is joining experimentation          
              and mathematical analysis, providing a basic new scientific paradigm           
              for how science gets done.  In such a new and rapidly changing field,          
              communication among researchers is particularly important.  But the            
              conference structure in computer science and engineering is highly             
              fragmented and works against such communication.  Important new                
              research results are seldom presented at broad based national                  
              meetings.  Consequently, broad based meetings are seldom attended by           
              active researchers.                                                            
                                                                                             
              A Federated Computing Research Conference is planned to address this           
              problem.  This conference will retain the advantages of smaller                
              specialized meetings while at the same time facilitating communication         
              among researchers in different subfields.  Additional benefits of this         
              meeting include:  (1) economies of scale, (2) providing an educational         
              function for the public, (3) stimulating new research.  Planning for           
              this conference will consist of developing discussions and consensus           
              within the computing research community as well as careful planning of         
              site selection and other arrangements.  Most of the administrative             
              effort in this planning will be carried out by a steering committee of         
              prominent members of the research community.
