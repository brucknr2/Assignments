Abstract    :
              This is an award for Phase II of the development of an American                
              Sign Language (ASL) acquisition, recognition and translation                   
              system.  Such a system could eventually allow deaf signers and                 
              English speaking individuals to communicate without the aid of a               
              human interpreter.  The Phase II research focuses on several                   
              critical capabilities:  (1) the quantification of ASL as a                     
              spatial/visual language; (2) the acquisition of ASL for internal               
              use by a computer; (3) the recognition of dynamic ASL gestures;                
              and (4) the context-sensitive translation between ASL and                      
              English.  A proof-of-concept prototype will be built.  Machine                 
              translation algorithms for ASL-to-English will be developed.                   
              Potential intermediate products include:  gestural interfaces for              
              computers and home appliances, telerobotic controllers, virtual                
              reality and simulations tools, and ASL research tools.
