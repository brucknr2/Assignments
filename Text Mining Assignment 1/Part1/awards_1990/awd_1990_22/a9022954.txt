Abstract    :
                   The Ichthyology Collection of the California Academy of                   
              Sciences contains more than 200,000 lots of specimens, and                     
              includes historically important collections that have been                     
              transferred from Stanford and Indiana Universities, and from the               
              George Vanderbilt Foundation.  Drs. Tomio Iwamoto and William                  
              Eschmeyer, Curators in charge of the Collection, have embarked on              
              a plan to computerize all specimen lots, in order to make them                 
              more readily available to the research community.  They plan to                
              begin with data entry for freshwater fishes from South America,                
              and this will add important data to a multi-institution                        
              international database project supported by the National Science               
              Foundation, coordinated by Dr. Scott Schaefer of the Academy of                
              Natural Sciences in Philadelphia.                                              
                   The proposed database of South American fishes is an                      
              unprecedented effort to link separate databases of museum                      
              specimens to create a wide-area network with open access to                    
              researchers.  Once completed, the database will be a unique and                
              heavily used resource for systematic, evolutionary, ecological,                
              and biogeographic research.
