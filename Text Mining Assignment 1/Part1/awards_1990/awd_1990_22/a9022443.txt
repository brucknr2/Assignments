Abstract    :
                   The American Statistical Association (ASA) proposes to                    
              consolidate separate ASA/NSF Fellowship Programs with the                      
              Bureau of Census (Census),  Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS),                  
              and the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES)  into                  
              a single program.  This program bridges the gap between                        
              academic scholars and government social science research.                      
              Research Fellows and Associates will work on methodological                    
              problems and policy issues in a Federal statistical agency;                    
              government social scientists in turn will work with the                        
              visiting scholars to gain expertise in applying theoretical                    
              advancements to their work.  Residence at the agencies allows                  
              for research impossible without direct day-to-day access to                    
              the Federal agencies' data and human capital resources.  In                    
              addition,  the proposed consolidation will allow researchers                   
              to work in more than one agency,  stimulating new research                     
              applicable to a wide spectrum of statistical programs.                         
                   Historically,  Federal statistical agencies have                          
              realized significant benefits from on-site research conducted                  
              by ASA/NSF Fellows and Associates.  Basic scientific                           
              knowledge also has advanced through the continued                              
              investigation of methodological and analytical problems                        
              growing out of their "hands-on" experience with these                          
              agencies.  The planned consolidation of the three original                     
              Fellowship programs -  Census,  BLS and NCES -  promises to                    
              enhance the yield of the overall project,  while at the same                   
              time reducing its cost of operation.
