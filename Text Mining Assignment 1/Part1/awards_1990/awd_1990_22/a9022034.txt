Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The National Research Council (NRC) will continue its                          
              activities in support of the U.S. Global Change Research                       
              Program and related international research programs, through                   
              its Committee on Global Change Research (CGCR).  This Committee                
              will advise Federal agencies through the interagency Committee                 
              on Earth and Environmental Sciences (CEES) Working Group on                    
              Global Change on scientific planning for the U.S. Global Change                
              Research Program.  The CGCR will: (1) formulate scientific                     
              recommendations for coordinating the U.S. Global Change                        
              Research Program with internationally planned activities; (2)                  
              provide liaison between international and U.S. planning                        
              efforts by serving as the U.S. national committee for the                      
              international programs on global change; and (3) hold                          
              frequent meetings with representative of the CEES Working Group                
              on Global Change to assure coordination of NRC activities and                  
              to communicate science needs of the U.S. Global Change Research                
              Program.  The CGCR will coordinate its activities with those of                
              other NAS/NRC boards and committees working in related areas,                  
              and will develop a comprehensive NAS/NRC proposal, to be                       
              submitted to the Federal agencies for FY 1992 funding, that                    
              will encompass all NAS/NRC activities undertaken primarily for                 
              issues related to global change.
