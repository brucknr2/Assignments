Abstract    :
                   In this study the aurora will be viewed from Godhavan,                    
              Greenland (near the magnetic meridiana distance ~290km northwest               
              of Sondre Stromfjord, Greenland) with an imaging spectrometer.                 
              Simultaneously the incoherent scatter radar and other optical                  
              instruments will view the same aurora in the magnetic zenith at                
              Sondre Stromfjord.  The method provides measurements of source                 
              emission intensities versus altitude, while simultaneous                       
              measurements of the particle beam is made with the radar.  The                 
              first scientific objective is a study of electron beam versus                  
              emission heights.  Studies of auroral arcs and thermospheric                   
              effects will also be performed.  Two winter campaign periods are               
              planned.  A dedicated two week "aeronomy" campaign is planned                  
              where the radar will be predominantly operated looking up the                  
              magentic field.  Operation is also planned for two additional                  
              two-week, low moon, periods with "shared" radar time.  The first               
              campaign will concentrate on the 420-800 nm spectral region.                   
              Height distributions of the entire spectrum will be measured.                  
              The spectral region for the second campaign will evolve from the               
              results of the first.
