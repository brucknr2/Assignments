Abstract    :
              This project is an effort to collect temperature, salinity, and                
              oxygen content measurements from the Swedish icebreaker ODEN as                
              part of the International Arctic Ocean Expedition-91, a three-                 
              ship oceanographic investigation of the eastern Arctic Ocean.                  
              The cruise track will cross the Nansen, Makarov and Amundsen                   
              Basins, and represents one of the infrequent opportunities to                  
              obtain basin-scale deep ocean sections in the Arctic.                          
              Hydrographic data to World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE)                 
              standards is basic to an understanding of the circulation of the               
              Arctic Ocean, as well as providing the physical framework for the              
              complementary oceanographic projects that will be carried out on               
              the three ships.
