Abstract    :
                   This project will provide support for planning activities to              
              launch the Curriculum Action Project of the Mathematical                       
              Association of America (MAA).  This project is a comprehensive                 
              national effort to stimulate and amplify efforts to strengthen                 
              the mathematical sciences at the undergraduate level.  The                     
              primary objective of the planning period is to develop and                     
              disseminate an intellectual agenda for undergraduate mathematics               
              that can guide the National Science Foundation, the MAA, and the               
              broader mathematical community.  A secondary objective is to                   
              initiate a broad-based dialogue about this agenda both within the              
              mathematics community and with the many external constituencies                
              whose own efforts are loosely linked to collegiate mathematics.                
                   The project's long-term goals are to promote curriculum                   
              reform; to identify and publicize examples of effective                        
              innovation; to reshape faculty attitudes; to improve quantitative              
              literacy; and to align assessment with appropriate curriculum                  
              objectives.  The MAA will convene a series of focus groups to                  
              help identify issues and recommendations, will enlist its twenty-              
              nine regional sections to initiate grass-root discussions, and                 
              will prepare a report for wide distribution.  The MAA plans to                 
              extend this project in subsequent years to help promote                        
              widespread implementation of effective approaches to collegiate                
              mathematics.
