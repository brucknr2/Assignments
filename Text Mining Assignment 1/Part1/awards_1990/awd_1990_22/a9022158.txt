Abstract    :
              The Principal Investigators (PIs)                                              
              seek to address the issue of                                                   
              micromixing (mixing on the scale of                                            
              the biological cell) and                                                       
              micro-segregation of reactants.  Do                                            
              these factors produce a biological                                             
              response in a growing cell?  Do                                                
              they cause changes in cell yield                                               
              and the production of secondary                                                
              metabolites?  The ultimate                                                     
              objective is to advance engineering                                            
              science to the stage where                                                     
              micromixing can be used as a design                                            
              parameter in the design of                                                     
              fermenters.
