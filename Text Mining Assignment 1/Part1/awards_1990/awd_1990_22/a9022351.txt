Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator undertakes to develop a                        
              state-of-the-art software package to compute unsteady, chemically              
              reacting, two-phase, viscous flows in and around objects of complex            
              shape.                                                                         
                   Such fluid flow problems arise in aerodynamics,                           
              for example in describing airflow past wings                                   
              or around entire planes or missiles.                                           
              Another area of applications involves the study and design                     
              of internal-combustion engines, jet engines, and turbines.                     
              In each of these applications highly accurate simulations                      
              are desirable but expensive to calculate.                                      
              The software package to be developed is intended to include                    
              accurate and efficient numerical algorithms,                                   
              and to cover applications of existing gas dynamics programs                    
              and Navier-Stokes (fluid flow) programs.
