Abstract    :
                   Dimension driven Computer Aided Design (CAD) systems hold                 
              great promise for enhancing productivity and competitiveness of                
              the early conceptual stages of mechanical engineering design.                  
              Current systems suffer one of two sets of deficiencies.                        
              Variational Geometry systems suffer from speed problems and                    
              problems controlling which solutions their geometry solution                   
              mechanism converges to.  Constructional or "parametric" systems,               
              while fast, have a less intuitive user interface and a less                    
              flexible geometry representation.  The objective of the research               
              is to develop a new graph-theory based technique to convert a                  
              variational geometry description to a constructional system.                   
              Preliminary research in two-dimensions has indicated the prospect              
              of dramatically increasing the speed of variational geometry                   
              solution, and thus increasing the range of problems to which it                
              may be applied.  Successful implementation in a mechanical design              
              package will greatly expand the utility of conceptual design                   
              software to the mechanical engineer.
