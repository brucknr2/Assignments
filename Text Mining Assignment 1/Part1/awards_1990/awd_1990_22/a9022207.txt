Abstract    :
              The testicular feminization mutation (Tfm) occurs in rats, mice,               
              cattle, chimpanzee and humans.  The mutation is carried on the X-              
              chromosome and all males carrying this mutation exhibits the                   
              phenotype which is the insensitivity to the hormone, androgens.                
              Studies of Tfm mutation have provided us with insights on the                  
              mode of action of androgens, particularly the interaction between              
              the hormone and CNS proteins.                                                  
                                                                                             
              The GW group maintains the only known colony of Tfm rats and                   
              serves as an invaluable resource for the research community.
