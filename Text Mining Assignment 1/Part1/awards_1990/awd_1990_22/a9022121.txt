Abstract    :
                This grant will fund urgently needed support through the SGER                
              program to analyze the June 20, 1990, earthquake in northern                   
              Iran.  The principal investigator has obtained a unique data set               
              of 33 measurements of peak ground acceleration recorded within                 
              100 km of the source.  This data set is unique because the flow                
              of technical information from that country is extremely slow due               
              to restrictions imposed on travel and field investigation in                   
              Iran.  The scientific community outside Iran is eager to learn                 
              about the behavior of the ground-motion generated in the near-                 
              source region and the lessons to be learned from this earthquake.              
              The attenuation of peak ground acceleration with distance and                  
              orientation will be analyzed and compared with other regions of                
              the world.  This research is a component of the National                       
              Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
