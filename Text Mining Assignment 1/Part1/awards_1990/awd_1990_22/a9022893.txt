Abstract    :
                   Wellesley College has supported a herbarium for more than a               
              century, and the Wellesley lichen collections are historically                 
              important for systematic and ecological research.  Recent changes              
              in the composition of the biology faculty at Wellesley have left               
              the herbarium without an appropriate curator.  The College                     
              decided to discontinue its support for the herbarium in the late               
              1980's, and in 1988 the collection (70,000 vascular plants and                 
              20,000 cryptogams) was transferred to the New York Botanical                   
              Garden (NYBG).  Dr. J. Kallunki, Curator at NYBG, proposes to                  
              repair specimens, transfer them to new sheets and folders, and                 
              integrate them into the Garden's herbarium.                                    
                   Systematic collections such as the Wellesley herbarium are                
              critical resources for the study of biological diversity.  The                 
              long-term maintenance and growth of natural history collections                
              are essential for future generations of research.  The New York                
              Botanical Garden's willingness to incorporate the Wellesley                    
              herbarium will protect it from an uncertain future, and will make              
              it available to the research community in a timely fashion.
