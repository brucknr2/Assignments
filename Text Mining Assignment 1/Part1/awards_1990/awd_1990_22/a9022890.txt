Abstract    :
              This project is an investigation into the circulation of the                   
              deep basins of the Arctic Ocean using chemical tracers                         
              supported by closely spaced hydrographic sections.  Oceanic                    
              tracers are extremely useful in assessing how the large-                       
              scale circulation maintains the hydrographic structure and                     
              the arctic sea ice cover, and in estimating the exchange of                    
              water between the Arctic Ocean and its marginal seas.  This                    
              project will collect, measure, and evaluate the tritium,                       
              helium isotopes, oxygen-18, and carbon-14 concentration in                     
              sea water on transects in the European Basin as part of the                    
              International Arctic Ocean Expedition 1991, a three-ship                       
              expedition.  Small volume sampling will be carried out on                      
              the Swedish icebreaker ODEN, while large-volume sampling                       
              will be done from the German research ship POLARSTERN.  The                    
              proposed combination of tracers will allow the establishing                    
              of renewal time scales for both deep and shallow water                         
              masses.  Additionally, the pattern of tracers in deep basins                   
              will give indications of the origin of these deep water                        
              masses and the processes by which they were formed.
