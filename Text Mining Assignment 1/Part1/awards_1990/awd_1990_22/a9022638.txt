Abstract    :
              The research proposes to investigate the behavior of                           
              marine clays under large strains with wave and tsunami                         
              loading.  The wave induced forces have been continuously                       
              transporting soft sediments from shallow water depths to                       
              deeper parts of the ocean.  It is proposed to examine the                      
              stability of the marine clays by subjecting them to                            
              similar stress paths and damage caused by the waves.  A                        
              special testing device will be used to subject the clays                       
              to circular stress paths which can not be applied in                           
              conventional available apparatuses.  Additional tests are                      
              proposed to relate plasticity index, over consolidation                        
              ratio and anisotropy of clay to coefficients of                                
              permeability.  Finally an effort will be made to develop                       
              or modify an incremental plastic model which can simulate                      
              the effect of rotation of principal stress direction.
