Abstract    :
              The aim of the research project is to investigate the way in which             
              financial and ownership structure of the manufacturing sector in               
              the United States affects the pursuit of long term investment                  
              goals, in particular, the development of new products and                      
              processes.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              Three different empirical studies are conducted. First, a model of             
              simultaneous choice of investment and financial policy is outlined,            
              which can be used to investigate the effect of liquidity                       
              constraints on research and development investment (or ordinary                
              investment) at the firm level. Second, additional work will be                 
              undertaken that looks into the sources of gain from merger,                    
              leveraged buyout or other "going private" transactions using a                 
              discrete choice model of exit which also incorporates the value of             
              the transaction as measured by its price. Third, the same model is             
              used to construct predictions of takeover probability which can                
              serve as a screen to identify potentially undervalued firms.                   
              Examination of the returns to the equities of such firms (for those            
              which are not subsequently acquired) provides a partial test of the            
              hypothesis of market myopia or undervaluation of long-term                     
              investment.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              An important part of the project involves updating a dataset                   
              constructed during a previous NSF grant which consists of balance              
              sheets and income statements as well as exit information for                   
              approximately 2700 manufacturing firms from 1959 through 1987. This            
              dataset has been widely used by researchers in the economics                   
              profession.
