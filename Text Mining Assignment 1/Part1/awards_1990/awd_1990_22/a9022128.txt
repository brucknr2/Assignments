Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award, to a leading young instrumentalist, supports research              
              on the structure of high-velocity gas flows in a variety of                    
              astrophysical situations.  It utilizes a very high resolution                  
              imaging Fabry-Perot spectrophotometer developed by the Principal               
              Investigator.  This work will provide novel constraints on the                 
              dynamics of ionized filaments in the circumnuclear regions of                  
              active galaxies and improve the general physical understanding of              
              high-velocity radiative shocks.
