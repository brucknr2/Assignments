Abstract    :
              This project is concerned with establishing some of the econometric            
              theory for predicting from models involving time dependent                     
              conditional variances. Specifically, the intention is to examine               
              the form of the optimal predictor of the conditional mean and the              
              conditional variance equations; their mean squared error (MSE) and             
              their associated multi-step prediction density. Initial work that              
              has been undertaken has given rise to analytic expressions for all             
              the moments of the conditional mean prediction density from a                  
              univariate autocorrelated process with GARCH (1,1) innovations. The            
              project will extend these results for more general processes and               
              will attempt to derive some fairly general results for the                     
              prediction of future conditional variances. It is anticipated that             
              there will be many applications of these results in asset pricing              
              models and option pricing models, where prediction of future                   
              volatility is likely to be important an important component of the             
              asset price. Applications will also be made to the relationship                
              between stock market indices and the real business cycle.
