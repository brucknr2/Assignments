Abstract    :
              This project investigates the use of ultra-violet light to modify              
              on-chip voltages.  Analog quantities in on-chip long term storage              
              can be used to compensate for fabrication variations and to provide            
              variable synapses in neural networks.  The voltage on floating                 
              gates in a standard CMOS integrated circuit (IC) can be set by                 
              shining uniform ultra-violet light on the chip and arranging the               
              circuit geometry so that nearby active areas have the correct                  
              voltages.  The use of ultra-violet light to set the weights on                 
              synapses in a Hopfield style neural network is being investigated.             
              Research tasks include: (1) refine the basic circuit model through             
              experimentation; (2) measure cycle lifetimes on circuits with a                
              faster settling time; (3) investigate electrical methods of                    
              controlling charge on floating gates; (4) fabricate, test and                  
              refine a pattern recognition chip with floating node storage of                
              synapse weights; and (5) identify and test circuits suitable for               
              distribution as layout libraries.
