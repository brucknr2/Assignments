Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              Problem III of the EqPac Science Plan states that new                          
              production is less than expected in the central equatorial                     
              Pacific for the levels of primary production and nutrient                      
              concentrations observed.  The explanation may lie in the rates                 
              and mechanisms of particle cycling.  The P.I,'s propose to                     
              participate in the survey cruises in the central equatorial                    
              Pacific at 140oW, to deploy an array of floating sediment traps                
              at each station and to measure the fluxes of: 1. total mass; 2.                
              particulate carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus (POC, PN, PP); 3.                  
              chlorophyll and phaeopigments; 4. particle reactive                            
              radiotracers:  234Th, 210Pb and 210Po; 5. major phase elements:                
              Al, Sr, Ca, Mg, and Sr; 6. stable tracer elements: Fe, Mn, Pb,                 
              Ba, Cd, Cu, and Zn.  The P.I.'s will also collect and analyze                  
              dissolved and particulate water column samples for 234Th, 210Pb                
              and 210Po.
