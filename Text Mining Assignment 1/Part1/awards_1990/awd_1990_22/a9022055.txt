Abstract    :
              Dr. Victoria Buch is supported by a grant from the Theoretical                 
              and Computational Chemistry Program to perform theoretical                     
              studies of the vibrational spectra of isotopic ice mixtures.                   
              These studies will provide a more detailed understanding of the                
              unusual structural properties of amorphous and crystalline ice.                
                                                                                             
              In this research Dr. Buch will perform theoretical studies of                  
              the vibrational spectra of amorphous ice which is obtained by                  
              slow condensation of the vapor at temperatures below 100K.                     
              Under these conditions the condensing water molecules are                      
              insufficiently mobile to relax into their thermodynamically                    
              more stable crystalline ice form.  Amorphous ice therefore                     
              provides an attractive model for a glass whose microscopic                     
              structure is controlled by condensation kinetics rather than by                
              thermodynamics.  Dr. Buch will use a combination of computer                   
              simulations and analytical theory to compare the vibrational                   
              properties of this type of amorphous ice with those of                         
              crystalline (cubic) ice.  As an additional goal of this                        
              research, an improved flexible potential for condensed water                   
              will be constructed, and used to analyze the vibrations of both                
              amorphous and cubic ice.
