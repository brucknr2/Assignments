Abstract    :
              In many problems, information is available from many different                 
              sources.  Aggregating these diverse bits of information is                     
              important to good decision-making but also leads to special                    
              statistical problems in developing models to characterize the                  
              information.  Prior research in this areas has relied primarily                
              on the use of historical data as a basis for modelling the                     
              information sources.  The proposed research develops a Bayesian                
              framework that a decision maker can use to encode his subjective               
              knowledge about the information sources in order to aggregate                  
              their information.  This framework features a highly flexible                  
              environment for modelling the probabilistic nature and                         
              interrelationships of the information sources and requires                     
              straightforward and intuitive subjective judgements using proven               
              decision-analytic assessment techniques. Analysis of the                       
              assessments to produce a posterior distribution for the event of               
              interest is accomplished through analytical, numerical or Monte                
              Carlo techniques.
