Abstract    :
              The goal of this research is to understand the economic factors                
              producing different policy outcomes in open economies, and to                  
              evaluate in a quantitative fashion the implications for global                 
              welfare of the increasing integration of world financial markets.              
              To further the first component of this plan, the project studies               
              game-theoretic models of discretionary policymaking, assuming that             
              the private sector has rational expectations.  Central issues                  
              include the possibility of default on public debt and the role of              
              currency devaluation in financial crises.  The second component of             
              the work calculates measures of the gains to countries from the                
              ability to pool country-specific risks internationally, and to                 
              borrow and lend.  Linkages between international capital mobility              
              and long-run economic growth rates will also be studied.                       
                                                                                             
              This project has the potential to explain certain empirical                    
              features of international capital markets.  In addition, the                   
              findings are relevant for judging the likely benefits of measure               
              to integrate capital markets further - such as the current                     
              initiatives within the European Community - or the costs of                    
              measures to restrict capital movements, which sometimes are                    
              proposed on macroeconomic grounds.
