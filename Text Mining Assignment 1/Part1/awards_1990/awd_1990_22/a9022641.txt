Abstract    :
              The Gordon Conference on the Physics and Chemistry of Laser                    
              Diagnostics in Combustion is to be held in Plymouth, New                       
              Hampshire, July 15-19, 1991.  Invited speakers from government                 
              laboratories, universities, and industry will lead discussions                 
              on the applications of the latest theories and techniques in                   
              laser diagnostics to combustion systems.  Topics will include                  
              various spectroscopic techniques (Raman, LIF, CARS), high                      
              intensity resonant interactions, turbulence-combustion                         
              interactions, quantitative imaging, diagnostics in                             
              supercritical oxidation and hypersonic combustors, and                         
              measuring surface film growth.                                                 
                                                                                             
              The Thermal Systems Program has partially sponsored these                      
              biennial gatherings over the past few years because the                        
              structure of the conference lends itself to a strong                           
              interchange of ideas among the combustion laser diagnostics                    
              community, with experienced practitioners and postdoctoral                     
              students, academic and industrial researchers, and foreign and                 
              US scientists participating.
