Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The relationship between democracy and economic growth is among the            
              most important but poorly understood in the field of political                 
              economy. Are democracy and economic growth compatible?  Or is the              
              sacrifice of personal freedom a necessary price people must pay to             
              escape poverty?  The central question of this project is whether               
              democracy promotes, impedes, or is irrelevant to economic                      
              development. However, because economic development probably also               
              influences the development of democracy, the study also considers              
              the effects of growth on democracy.                                            
                                                                                             
              This project examines the reciprocal influences between democracy              
              and development using advanced statistical methods and aggregate               
              data on a cross section of the world's nation states since 1945.               
              When completed, the study should help us understand whether there              
              are any conditions under which authoritarian governments are                   
              superior to democracies in producing wealth for their citizens and             
              whether there is some minimum level of economic development that               
              is necessary for the establishment of stable democratic rule. These            
              questions are particularly urgent today as attempts to establish               
              or re-establish democracy are occurring in numerous countries                  
              around the world, including especially in eastern Europe.
