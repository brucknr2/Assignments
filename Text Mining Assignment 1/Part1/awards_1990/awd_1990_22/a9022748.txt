Abstract    :
              This project investigates three aspects of long-run economic                   
              growth: first, the shape of comparative growth over the past                   
              century, second, the extent to which broad asset price indices -               
              predominantly stock market indices - forecast actual or expected               
              future economic growth, and third, possible lessons on the links               
              between financial structure and growth taught by the comparison of             
              Great Britain and the United States at the turn of the twentieth               
              century.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              All three parts of this project will extend in significant ways the            
              baseline of information economists have to draw conclusions about              
              the relationship between the structure and performance of financial            
              markets and the shape of long-run growth.  Most importantly, the               
              first part of the proposal - the improvement, extension and                    
              analysis of the long term data - will generate a new database.                 
              This new database would provide a better picture of the shape of               
              productivity advance in the industrial core of the world economy               
              and diffusion to the periphery of new settlement over the past                 
              century.  It would also provide more accurate and reliable data for            
              future studies of the determinants of long-run growth.
