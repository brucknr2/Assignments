Abstract    :
                   A Phase II program is proposed to complete the research                   
              required to develop a new and innovative type of borehole logging              
              tool for measuring the bulk density of geological formations.  This            
              tool uses a linear induction accelerator (LIA) to generate an                  
              intense x-ray beam which is scattered from the formation.                      
              Detectors placed near the accelerator sense Compton-scattered                  
              photons thereby providing a direct measure of density.                         
                   Experimental evaluations of key LIA components and the                    
              conceptual design for a LIA-based x-ray tool were successfully                 
              completed in Phase I.  The proposed Phase II program will complete             
              the feasibility assessment of this new and innovative logging                  
              concept by constructing and testing a laboratory prototype tool.
