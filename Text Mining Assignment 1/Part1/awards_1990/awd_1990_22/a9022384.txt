Abstract    :
              Several key results were obtained in the Phase I study                         
              of an efficient acousto-optic resonator for GHz laser                          
              mode locking.  The results indicate that lithium                               
              niobate is one of the best resonator materials.  We                            
              believe that fabrication techniques can limit resonator                        
              gain at the higher frequencies.  This study also                               
              verified the closed loop electronic driver approach                            
              which worked well for lamp pumped lasers with cavity                           
              frequency below 200 MHz.  The diode pumped laser                               
              mode locking pulse width produced varied from 8 to                             
              13 picoseconds and appeared to be more stable when                             
              the cavity is shortened.                                                       
                                                                                             
              Phase II of the study will continue the work begun in                          
              Phase I.  We have improved our fabrication                                     
              techniques and will construct a higher gain resonator.                         
              The electronic driver concept will also be                                     
              implemented at the higher frequency.  Through joint                            
              activities with laser companies, we will determine the                         
              most stable cavity length of mode locked diode                                 
              pumped lasers.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              At the conclusion of this study, working mode locked                           
              systems that can provide stable pulses less than 10                            
              picoseconds wide will be completed for diode pumped                            
              lasers and for tunable solid state lasers.
