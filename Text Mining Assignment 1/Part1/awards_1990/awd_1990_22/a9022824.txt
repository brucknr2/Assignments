Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research examines the recrystallization kinetics in metal                 
              alloys that have second phase particles.  Some alloys containing               
              fine particles can display behavior changing from suppression to               
              retardation to acceleration of recrystallization with increasing               
              plastic strain.  This study centers on the pinning forces that can             
              occur from particles during primary recrystallization.  The                    
              experimental results will be compared to a model formulated to                 
              explain the recrystallization kinetics.  Calorimetry and                       
              transmission electron microscopy are employed to follow the                    
              underlying mechanisms associated with the recrystallization                    
              process.  The research contributes to an understanding of                      
              recrystallization processes in metal alloys and should result in a             
              quantitative model of the effect of small, hard particles on                   
              recrystallization kinetics.  This information will provide greater             
              control of alloy microstructure during processing.
