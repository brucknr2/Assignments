Abstract    :
              The upwelling of nutrients in Equatorial Pacific waters enhances               
              plankton biomass and primary production over a large area and                  
              may account for a significant fraction of the global new                       
              production.  Nitrate persists in the euphotic zone in an area a                
              few hundred kilometers north and south of the upwelling axis and               
              several hypotheses have been advanced to account for the apparent              
              inability of the phytoplankton to fully utilize it. This project               
              hypothesizes that grazing controls phytoplankton biomass and that              
              recycling of nutrients provides much of the phytoplankton                      
              nitrogen requirement.                                                          
                                                                                             
              This study will utilize new techniques which have been applied                 
              over the last few years in the Sargasso Sea and the JGOFS North                
              Atlantic Bloom Experiment to test the grazing/regeneration                     
              hypothesis as part of the U.S JGOFS Equatorial Pacific program.                
              This hypothesis implies specific patterns and distributions of                 
              nitrogenous nutrients, their utilization and regeneration, and                 
              natural N isotope abundance in nutrients and suspended and                     
              sinking particulate material.  This project is collaborative with              
              Chris Garside (9022726) and consists of two major components:  1)              
              nutrient concentration measurements of high precision (nanomolar               
              sensitivity where necessary) and high spatial resolution; 2) low               
              level and high sensitivity tracer studies of their biological                  
              uptake and transformations. The results of this study will                     
              constitute an assessment of the relative importance of "new" and               
              "regenerated" nitrogen in the Equatorial Pacific region. The                   
              principal mechanisms regulating production will be identified,                 
              and the extent to which "new" production contributes to particle               
              flux and carbon sequestration will be assessed.
