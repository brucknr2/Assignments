Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Central to the mission of the US Joint Global Ocean Flux Study in              
              the equatorial Pacific is an understanding of the composition of               
              the planktonic food web, and the efficiency with which it                      
              transports carbon to the deep ocean. One of the specific                       
              questions being posed is whether or not iron availability is                   
              limiting productivity in this area. This project will address                  
              several dimensions of the overall equatorial Pacific plan through              
              the flow cytometric analysis of the phytoplankton component of                 
              the food web. Specifically, the project will: (1) Measure the                  
              distribution, abundance, and light scatter properties of the                   
              picoplankton, and of the larger phytoplankton, on a transect                   
              across the equator; (2) Measure the daily changes in cell number,              
              forward light scatter (size), and DNA content of individual                    
              cells, which can be translated into estimates of net and gross                 
              population growth rates; (3) Use the measured daily changes in                 
              cell number and light scatter per cell to help interpret beam                  
              attenuation measurements; (4) Test the hypothesis that iron                    
              limits phytoplankton growth in the equatorial Pacific by                       
              measuring changes in forward light scatter per cell, carbon-14                 
              incorporation per cell, and the distribution of DNA per cell of                
              specific components of the phytoplankton, in response to iron                  
              enrichment.  //
