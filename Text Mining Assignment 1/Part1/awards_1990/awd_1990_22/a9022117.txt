Abstract    :
              The central equatorial Pacific is an extensive region of high                  
              nutrient upwelling, enhanced primary productivity, and elevated                
              plankton concentrations that is of special interest to the Joint               
              Global Ocean Flux Studies (JGOFS) because it may account for 20                
              to 50% of the estimated global rate of carbon export to the deep               
              sea. The general goal of this research is to contribute to                     
              understanding the relationships among primary production, food-                
              web structure, and biogeochemical cycling and fluxes in this                   
              region as a component of the JGOFS Equatorial Pacific Program.                 
              The research utilizes a complementary set of experimental                      
              approaches (fluorescently-labelled prey particles, metabolic                   
              inhibitors, and seawater dilution) and flow cytometry techniques               
              to identify major microconsumer groups and to measure their                    
              grazing rates, behaviors, and community impacts at different                   
              temporal and spatial scales. Specifically, the research will 1)                
              determine the distributions, abundances, and biomass of pico- and              
              nanoplankton communities and their variations with depth and                   
              latitude on cross-equatorial transects, 2) identify and quantify               
              the dominant microzooplankton grazers on pico- and nanoplankton                
              communities, 3) determine the grazing impact of microzooplankton               
              on component populations of bacteria, prochlorophytes,                         
              cyanobacteria, and algae as functions of depth, time of day, and               
              trophic state, 4) evaluate the hypothesis that there is  a                     
              general size relationship linking the rates of grazing impact on               
              picoplankton  populations, and test the hypotheses that the role               
              of mixotrophy among planktonic flagellates will increase along                 
              environmental gradients from eutrophic (nutrient-rich) to                      
              oligotrophic (nutrient-poor) systems and at low light levels in                
              the euphotic zone.
