Abstract    :
                   This project will carry out research in the foundations                   
              of quantum mechanics.  The specific topics are 1) n-particle                   
              interferometry 2) possible links between violations of Bell's                  
              inequalities and the Aharonov-Bohm effect and 3) possible                      
              stochastic features of quantum dynamics.
