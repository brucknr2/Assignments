Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Light echoes from supernova SN1987A, the closest supernova in                  
              nearly four centuries, are powerful tools for studying a wide range            
              of processes in stellar evolution.  The echoes allow us to map the             
              three dimensional distribution of matter around the supernova,                 
              perform direct simple measurements of the scattering properties of             
              interstellar dust, reobserve the ultraviolet pulse that resulted               
              from the supernova shock breaching the progenitor's stellar                    
              surface, and determine the temperature and density of gas with                 
              direct measurement of recombination times.                                     
                                                                                             
              With these tools Dr. Crotts will map the three dimensional                     
              structure of the interstellar medium in a large volume of the Large            
              Magellanic Cloud, and correlate this structure with the large scale            
              motion of gas and sites of active star formation.  He will also                
              investigate the past mass loss from the supernova progenitor                   
              itself, and describe in detail the evolution of the star's mass                
              loss behavior prior to the explosion.  He will study the process               
              of the supernova shock accelerating the progenitor's surface, both             
              by observing the echoed flux from the event, and by mapping in                 
              detail the surrounding material that will interact with the highest            
              velocity ejecta on the order of a decade from now, so that the                 
              pattern of ejection from the stellar surface can then be inferred.
