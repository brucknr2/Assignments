Abstract    :
              The proposed research is designed to enhance the efficiency of                 
              and competiviness of manufacvturing firms by broadening the                    
              scope of the production scheduling function to include not                     
              only the sequence of work, but also the coordination of all                    
              resource inputs (e.g., different types of skilled labor and                    
              support equipment) required to process work.  Recognizing that                 
              certain resource types are inherently flexible (i.e., they                     
              can migrate to processors as needed) and that job operaton                     
              times often depend directly on the amount and mix of resources                 
              dedicated to tasks, the investigators formulate the flexible-                  
              resource scheduling problem with the objective of simultaneously               
              determining the job sequence and resource allocaton policy that                
              optimize a chosen measure of system performance.  General                      
              Dynamics will be their collaborator.
