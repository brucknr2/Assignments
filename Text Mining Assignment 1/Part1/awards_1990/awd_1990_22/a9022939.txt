Abstract    :
              The relationship between aggregate consumption, productivity of                
              capital, and levels of stock and bond market prices is a                       
              fundamental issue in macroeconomics and finance.  From  a                      
              macroeconomic policy perspective, an adequate understanding of the             
              interactions between real market activities and financial market               
              changes is necessary for formulating policies with direct impact               
              on the financial markets.  In addition, a reasonable theory of the             
              relationship between savings/consumption and changes in levels of              
              prices of financial assets can help policy makers interpret the                
              signals that the financial markets continuously send about the                 
              future course of economic activities.  The contribution of this                
              project comes in developing a new theory for the study of financial            
              asset prices that provides a more realistic representation of                  
              intertemporal consumption preferences than the classical additive              
              utility model.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              This project studies the microeconomic implications of a model of              
              choice under uncertainty in continuous time.  The agents in this               
              model treat consumption at nearby dates as almost perfect                      
              substitutes except possibly at information surprises.  All the                 
              time-additive as well as almost all the non-time additive utility              
              functions used in the literature fail to satisfy this local                    
              substitution property.  The project also investigates models of                
              habit formation while retaining the local substitutability of                  
              consumption.
