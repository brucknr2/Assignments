Abstract    :
                   Images of the aurora have a long historical and scientific                
              importance.  The first imaging of the aurora was done by hand.                 
              At the beginning of this century, photography, then a new                      
              technology was successfully used for the first time to study the               
              aurora.  Durign the IGY, S. Chapman and others constructed and                 
              operated all-sky cameras.  Based upon these cameras, Feldstein                 
              found that the aurora is distributed along a belt called the                   
              auroral oval.  This grant is to establish a new morphology based               
              upon the new generation of imagers aboard satellites (e.g. DE,                 
              DMSP, and Viking).  A preliminary study of DE and Viking images                
              indicates that the study of these high quality data requires a                 
              very systematic approach.  During the course of this study, it is              
              planned to train a new generation of researchers who will focus                
              on auroral morphology.
