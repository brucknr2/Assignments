Abstract    :
              The work combines studies of a recently reported, high activity                
              catalyst with experiments designed to induce the olefin                        
              polymerization step to occur at a measurable rate under vacuum                 
              conditions.    The latter approach will overcome the normal                    
              enthalpic and entropic barriers that normally constrain                        
              polymerization processes to high pressures by performing two                   
              types of experiment.  In the first experiment supersonic                       
              molecular beams of energetic monomers will be used to surmount                 
              energetic barriers.  In the second experiment the monomer will                 
              be tethered to the surface to create a high local concentration                
              of reactants at the active site so that the reaction may                       
              efficiently proceed.  The studies will use a quartz crystal                    
              microbalance to measure polymerization kinetics in situ, and a                 
              combination of Auger electron spectroscopy, high resolution                    
              electron energy loss spectroscopy and mass spectrometery to                    
              investigate the surface processes.                                             
                                                                                             
              %%%                                                                            
                                                                                             
              The research, in the general area of Analytical and Surface                    
              Chemistry, focuses on a study of various new approaches for                    
              examining the mechanism of surface-catalyzed olefin                            
              polymerization using a variety of surface science techniques to                
              investigate the surface processes.  The work promises to                       
              provide new understanding of an important industrial catalytic                 
              process,and have significance in the area of polymer thin films                
              for microelectronic packaging applications.
