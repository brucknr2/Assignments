Abstract    :
              This award provides partial support for a workshop in which                    
              university, industry, and Federal government researchers will                  
              identify and assess the research needs for automated mobile                    
              robotic platforms with material handling capabilities.  DARPA is               
              sharing in the funding of the workshop, which is expected to                   
              produce recommendations for a common set of specifications and                 
              features for such mobile platforms suitable for a variety of                   
              research in vehicle navigation, noncontact sensors such as                     
              vision systems, contact position and force sensing, processing of              
              sensory information for guiding mobility and manipulation of                   
              multiple manipulators and multiple sensors, and multi-modal                    
              systems integration.
