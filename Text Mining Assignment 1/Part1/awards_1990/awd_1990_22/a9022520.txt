Abstract    :
                   An experiment to study threshold pion production in                       
              proton-proton collisions will be conducted at the IUCF Cooler.                 
              The equipment required for this experiment (including a new                    
              ring magnet and a new two-arm detector system) has been built                  
              and tested at the University of Pittsburgh and IUCF.  The new                  
              magnet will become a permanent part of the Cooler ring.  The                   
              experiment measuring differential cross sections and analyzing                 
              powers will run during 1991.  A followup experiment measuring                  
              the complete scattering matrix using a polarized beam and                      
              target is proposed here.                                                       
                   Development work for an approved CEBAF experiment in eta                  
              electroproduction from the proton will be carried out.  The                    
              Pittsburgh effort is in building the drift chamber array that                  
              surrounds the target within the CEBAF Large Acceptance                         
              Spectrometer, an effort requiring significant planning                         
              and testing.
