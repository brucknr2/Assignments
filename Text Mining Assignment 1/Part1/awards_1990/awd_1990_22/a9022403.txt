Abstract    :
              Oceanic primary production plays an important role in buffering                
              atmospheric CO2. A significant portion of global primary                       
              production takes places in the surface water of the Equatorial                 
              Pacific. This project will be a component of the JGOFS Equatorial              
              Pacific Experiment. Nutrient levels, distribution of particulate               
              nitrogen and rates of 15N-nitrogen assimilation will be measured               
              to determine: 1) How much "new production" occurs in the central               
              Equatorial Pacific?. 2) What controls the level of new                         
              production?. 3) Does some new production accumulate as                         
              particulate nitrogen?, and 4) Is some new production converted                 
              to dissolved organic nitrogen?.//
