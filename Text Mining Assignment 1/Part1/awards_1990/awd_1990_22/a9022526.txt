Abstract    :
              This award is for the purchase of equipment for the high speed                 
              acquisition of images and for manipulator end-effector hardware.               
              The image equipment is needed for real-time performance and the                
              end-effector hardware is needed for experimentation with                       
              manipulation tasks.  The equipment is also used in integrating                 
              vision and manipulation tasks incorporating perception, cognition,             
              and action.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              Applied robotics involves the integration of many areas including              
              vision research, control research, sensor integration, and planning            
              algorithms.  This proposal requests funds for the purchase of                  
              equipment to support vision research and manipulator research.  The            
              vision equipment will allow real time processing of visual data                
              while the manipulators (grippers, etc.) will allow the testing of              
              manipulator algorithms with the robot arm connected to actual                  
              manipulators.
