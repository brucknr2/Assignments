Abstract    :
              The objective of this research is to develop a damage model                    
              to model the crack growth that occurs in hollow cylinder                       
              tests of Indiana limestone, as well as in other complicated                    
              boundary value problems. The damage model will be developed                    
              by implementing a micromechanical model into an elastic                        
              finite element code. The outcome could eventually eliminate                    
              the need for empirical constitutive relations in brittle                       
              rocks for which micromechanical models have been developed.
