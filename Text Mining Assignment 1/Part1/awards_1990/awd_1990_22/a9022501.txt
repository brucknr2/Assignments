Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This program is a continuation of the pioneering work of the group             
              headed by Dr. B.F. Burke, concentrating on the study of                        
              gravitational lenses.  Extension of their large survey to the                  
              Southern hemisphere is under way, and the discovery of more of                 
              these interesting objects is anticipated.                                      
                                                                                             
              Once identified, these systems will be utilized to obtain an                   
              independent evaluation of the Hubble constant, using the                       
              gravitational time delay effect.  Those of the newly discovered                
              Einstein ring type will also allow definitive determinations of                
              galactic masses.  In addition, the group will use the survey                   
              material to search for high-redshift radio galaxies and quasars,               
              and to study their radio properties.
