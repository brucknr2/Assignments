Abstract    :
              This grant, funded under the Small Grants for Exploratory                      
              Research Program, will study several elections markets in Germany              
              for the parliamentary elections for a unified Germany, scheduled               
              to take place on December 2, 1990. Markets will be designed to                 
              predict the outcome of the all-German election.                                
                                                                                             
              The research will yield important insights into the operation of               
              both markets and elections. From the standpoint of markets, it                 
              will be determined how successfully markets can forecast an                    
              unprecedented event and, in the case of East Germany, how                      
              successfully markets operate in a culture conditioned on a                     
              nonmarket economy. From the standpoint of elections, the impact                
              of various campaign practices and events on the election outcome               
              will be investigated. The cultural and institutional differences               
              among East Germany, West Germany and the United Sates present                  
              unusual opportunities for comparative analysis of markets and                  
              election campaigns.
