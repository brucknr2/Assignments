Abstract    :
              With support from the Organic Dynamics Program, Dr. Regen will                 
              study the characterization of amphiphilic ion pairs, i.e.,                     
              novel vesicle-forming materials derived from single-chain                      
              cations and single-chain anions, via careful examination of                    
              molecular structure-supramolecular structure/property                          
              relationships. His study focuses upon examination of the                       
              following structural variables: (i) alkyl chain length, (ii)                   
              chain length mismatch, (iii) head group size, and (iv) double-                 
              vs. triple-chain ion-paired amphiphiles (IPAs).                                
              %%%                                                                            
              The primary objective of Dr. Regen's research program is to                    
              prepare new and improved models for biological membranes.                      
              Ion-paired amphiphiles (IPAs) are of interest in this                          
              connection due to their ability to function as vesicle-forming                 
              surfactants. Dr. Regen's study seeks to define experimentally                  
              those structural features of single-chain surfactants which are                
              important in controlling vesicle formation, monolayer packing,                 
              and bilayer permeability. As an offshoot of this study, Dr.                    
              Regen plans to explore the feasibility of using IPA-based                      
              membranes as chemical sensors and as actuators. Thus, several                  
              of the IPAs to be synthesized may find application as a new                    
              class of chemical devices.
