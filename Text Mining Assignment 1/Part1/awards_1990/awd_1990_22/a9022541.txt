Abstract    :
              Two signal generators and a signal analyzer will be used in order              
              to study wideband digital signal and information processing                    
              devices. The devices will be used in a computer controlled network             
              testbed in order to replicate theoretical results indicating a                 
              possible 4 order of magnitude improvement in the ability to detect             
              signals in the wideband signalling environment.                                
              %%%                                                                            
              New hardware devices capable of transmitting data at high rates                
              require conversions from analog signals to digital signals. Recent             
              theoretical work by the PIs indicate that substantial improvements             
              in signal detection in these environments is possible. The signal              
              generators and analyzers are needed to experimentally validate the             
              theoretical studies.
