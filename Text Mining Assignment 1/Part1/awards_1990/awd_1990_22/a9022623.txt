Abstract    :
              Technical Narrative: The research project "Ultrafast Processes                 
              and Optoelectronic Properties of Semiconductor Microstructures"                
              will be a collaboration between Dr. Arora of the Tata Institute                
              of Fundamental Research, Bombay, India and Dr. Jagdeep                         
              Shah at the AT&T Bell Laboratories, Holmdel, N.J.  The specific                
              aims of this proposal are: (1) to facilitate cooperation between               
              TIFR scientists and Dr. Shah and his group at the AT&T Bell                    
              Laboratories in setting up material and device structure                       
              preparation systems and time resolved measurement laboratory                   
              required for the study of the ultrafast phenomena in novel                     
              semiconductor heterostructure and superlattice systems, and (2)                
              to collaborate in the research programs related to the                         
              optoelectronic properties of the above materials.                              
                                                                                             
              Scope: This proposal is for funds to cover the travel and the per              
              diem expenses of the Principal Investigator and other U.S.                     
              scientists participating in this collaboration.  The                           
              investigation is of great importance form the basic science point              
              of view as the studies will provide fundamental understanding of               
              nonequilibrium carrier dynamics and new optoelectronic phenomena               
              in the above structures.  Furthermore, the study is of great                   
              practical relevance in understanding the operation of novel                    
              devices which have been made from very special thin film                       
              heterostructures.  This proposal meets the objectives of the U.S.              
              -India Cooperative Science Program.  ***
