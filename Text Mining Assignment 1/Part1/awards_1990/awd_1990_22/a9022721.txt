Abstract    :
              With support from the Organic Dynamics Program, Dr. Doyle will                 
              design new chiral rhodium catalysts that will be used to                       
              generate carbenoids from diazocompounds. Intramolecular                        
              cyclization reactions of these carbenoids that lead, e.g., to                  
              the formation of lactones and lactams are expected to display                  
              exceptionally high enantioselectivities. It is likely that                     
              significant new, synthetically useful methods for asymmetric                   
              synthesis will result from this work.                                          
                                                                                             
              The reactions to be studied include chiral intra- and inter-                   
              molecular cyclopropanations, cycloadditions to aromatic                        
              systems, and carbon-hydrogen insertion processes that result in                
              the formation of lactones and lactams. These studies will                      
              consist of a combination of: (i) catalyst preparation and                      
              characterization, (ii) mechanistic investigations, and (iii)                   
              synthetic applications.
