Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The central equatorial Pacific is a very large region with high                
              primary production, which is hypothesized to support a                         
              substantial faction of global new production.  New production                  
              is important because of its link to the vertical flux of                       
              meterial from the upper to the lower ocean and the implied role                
              of that link in how the ocean cycles radiatively-active gases                  
              (the greenhouse problem).                                                      
                                                                                             
              This project constitues a part of the US joint global ocean                    
              flux study (JGOFS) in the central equatorial pacific and seeks                 
              to answer some baic questions about the role of heterotrophic                  
              bacteria in the equatorial Pacific.  Heterotrophic bacteria are                
              believed to be an important component of the equatorial pacific                
              system as: 1. they are one of the predominant sinks of                         
              dissolved organic nitrogen and carbon; 2. they are nitrogen                    
              rich with a carbon to nitrogen ratio of about 4.5; 3. they                     
              comprise a large portion of the biomass, and may at times be                   
              greater than the phytoplankton; and 4. they account for a large                
              fraction of ammonium uptake in a number of marine systems.                     
              This project will examine the role of heterotrophic bacteria in                
              nitrogen cycling in the equatorial pacific and will                            
              specifically measure bacterial production, biomass, and                        
              nitrogen uptake by bacteria.
