Abstract    :
              This project will continue studying the geologic history of                    
              West Antarctica and the relationship of West to East                           
              Antarctica by collecting paleomagnetic samples from Mesozoic                   
              age Antarctic Peninsula rocks.  Resolving the position of                      
              the different West Antarctic crustal blocks is critical in                     
              understanding the opening history of the Weddell Sea and the                   
              resulting paleo-climatic, paleo-oceanographic and paleo-                       
              biologic implications of the Weddell Sea opening.  It is                       
              hoped that by systematically collecting paleomagnetic                          
              samples ranging in age from the Triassic through late                          
              Cretaceous that a more complete apparent polar wander path                     
              can be constructed for the Antarctic Peninsula.  Such a                        
              polar wander path can help constrain the position of the                       
              Antarctic Peninsula with respect to East Antarctica and                        
              provide information on the time of opening of the Weddell                      
              Sea.                                                                           
                                                                                             
              The field program depends in the close support from the R/V                    
              Polar Duke to collect paleomagnetic samples from                               
              sedimentary, volcanic and intrusive rock from the Antarctic.                   
              Supplemental funds will allow the purchase equipment for the                   
              field analysis of paleomagnetic data.
