Abstract    :
              Several lines of evidence including vibrating calcium specific                 
              electrode measurements and calcium-imaging data support the                    
              hypothesis that calcium gradients are involved in setting up cell              
              polarity.  Of particular interest is the relationship between                  
              calcium gradients in sea urchin eggs which develop during                      
              pronuclear migration/fusion and the subsequent axis of cleavage.               
              We also propose to study the role of calcium gradients in                      
              orienting motile cells such as macrophages and T lymphocytes.  We              
              propose to test this hypothesis directly, through the development              
              of new optical tools including new long-wavelength, ratioable                  
              calcium indicators, probes for following the movements of the                  
              centrosome and methods for making localized gradients of calcium               
              ions in cells.  Included in the proposal is a proposed solution                
              to the well recognized problems of dye loading and                             
              compartmentation seen with fura-2 and other ion indicators.
