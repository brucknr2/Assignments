Abstract    :
              This research is concerned with fundamental problems involving the             
              growth and characterization of thin heteroepitaxial germanium films            
              on crystalline silicon substrates with a (100) orientation which               
              exhibits a 2 x 1 surface reconstruction.  Recent theoretical and               
              experimental studies have given support for dramatic changes in the            
              electronic band structure of germanium/silicon systems resulting               
              from changing the strain and superlattice composition on an atomic             
              scale.  This group has found evidence for pseudomorphic domains in             
              germanium films on silicon grown at room temperature.  It is now               
              proposed to investigate the structure of thin germanium films on               
              silicon grown at low temperatures and also as a function of                    
              temperature.  This work involves a unique combination of analytic              
              techniques:  transmission ion channeling, scanning tunneling                   
              microscopy, low energy electron diffraction, and Auger electron                
              spectroscopy.  A second emphasis will involve the surface chemistry            
              of adatoms on strained germanium.  It is hoped one can distinguish             
              the seperate roles played by chemistry, geometry, and strain in                
              determining the bonding site of the adatom.  Initially tin and                 
              sulfur will be employed as adatoms.
