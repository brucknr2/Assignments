Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              Diagenesis on the seafloor and in the upper portion of the                     
              sediment column regulates the relative fractions of the                        
              particulate rain to the seafloor that are buried in sediments or               
              remineralized and recycled into the overlying water column.  The               
              relative magnitute of the recycled flux can be assessed by                     
              direct measurement of benthic exchange using in situ incubation                
              chambers, complemented by studies of pore water and solid phase                
              chemistry.  As part of the JGOFS program direct flux                           
              measurements of radon, nutrients, calcium, alkalinity, and                     
              oxygen will be carried out under this project.  In addition,                   
              incubation chamber samples will be collected for studies of the                
              trace metal and DOM fluxes by other investigators.  Results from               
              these studies will serve to relate diagenesis on the seafloor and              
              in the sediments to JGOFS measurements of productivity and                     
              particle rain rate.  They will assist in interpreting the                      
              paleoceanographic record preserved in sediments and in                         
              understanding the importance of processes at the seafloor in the               
              global biogeochemical fluxes of carbon and nutrients.
