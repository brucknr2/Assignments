Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports a combination of new observations, theoretical             
              analysis, and numerical modeling to develop fully self-consistent              
              models of the dynamics and structure of barred spiral galaxies.                
              The investigators are world leaders in this field, and this study              
              will greatly deepen our understanding of the fundamental mechanisms            
              that determine the structure and evolution of these objects.
