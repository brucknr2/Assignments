Abstract    :
              The equipment acquired by this award will be used in the User                  
              Studies Laboratory at Carnegie Mellon University for Human-Computer            
              Interaction (HCI) studies.  The equipment consists of video                    
              equipment for recording actions of users, editing equipment for                
              annotating these actions, and a computer with large disk store for             
              storing video images and for processing data.  The research                    
              projects using the equipment include testing models of HCI, studies            
              of spoken and multi-modal computer interfaces, and computer                    
              tutoring.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              The use of computers is ubiquitous both in the workplace and in                
              schools.  An important aspect of the use of computers is the                   
              human/computer interface; the means by which computers and humans              
              exchange information.  The design of good interfaces is more of an             
              art form than a science.  The researchers at the User Studies                  
              Laboratory at Carnegie Mellon University will use this                         
              Instrumentation award to purchase equipment essential to their                 
              research.  This equipment will enable them to study, in great                  
              detail, how users interact with computers.  It will enable them to             
              test theories of what makes a good interface and will also enable              
              them to study students using the computer for learning purposes.
