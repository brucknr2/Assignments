Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              The equatorial Pacific represents a significant portion of the                 
              ocean/atmosphere CO2 system and is the largest regional source                 
              for CO2 to the atmosphere.  The sensitivity of the processes                   
              controlling pCO2 to climatic forcing is attested to by the                     
              impact of the ENSO cycles on the sea surface pCO2, and by the                  
              apparent change in equatorial production during the last                       
              glacial period.  A central goal of JGOFS Equatorial Pacific                    
              Process Study is to elucidate the links between the physical                   
              circulation and the biological and chemical processes that                     
              control the surface ocean pCO2.  A crucial part of this program                
              must be to measure the pCO2 in conjunction with the other                      
              chemical and biological measurements.  pCO2, total CO2, and                    
              alkalinity of the upper ocean will be measured using proven and                
              standard methods, on the two "survey" upper ocean JGOFS                        
              cruises.  Measurement of pCO2 directly, as opposed to                          
              calculating pCO2 from other measurements, is necessary to                      
              accurately calculate air-sea fluxes.  The variation of total                   
              CO2 and alkalinity will constrain the dynamics of organic                      
              carbon and calcite, respectively.  The carbonate chemistry data                
              will be incorporated into a detailed physical circulation model                
              of the equatorial Pacific, to address questions of thermocline                 
              ventilation and the effect of nutrient utilization efficiency                  
              on atmospheric pCO2.
