Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Protein kinase C (PKC) is an enzyme involved in mediating and                  
              regulating the actions of many neurotransmitters, hormones and                 
              growth factors.  Ubiquitously located in the body and mainly                   
              concentrated in the brain, protein kinase C is activated by                    
              second messengers, Ca2+ and diacylglycerol.  The activity of                   
              protein kinase C has been implicated in a number of neurological               
              functions such as neurite extension, regulation of ionic                       
              conductances and neurotransmitter release.  PKC exerts its                     
              effects on neuronal activity by attaching phosphate groups to                  
              substrate proteins.  The goal of this research project is to                   
              examine the mechanisms by which the enzyme regulates cell                      
              activity at the molecular level.  Three in vivo substrates will                
              be characterized and identified by studying the pathway of PKC                 
              activation.  Dr. Scholz will utilize glutamate receptors to                    
              stimulate PKC phosphorylation.  Results from this study will                   
              provide additional information on the function of PKC in neuronal              
              development.
