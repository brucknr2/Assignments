Abstract    :
              This grant provides funds for the analysis of the data obtained                
              from a sodium lidar the was operated at South Pole throughout 1990             
              and also to begin the development of improved lidar systems for a              
              new South Pole lidar facility.  The earlier instrument made                    
              measurements of polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs), which play an               
              important role in the development of the annual stratospheric ozone            
              hole, and also measured the motions of the sodium layer near the               
              mesopause (approximately 90 km altitude) to elucidate the dynamics             
              of the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MALT) region.  It is                 
              expected that the proposed new lidar facility will be built in                 
              conjunction with colleagues from the University of Rome with the               
              support of the Italian Antarctic Program.  The improved lidar                  
              systems will be able to measure high altitude temperatures and also            
              determine the characteristics of stratospheric aerosols as well as             
              detect PSCs and the sodium layer.                                              
                                                                                             
              These studies are important for the understanding of stratospheric             
              chemistry and the causes of polar ozone depletion and for                      
              understanding the dynamics of the MALT region.  There will be a                
              significant contribution to the Coupling of Energetics and Dynamics            
              through Atmospheric Regions (CEDAR) initiative.                                
                                                                                             
              This project is jointly supported by NSF's Divisions of Polar                  
              Programs and Atmospheric Sciences.
