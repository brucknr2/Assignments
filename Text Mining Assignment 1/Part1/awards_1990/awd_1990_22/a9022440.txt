Abstract    :
              This is a Phase II SBIR research activity. Its                                 
              goal is to define the processing requirements                                  
              for combining shape-memory film technology                                     
              with silicon micro-fabrication.  This will be                                  
              done by focusing on development of a                                           
              microvalve.  Questions raised in Phase I will                                  
              be addressed, structures will be fabricated on                                 
              silicon and film actuators tested, a valve                                     
              design test bed will be constructed and a                                      
              variety of valve configurations examined, and                                  
              silicon based microvalves will be fabricated                                   
              over a range of sizes.
