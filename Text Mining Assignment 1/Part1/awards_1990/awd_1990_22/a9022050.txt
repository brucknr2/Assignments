Abstract    :
              Research activities in Antarctica of the Division of Polar                     
              Programs of the National Science Foundation (NSF) are provided                 
              logistics support from NSF facilities in Christchurch, New                     
              Zealand.  Components of this logistics support are the U.S. Naval              
              Support Force, Antarctica and its subordinate commands, an NSF                 
              civilian U.S. contractor, and smaller contractors and vendors in               
              New Zealand.  In order to ensure that all required resources are               
              in place and operational when needed, NSF is seeking a study to                
              review and analyze the current support arrangements and costs and              
              to determine the optimal mix of resources and the probable costs               
              of that mix.  In addition, the study will recommend feasible                   
              trade-offs between various means or sources of logistics support.              
                                                                                             
              This action provides the first incremental funding for this study.
