Abstract    :
                   Symbolic dynamics and related areas are currently undergoing              
              dramatic developments.  The recent introduction of deep and                    
              powerful machinery has solved some of the hardest and most                     
              tantalizing open problems.  In addition, symbolic dynamics is                  
              having a substantial impact in other areas, such as in                         
              characterizing the non-zero spectrum of non-negative real matrices,            
              or in constructing codes for data storage and transmission.                    
                   This grant will partially support a conference on symbolic                
              dynamics and its applications to be held at Yale University in                 
              July, 1991.  The topics to be emphasized include symbolic dynamical            
              systems, applications to geometric dynamics, information theory,               
              and linear algebra as well as connections with ergodic theory.  A              
              significant portion of young researchers will be among the invited             
              speakers, and the conference should advance this active and                    
              important area of current research in a meaningful way.
