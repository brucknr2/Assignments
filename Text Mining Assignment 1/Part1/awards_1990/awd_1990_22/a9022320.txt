Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The research will provide basic information for the preparation                
              of a fiber optic probe for lithium ion based on new fluorescent                
              lithium ion carriers immobilized on fiber optic bundles by                     
              Langmuir-Blodgett (L-B) film techniques.   This is a Small                     
              Business Innovation Research (SBIR) award.                                     
                                                                                             
              In Phase I four new florescent ionophores were synthesized.  One               
              of these has greater sensitivity and great Li/Na selectivity than              
              any other fluorescent ionophore reported in the literature and is              
              suitable for preparation of L-B films.                                         
                                                                                             
              In the current Phase II additional analogs of these ionophores                 
              which will have absorption and emission in the visible spectrum                
              will be evaluated.  Those having the best optical characteristics              
              and specificity for lithium, when prepared as L-B films, will be               
              used to prepare fiber optic probes.  These will be evaluated as                
              sensors for determination of lithium in blood serum.
