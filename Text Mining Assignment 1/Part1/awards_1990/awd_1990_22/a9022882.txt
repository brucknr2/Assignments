Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              This award supports research on the role that congressional                    
              committees play in determining the outcome of legislation on the               
              floor of Congress.  Legislative scholars have long been aware that             
              the decisions made by congressional committees are rarely                      
              overturned on the floor of the Congress.  However, some committees             
              are accorded much greater deference than others.  A number of                  
              explanations have been advanced to explain this pattern, though                
              most of these are somewhat speculative and ad hoc.                             
                                                                                             
              This innovative research attempts to build upon existing                       
              explanations of committee floor success by developing a formal                 
              theory based on the assumption that legislators are rational actors            
              concerned with maximizing individual interest but guided by a                  
              central agent, in this case by party leaders. The theory will be               
              tested using detailed legislative histories of all bills reported              
              by standing committees in the 84th, 86th, 88th, 90th, 92nd, 94th               
              96th 98th and 100th Congresses.                                                
                                                                                             
              When completed this project will help us better understand the                 
              dynamics of the legislative process that influence individuals to              
              cooperate for collective benefits.  Such an understanding of how               
              collective goods are produced in the highly decentralized                      
              environment which is Congress is essential for developing better               
              legislative strategies to cope with other collective goods problems            
              such as deficit reduction and campaign finance reform.
