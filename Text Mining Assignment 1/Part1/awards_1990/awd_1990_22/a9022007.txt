Abstract    :
              Genetic algorithms (GAs) -- search                                             
              algorithms based on the mechanics                                              
              of natural genetics and natural

              increasingly important roles in                                                
              complex systems optimization and                                               
              machine learning, but further                                                  
              progress depends on the creation of                                            
              new quantitative and qualitative                                               
              theory that more adequately                                                    
              explains GA power.  This project                                               
              extends and expands the analytical                                             
              and metaphorical theory available                                              
              for genetic algorithm design and                                               
              analysis.  Important topic areas of                                            
              analytical theory are investigated,                                            
              including classification methods,                                              
              deterministic population models,                                               
              nonconventional population models,                                             
              and Walsh methods.  ANalogies to                                               
              biological, social, and economic                                               
              systems are also drawn and used as                                             
              a source of new GA  mechanism.  In                                             
              particular, natural recombination                                              
              and gene expression are used as a                                              
              source of design inspiration.                                                  
              Together, the study provides the                                               
              foundations for understanding the                                              
              operation of the current generation                                            
              of genetic algorithms and for                                                  
              designing the next.
