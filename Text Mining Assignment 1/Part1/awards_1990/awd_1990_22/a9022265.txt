Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Analyses of rates of change in fossil-pollen data from                    
              eastern North America reveal that many sites experienced major                 
              changes 10,000-13,000 years ago during the last deglaciation and               
              again during the last 1000 years.  The PIs propose to expand                   
              previous research to several new regions of the northern                       
              hemisphere, and to determine the timing, magnitude, and                        
              geographic patterns of changes in climate and vegetation during                
              the past 18,000 years in northwestern as well as eastern North                 
              America.  They will also use a parallel database in Europe to                  
              study the patterns and rates of change in Europe over the last                 
              18,000 years, for comparison with North America.  Through use of               
              pollen databases for North America and Europe, this research will              
              establish the degree to which rapid vegetation changes in a broad              
              band around the northern hemisphere are synchronous, and will                  
              thus identify probable times of major rapid changes in                         
              atmospheric circulation.                                                       
                   In addition, special attention will be given to a critical                
              site, Lake Tulane, Florida which has a continuous high-resolution              
              pollen stratigraphy extending to at least 45,000 years ago.  The               
              pollen stratigraphy from Lake Tulane exhibits major, abrupt                    
              changes, which may correlate with as yet poorly understood                     
              isotope fluctuations in the Dye 3 Greenland ice core during the                
              period 25,000-55,000 years ago.  The results of the research will              
              provide very important data on the nature and extent of global                 
              change in the last 20,000 years.
