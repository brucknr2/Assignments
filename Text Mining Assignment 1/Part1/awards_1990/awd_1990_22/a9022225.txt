Abstract    :
              The overall objective of this research project is to                           
              develop improved amperometric biosensors based on new                          
              polymeric electron relay systems, which can electrically                       
              couple flavoenzyme molecules to a conventional electrode                       
              surface.  By using the proposed method of facilitating                         
              electron transfer from the enzyme to the electrode, along                      
              with novel enzyme immobilization techniques, the Principal                     
              Investigators (PIs) suggest that it will be possible to                        
              make amperometric biosensors for a large number of                             
              clinically and industrially important molecules.  These                        
              sensors should be highly stable in both continuous                             
              operation and multiple-use applications.
