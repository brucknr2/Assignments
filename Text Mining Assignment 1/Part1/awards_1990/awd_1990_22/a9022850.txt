Abstract    :
                   An extensive data base of on-site and ground based data is                
              used to describe various features of the electrodynamics and                   
              plasma composition in the ionosphere.  This proposal describes an              
              effort to interpret observational phenomenon with the aid of                   
              simple and sophisticated computer models containing some of the                
              basic physics of a particular phenomenon.  Comparison of the                   
              predicted and observed behavior is used as an indicator of the                 
              adequacy of the physical description and as a confirmation of our              
              understanding of the phenomenon.  The following features will be               
              studied with this approach:                                                    
                   The scale-size dependency of electric field mapping and its               
              effects on the expected relationship between field and currents                
              and particle precipitation.                                                    
                   The effects of winds and waves in the bottomside F-region on              
              the generation of large scale dynamo fields and smaller scale                  
              intermediate plasma layers.                                                    
                   The response of the ionosphere to large sub-auroral ion                   
              drifts with varying evolution times.  ***
