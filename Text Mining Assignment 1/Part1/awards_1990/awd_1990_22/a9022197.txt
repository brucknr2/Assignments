Abstract    :
                   The transport of energetic particles in the Earth's                       
              atmosphere and inner magnetosphere is investigated theoretically               
              and some resulting auroral spectroscopic emissions are observed                
              experimentally.  Specifically, a generalized transport equation                
              is adapted for application to electron transport, without and                  
              with an acceleration term, to proton/hydrogen atom beam, and to                
              hot atoms produced by auroral collisional interactions.  Global                
              spectral images are analyzed to yield geophysical parameters for               
              TIEGCM (thermosphere ionosphere electrodynamic general                         
              circulation model) investigations and the resulting global                     
              history is used in a detailed 1-D auroral model.  Suites of                    
              auroral spectral emissions features are used to investigate                    
              particle fluxes: species, flux magnitude and characteristic                    
              energy, as well as changes in atmospheric composition.
