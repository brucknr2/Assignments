Abstract    :
              In this SBIR project, Vatell Corporation is designing,                         
              constructing and testing a prototype instrument for                            
              simultaneously measuring thermal conductivity and diffusivity.                 
              The instrument incorporates a Heat Flux Microsensor probe to                   
              measure heat flow and thermocouples to measure surface                         
              temperatures.  It is microprocessor-based, performing all                      
              calculations needed to resolve transient signals of the probe                  
              and thermocouples into values of thermal conductivity and                      
              diffusivity.  To measure these thermal properties for a                        
              material, a small sample (approximately 2" square and 1/2"                     
              thick) of the material is placed in the test chamber of the                    
              instrument.  The operator selects an initial temperature for                   
              the measuring probe.  This selection establishes the range of                  
              temperatures over which the sample's thermal properties will                   
              be determined.  The probe is preheated to this temperature and                 
              then automatically makes contact with the surface of the                       
              sample.  The signal of the microsensor, representing transient                 
              heat flow into the sample, and the thermocouple signals                        
              representing the decreasing temperature at the probe face and                  
              the sample's surface temperature rise, is digitized and                        
              recorded by the instrument.  The microprocessor then                           
              calculates and displays the thermal conductivity and                           
              diffusivity of the sample.
