Abstract    :
              In research supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry                  
              Program in the Chemistry Division, Professor Lubman and his                    
              students will study the fragmentation of ions subjected to                     
              laser photoexcitation.  By adjusting the wavelength of the                     
              light, varying amounts of energy will be imparted to the                       
              molecules, thus allowing selected sets of bonds to break.  The                 
              long term goal is to develop methods which will allow                          
              differential detection of similar biomolecules.                                
                                                                                             
              %%%                                                                            
                                                                                             
              In research supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry                  
              Program in the Chemistry Division, Lubman's group will                         
              investigate the competitive kinetics of gas phase ion                          
              fragmentation permitted by near-threshold photoexcitation.  In                 
              a collisionless environment, internal redistribution of                        
              absorbed energy allows selected subsets of bonds to break.                     
              While one cannot target breaking of specific bonds, it is hoped                
              that characteristic sets of bonds can be kinetically preferred                 
              for particular excitation conditions.
