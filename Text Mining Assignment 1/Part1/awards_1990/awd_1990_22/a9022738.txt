Abstract    :
              Integrated studies of issues in managing research and human                    
              responses to global climate change will be done.  While the                    
              elements of the work interact, for expository and administrative               
              convenience, the project is divided into two broad activities:  An             
              integrated assessment, focusing particularly on uncertainty, and               
              studies of public understanding and communication.  While global               
              climate change issues are important in their own right, they are               
              prototypical of a class of issues in science, technology, and                  
              public policy in which:  1) there are a significant number of                  
              different elements whose interactions cannot safely be ignored in              
              planning research, performing policy analysis, or formulating                  
              policy responses; 2) uncertainty involving these elements and their            
              interactions is large and unlikely to be fully resolved before                 
              potential impacts would be felt and policy choices will have to be             
              made; and 3) public understanding of these scientific and technical            
              issues is of central importance and improved risk communication is             
              essential to better public policy.
