Abstract    :
              This is an award to support research on the rate at which                      
              non-aqueous phase liquids that reach a groundwater aquifer                     
              undergo interactions with the groundwater and constituents                     
              of the aquifer itself.  The project addresses the                              
              dissolution of liquids such as benzene, carbon                                 
              tetrachloride and vinyl chloride when they form pools on                       
              the surface or below the surface of the groundwater.  The                      
              investigator plans on using an aquifer simulation                              
              laboratory model to simulate an aquifer and data will be                       
              used to determine the mass transfer coefficients and to                        
              validate the mathematical model that incorporates                              
              longitudinal advection, longitudinal and vertical                              
              dispersion, and adsorption.                                                    
                                                                                             
              The fluids being studied in this project are                                   
              characteristic of groundwater contaminants that may be                         
              subject to removal by an extraction process.  However, the                     
              extraction is influenced by the limited solubility of the                      
              target fluids in water.  Results of this project may be                        
              applied to better engineering design of systems for                            
              removal of this class of contaminants from  groundwater.
