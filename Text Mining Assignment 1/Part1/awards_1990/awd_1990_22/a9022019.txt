Abstract    :
              The subject of the workshop is two-phase flow visualization,                   
              image analysis and data interpretation, with focus on                          
              particulate flow.  Flow visualization is an essential non-                     
              intrusive method of investigation of two-phase flow structure                  
              and the underlying dynamics.  The objective is to identify                     
              emerging new methods of visualization and interpretation.  The                 
              meeting will be organized by Dr. W.J. Yang (University of                      
              Michigan) and Dr. D.D. Joseph (University of Minnesota).                       
                                                                                             
              The proposed workshop will provide a forum to evaluate the                     
              present research on particulate two-phase flow visualization,                  
              and to establish future trends in that area.  The written                      
              report will be distributed to universities and research                        
              centers involved in flow visualization.
