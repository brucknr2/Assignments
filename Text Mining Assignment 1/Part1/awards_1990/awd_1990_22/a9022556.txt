Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is an experimental research program to investigate fracture               
              processes associated with crack initiation and stable crack growth             
              and their relationships to microstructure.  Microstructure                     
              parameters are systematically varied to determine the effects of               
              primary particle spacing, primary volume fraction, and fine scale              
              microstructure independently of one another.  The role of primary              
              particle spacing on fracture initiation toughness, the influence of            
              particle spacing on ductility in shear, and the effects of                     
              toughness on stable crack growth are under study using steel as a              
              model material.  The fracture process, damage accumulation, void               
              growth, and strain distributions are analyzed.  The research                   
              provides important knowledge for the understanding and modeling of             
              fracture processes in high strength metal alloys.
