Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The Materials Research Laboratory (MRL) at Stanford                       
              University supports interactive and interdisciplinary materials                
              research in three primary thrust areas.                                        
                   Researchers in the polymers thrust are studying polymer                   
              structure and dynamics using optical techniques; emphasis is                   
              being placed on increasingly complex materials, and an expert in               
              chemical synthesis has joined the group.  The thrust program on                
              superconducting materials focuses on the preparation of                        
              high-temperature superconducting materials in a variety of ways                
              and on understanding the behavior of these materials.                          
              Researchers in the surface structure and reactivity group, in a                
              collaborative effort with IBM Almaden, are investigating the                   
              structure, mobility and reactivity of adsorbates on surfaces,                  
              using spectroscopic techniques with a strong emphasis on                       
              synchrotron radiation.                                                         
                   The Stanford MRL places a strong emphasis on the                          
              development, operation and maintenance of major central research               
              facilities in materials preparation and characterization.  It                  
              also provides seed funding for exploratory research; supports                  
              initiatives to broaden the participation of women and minorities               
              in materials research; and fosters research participation by                   
              undergraduates.  The program currently involves 26 faculty                     
              members and senior personnel from eight academic departments, 3                
              postdoctoral research associates, 50 graduate students and 13                  
              undergraduates, and supporting scientific and clerical staff.                  
              The Stanford MRL is directed by Professor Stig B. Hagstrom.
