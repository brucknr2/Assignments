Abstract    :
                   Through this award to the American Institute of Physics,                  
              partial support is provided for a conference on the recruitment                
              and retention of women in physics to be held in November 1990                  
              in the Washington, D.C. area.  The conference will focus on                    
              recruitment and retention of women at the undergraduate and                    
              graduate student levels.  One of the important goals of the                    
              conference is to identify the attributes of departments that                   
              have been successful in attracting and keeping women in physics                
              programs.  The invitees will include representatives of                        
              professional societies, physics faculty members, and female                    
              faculty from smaller institutions and women minority students                  
              will be especially encouraged.  Conference proceedings will be                 
              published and results of the conference will be discussed at                   
              the annual joint meeting of AAPT and APS in winter, 1991.
