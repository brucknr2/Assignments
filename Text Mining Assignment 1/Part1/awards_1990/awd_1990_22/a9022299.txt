Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              One important goal of the Global Ocean Flux Study in the                       
              equatorial Pacific is to characterize material fluxes from the                 
              surface ocean to the deep sea.  Marine sediments, and the fossil               
              shells they contain, can play a vital role in the ultimate                     
              achievement of this goal.  In this proposal the P.I.'s wish to                 
              conduct a four-phase study of microfossils collected 1) in                     
              stratified plankton tows, 2) in sediment traps, 3) preserved in                
              near-surface sediments of the equatorial Pacific and 4) sediments              
              which span the last full glacial-interglacial cycle.  The P.I.'s               
              propose a quantitative census of radiolaria and foraminifera, the              
              two dominant zooplankton fossil groups, and detailed stable                    
              isotopic analysis of foraminifera found in plankton tow, sediment              
              trap, and near surface sediment samples of the Equatorial                      
              Stations.  This experiment will improve our understanding of the               
              processes that contribute to the formation of marine sediments.                
              With this understanding, we will be better able to reconstruct                 
              these processes from the preserved sediment record, to assess                  
              past variations in biogenic fluxes.
