Abstract    :
              The goal of this proposed research is to develop a                             
              large-scale process to produce functional mammalian                            
              antibody proteins by employing modified plant cells.  The                      
              creation of transformed plant tissue culture cells capable                     
              of synthesizing functional antibody proteins has great                         
              potential for producing large quantities of specific                           
              antibodies cheaply and efficiently.  Single domain                             
              anti-lysozyme antibody cDNAs have been subcloned into a                        
              plant expression vector and introduced into cultured plant                     
              cells which will be employed for the production of antibody                    
              proteins.  Various signal peptide sequences will be tested                     
              for the efficient secretion of antibody proteins into the                      
              medium from cultured cells.  The scale-up and optimization                     
              of the cell cultivation will be carried out.  The genetic                      
              stability of the antibody-producing cells will be                              
              monitored.
