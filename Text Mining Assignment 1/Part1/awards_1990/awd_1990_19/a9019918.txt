Abstract    :
                   The funds will be used to build a new recording system for                
              Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution's Ocean Bottom Hydrophone                 
              (OBH) instruments.  The existing recording system has been                     
              extensively used for the past 14 years but is now outmoded.  The               
              replacement system was developed with the support of US Geological             
              Survey and will substantially improve capability of the                        
              instruments, extending their life by 5-10 years.  14 OBH's are                 
              planned to be updated and will be used by a wide oceanographic                 
              community.
