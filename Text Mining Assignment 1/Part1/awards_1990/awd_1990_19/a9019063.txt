Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will tackle the problem of                     
              structural prediction for membrane proteins using both a synthesis             
              of existing cross disciplinary techniques and a new set of targets             
              for the estimation of distribution parameters.  Membrane proteins              
              are important in the transport of materials into and out of cells.             
              It is a commonly recognized goal of biochemistry to understand                 
              function and mechanism at the molecular level in terms of                      
              structure.
