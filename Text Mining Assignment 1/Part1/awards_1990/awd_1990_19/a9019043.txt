Abstract    :
              With this award, the Chemistry Division will support work in                   
              the curriculum development area to be carried out by Dr. Seyhan                
              N. Ege and Dr. Brian P. Coppola of the Department of Chemistry                 
              at the University of Michigan.  The award will be used to help                 
              purchase instrumentation that will enhance the Department's                    
              systematic change of its undergraduate chemistry curriculum.                   
                                                                                             
              This change, which began in 1989, offers new courses which                     
              emphasize process and method in addition to content.  The                      
              laboratory courses, in particular, from the very first term,                   
              are structured with open-ended exercises and individualized                    
              problems to be solved.  The successful completion of these                     
              exercises requires that students have access to modern                         
              instrumentation.  It is believed that the project can be used                  
              as a prototype for revitalization of chemical curriculum in the                
              setting of a large university.
