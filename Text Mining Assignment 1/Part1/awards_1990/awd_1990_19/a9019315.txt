Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This research is a continuation and extension of an existing              
              project on the study of dynamics of tropical intraseasonal                     
              oscillation.  The objective of the study is to enhance physical                
              understanding of the complex behavior of intraseasonal                         
              disturbances in spatially varying mean tropical circulations,                  
              their interactions with the oceanic mixed layer and their roles                
              in ENSO (El Nino-southern Oscillation) evolution.  Three research              
              thrusts are proposed:                                                          
                   a)  Effects of mean tropical circulation on dynamics of the               
              intraseasonal disturbances;                                                    
                   b)  Intraseasonal variations of air-sea interface variables               
              and oceanic influence on atmospheric intraseasonal disturbances;               
                   c)  Response of ocean to intraseasonal variation of surface               
              winds and the links between intraseasonal and interannual                      
              variations.                                                                    
                   The PI will adopt a combination of theoretical and empirical              
              analysis.  A free atmosphere-boundary layer coupled model                      
              developed in the existing project will be extended to include                  
              basic flow and coupling with an ocean mixed layer model, forming               
              a dynamics framework for theoretical analysis.  Interim COADS                  
              ship reports (1980-1987) generated by global data assimilation                 
              systems of th European Center for Medium Range Weather Froecasts               
              (ECMWF), and sea-level data collected at the TOGA Sea Level                    
              Center (1975-1987) will be used for diagnostic studies.                        
                                                                                             
                   This research is important because it attempts to increase                
              the level of understanding of climate processes that influence                 
              climate variability around the world.
