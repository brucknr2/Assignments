Abstract    :
                   This award will provide support to a group from Rutgers                   
              University to pursue research in high energy physics.  The                     
              group will continue research with the AMY detector at the                      
              TRISTAN accelerator in Japan and will begin CP violation                       
              experiments at Fermilab.  The AMY detector provides data from                  
              electron-positron annihilations at a center of mass energy of                  
              60 GeV.  During the next two years the accumulated data should                 
              increase by about a factor of five over that presently                         
              recorded.  This will allow precision tests of the Standard                     
              Model of weak interactions to be made by measuring the large                   
              forward-backward charge asymmetries of the produced lepton and                 
              quark pairs.  The program to measure CP violation is centered                  
              on the measurement of the decay of neutral kaons to a final                    
              state consisting of a neutral pion, an electron and a positron.                
              In addition a future program of measuring CP violation                         
              parameters is planned for a phi-factory.
