Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will study the interaction between                  
              basaltic magma and the crust.  In particular, he will investigate              
              the possibility that partial melting of both continental and                   
              young mafic rocks as a result of this interaction coupled with                 
              subsequent fractionation during ascent, may be the dominant                    
              processes whereby evolved rocks are generated and magmatism                    
              sustained.  This work will utilize properly scaled laboratory                  
              experiments, numerical simulations, and linear stability analysis              
              of the onset of convection to help geologists better understand                
              processes responsible for the generation of igneous rocks.
