Abstract    :
              It is the purpose of this project to measure the optical clarity               
              of the Antarctic polar ice at depths of 300 meters and 1 kilometer.            
              If the ice is sufficiently transparent, then a new proposal will               
              be prepared to attempt to use the ice as a Cherenkov detector for              
              measuring very energetic neutrinos and gamma rays from                         
              astrophysical sources.
