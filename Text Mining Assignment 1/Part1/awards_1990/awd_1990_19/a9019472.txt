Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This study addresses the fate of fluvial sediment derived from                 
              the Ganges-Brahmaputra River, the single largest fluvial                       
              sourceof sediment in the world.  High-resolution seismic                       
              profiles,combined with sediment cores from which both Pb210 and                
              C14 geochronologies will be determined, will delineate the                     
              distribution and rates of sediment accumulation on the                         
              continental shelf seaward of the river mouth.  Textural and                    
              mineralogical studies will evaluate transport pathways as well                 
              as sediment sources.
