Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This laboratory has identified Drosophila mutations which disrupt              
              the release of sister chromatids at anaphase and the process of                
              cytokinesis in mitosis.  Experiments proposed will examine in                  
              molecular detail the products of two genes, "rough deal" (rod) and             
              "spaghetti squash" (sqh), whose proper functioning are essential               
              for the successful execution of anaphase and cytokinesis,                      
              respectively.  The following studies are proposed:  1) To                      
              characterize the rod and sqh proteins by immunocytochemsitry and               
              trace their intracellular distribution and behavior during mitosis;            
              2) to determine the role of phosphorylation of the sqh gene product            
              in regulating cytokinesis; 3) to dissect the function of the sqh               
              gene product through classical and in vitro mutagenesis.                       
                                                                                             
              The process of mitosis is fundamental to all eukaryotic organisms.             
              It has evolved to deliver a complete complement of chromosomes to              
              each daughter cell.  Two critical and, as yet, poorly understood               
              late events in mitosis are the release of sister chromatids at                 
              anaphase and the process of cytokinesis.  This research will take              
              advantage of two Drosophila mutations which distrupt these                     
              processes in specific ways.  The identification and analysis of the            
              products of these two genes should contribute important new                    
              information on the molecular mechanisms underlying mitosis.
