Abstract    :
                   This a planning grant to develop a full-scale proposal                    
              for the support of a community-based network of technology                     
              learning centers.  The Playing to Win Network will address                     
              the question of how to make science, and math, and technology                  
              issues relevant to the undeserved.  Over the past 8 years                      
              the Playing to Win training center has provided training to                    
              teens and young adults in the predominantly minority                           
              community of Harlem (New York City) who need familiarity with                  
              math, science, and technology in order to keep a job.  The                     
              goals of the grant are (1) to identify communities to serve                    
              as pilot sites of the network, (2) to develop collaborations                   
              to support the larger network structure, and (3) to study                      
              existing network models, financial structures, and to develop                  
              a business plan.  Once the network is in place, further                        
              research into teaching and training techniques for minorities                  
              will be pursued.
