Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              Kerogen is the major repository of carbon in the marine                        
              environment.  Two techniques used separately in the past,                      
              namely flash pyrolysis and &13C analysis, have proven useful in                
              understanding the sources and structures of kerogen and other                  
              complex cross-linked macromolecules.  This work will                           
              investigate combining these techniques in newly developed on-                  
              line systems to quantitatively determine the kinds of                          
              structural subunits present in kerogen (via pyrolysis) while at                
              the same time determining the marine and terrestrial sources of                
              organic carbon in these subunits (via &13C analys is).                         
              Ancillary techniques such as conventional Py-GC-MS and                         
              selective chemical degradation will also be used to                            
              characterize the kerogens.  This work is anticipated to provide                
              the analytical basis in the future to address two research                     
              topics, (1) whether the large pool of aliphatic carbon in                      
              surface sediments has a marine rather than terrestrial origin,                 
              as new research seems to suggest, and (2) whether it is marine                 
              or terrestrial carbon that is more susceptible to reaction with                
              sulfides in sediments, forming bioresistant "vulcanized"                       
              kerogen.
