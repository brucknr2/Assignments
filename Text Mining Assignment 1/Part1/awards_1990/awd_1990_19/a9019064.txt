Abstract    :
                   Microwave spectroscopy, with Stark ionization detection, is               
              used on fast beams of laser-excited atoms, (1) to study high                   
              angular momentum states of helium in order to test relativistic                
              and QED contributions to their structure, (2) to study such                    
              states in the H2+ ion, (3) to study such states in heavy atoms, 4              
              to measure the n=4 Lamb shift in H, and 5) to study collisional                
              properties of these high angular momentum states.
