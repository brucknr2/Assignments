Abstract    :
                   The most common process to make the YBa2Cu3O7-x superconductor            
              (1-2-3 superconductor)is that with mixed oxides as precursor                   
              materials. Co-precipitation processes, such as the all acetate                 
              precursors route, have been also used to produce 1-2-3                         
              superconductors. However, the all acetate precursor route is not               
              as widely used as the mixed oxide route because some important                 
              properties of the 1-2-3 superconductor are diminished when the                 
              former route is used. These properties include transition                      
              temperature, critical current density, strength, and the Meissner              
              effect they produce. Although the acetate route has not proven to              
              produce 1-2-3 superconductors with exceptional properties, there               
              is an interest in this co-precipitation process because it produces            
              faster superconductors and with less energy requirements than the              
              oxide precursors route.                                                        
              %%%                                                                            
                   The purpose of this research is to optimize the method to                 
              produce 1-2-3 superconductors and improve its properties using                 
              acetate precursors.
