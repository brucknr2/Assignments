Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Despite the ecological and economic importance of vertebrate                   
              suspension feeders, hypotheses about particle entrapment                       
              mechanisms inside their oral cavities have rarely been tested                  
              and the fluid mechanics of filtration  by vertebrates has not                  
              been modelled.  This project will develop a mathematical model                 
              of flow fields around and particle retention by the gill raker                 
              of blackfish (Cyprinidae), and will apply this model to                        
              Pacific herring (Clupeidae) and northern anchovy (Engraulidae).                
              Using a fiberoptic endoscope and thermistor flow probe to                      
              record the first images and  water velocities inside the oral                  
              cavity of a vertebrate suspension feeder, an unexpected                        
              filtration mechanism was documented in blackfish.  Gill rakers,                
              assumed to be the site of particle retention in fishes, act in                 
              blackfish as barriers that direct particle-laden water to the                  
              mucus-covered oral roof.  A thermistor flow probe will provide                 
              empirical values for the model parameters in herring and                       
              anchovy, and a fiberoptic endoscope will establish whether the                 
              model accurately predicts the pattern of flow at the rakers.                   
              The model will indicate the flow velocities and raker                          
              morphologies that are associated with the functioning of rakers                
              as barriers versus filters, and will be applicable to a                        
              diversity of fish species and other suspension feeders.
