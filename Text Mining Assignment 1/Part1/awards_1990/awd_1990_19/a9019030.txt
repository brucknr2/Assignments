Abstract    :
                   The objective of the proposed research is to constrain the                
              relative roles of eustacy and tectonics for the origins of                     
              Pennsylvanian cyclothems by testing how the cyclothem pattern and              
              timing in a basin directly influenced by uplift compares with the              
              pattern and timing of eustatic cyclothems.  The Desmoinesian                   
              interval in the Ardmore Basin in southern Oklahoma contains                    
              progradational sequences separated by transgressive deposits.                  
              Based on the abrupt introduction of detrital chert, a change in                
              paleocurrent directions, and the facies patterns, we suggest that              
              this interval was directly influenced by tectonic activity in the              
              Ouachita fold and thrust belt.  Development of a relative sea level            
              curve for this interval based on a genetic stratigraphic sequence              
              approach and biostratigraphic calibration of the curve will allow              
              a comparison with a eustatic curve from the Midcontinent based on              
              fusulinids, and will refine and test this correlation based on                 
              studies of conodonts and other fossil groups where present.  We                
              have a good stratigraphic framework for most of the interval based             
              on outcrop studies.  Additional sedimentologic and stratigraphic               
              studies of both outcrops and subsurface sections will be integrated            
              to develop the genetic stratigraphic sequences.
