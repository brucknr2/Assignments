Abstract    :
              We live in a time of great progress in the observational and                   
              theoretical study of the relationship of the very small and the                
              very large in our universe.  This field has come to be known as                
              Astro-Particle physics, and is concerned with such questions as                
              the nature of the dark matter which seems to "seed" galaxies and               
              clusters of galaxies, the process of formation of galaxies, and                
              the origin and age of the universe itself.  This grant provides                
              partial support for an international conference of active workers              
              studying these exciting questions.
