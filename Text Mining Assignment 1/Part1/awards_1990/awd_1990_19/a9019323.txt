Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This project will implement the initial phase of a multi-year,            
              international cooperative project to collect deep seismic                      
              reflection data across the Himalaya/Tibet Plateau collision zone,              
              the type example of a continent-continent collision.  The goal of              
              the project is to delineate the major structual features of the                
              Tibetan lithosphere that have evolved during the collision process,            
              and through this contribute substantially to an understanding of               
              the evolution of continental lithosphere as a whole.                           
                                                                                             
                   During the initial phase of the project the principal                     
              investigators intend to carry out, in cooperation with the Ministry            
              of Geology and Mineral Resources of the People's Republic of China             
              (MGMR), a test survey of approximately 100 km length in order to               
              (1) define the logistical requirements for deep reflection                     
              profiling in this unique area, and (2) address a key geologic                  
              problem relating to the evolution of the plateau.  This initial                
              test is an essential prelude to full scale profiling across the                
              Himalaya/Tibet Plateau region.
