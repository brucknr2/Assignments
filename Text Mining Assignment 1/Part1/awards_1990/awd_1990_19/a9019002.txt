Abstract    :
                   This award provides 43% funding for the acquisition of a laser            
              Raman microprobe system with multichannel detection capabilities.              
              The system is to be installed in the Department of Earth and                   
              Planetary Sciences at Washington University. Washington University             
              is committed to providing the remaining funds needed.                          
                   The Raman spectroscopy facility will assist projects such as              
              the investigation of diffusion of gas from natural gas-fluid                   
              inclusion in minerals and the role of carbon (graphite or diamond)             
              in mineral inclusions, and will be accessible to researchers in                
              other departments and to off-campus users.
