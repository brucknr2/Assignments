Abstract    :
                This research is to use western U.S. seismic network recordings              
              of local earthquakes and prior seismic refraction studies to                   
              better constrain the crustal structure under the Sierra Nevada                 
              mountains.  Recent studies have revived the controversy over                   
              whether the Sierra Nevada has a cold, deep root or whether                     
              effects interpreted as a root are caused by an unusually low-                  
              velocity, warm, extending mantle that has heated up within the                 
              last 10 my.  The results will have important implications on our               
              knowledge of the creation and tectonics of the lithosphere and                 
              upper mantle of the western U.S.
