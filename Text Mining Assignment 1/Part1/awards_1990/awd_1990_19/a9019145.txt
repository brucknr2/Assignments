Abstract    :
              This grant, in the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry                     
              Program, provides support for development and application of an                
              approximate quantum-mechanical method for predicting the                       
              structures and energies of molecules that are too large to be                  
              treated accurately, by ab initio methods.  Professor Dewar's                   
              previous work has been of immense practical utility in                         
              providing theoretical guidance to experimental organic                         
              chemists, and the present project is designed to extend that                   
              utility to molecules containing the biologically important                     
              elements phosphorus, sulfur, and various metal atoms.                          
                                                                                             
              Specifically, Professor Dewar's previous work has led to the                   
              development of parametric ("semiempirical") quantum mechanical                 
              models (MINDO/3, MNDO, AM1) which are unique in providing                      
              results of useful accuracy for large organic molecules at                      
              reasonable cost in computing time.
