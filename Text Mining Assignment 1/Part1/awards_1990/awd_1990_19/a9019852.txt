Abstract    :
                   This is a joint Clarkson-Yale University project for the                  
              investigation of novel computational techniques to exploit                     
              intrinsic characteristics of boundary element analysis (BEA), for              
              truly large scale problems on contemporary/emerging computers,                 
              removing bottlenecks to high performance computing by examining                
              steps currently consuming up to 95% of overall computational                   
              resources.  Special regard is given to the effectiveness of these              
              techniques in the design process where solution of sequences of                
              evolving problems and design sensitivity analysis are required.                
              Iterative equation solving, vector/parallel numerical integration,             
              and iterative reanalysis and design sensitivity analysis, in a high            
              performance computing environment, is being investigated.                      
                   The knowledge gained, will facilitate the use of significantly            
              more refined BEA simulations, predicting system response with                  
              increased fidelity, earlier in the engineering process, add to the             
              general efficiency of BEA vis-a-vis finite element and finite                  
              difference analysis, and help make tractable the coupling of                   
              accurate three-dimensional simulation with programmed intelligence             
              in overall analysis and optimization systems of practical utility              
              in the mainstream of engineering and design.
