Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Description:  This project supports cooperation between Dr.                    
              Richard H. Pratt of the University of Pittsburgh and Dr.                       
              P.P. Kane of the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay,                       
              India.    The main research area will be the study of                          
              elastic scattering (Rayleigh scattering) and inelastic                         
              scattering (bound-electron Compton scattering) of hard                         
              x-rays and soft gamma rays by atoms.  The focus will be on                     
              the atomic physics which appears to largely determine                          
              photon-atom scattering.  The proposed studies will also                        
              provide more accurate data needed by workers in medical                        
              diagnostics, applied radiation physics and reactor safety.                     
              Objectives include the study of near-threshold effects in                      
              elastic scattering, and improved understanding of Compton                      
              scattering from tightly-bound inner-shell electrons of                         
              high-Z atoms.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              Scope:  The work involves joint experimental and                               
              theoretical research between highly-complementary ongoing                      
              research programs in photon-atom scattering.  The U.S. and                     
              Indian scientists have successfully collaborated in                            
              research in this area in the past.  The research has both                      
              basic research interests as well as potential applications                     
              that are beneficial to scientists and radiation                                
              professionals in the two countries.  Training of students                      
              is an integral part of the project.  The project is being                      
              supported under two grants:                                                    
              INT 9019385 to the University of Pittsburgh;                                   
              INT 9102053 to the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay
