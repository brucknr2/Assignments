Abstract    :
                   This project is concerned with extending projection                       
              operator formalism and combining it with a density matrix                      
              approach in order to describe photorecombination processes.                    
              The theoretical work is laid out so that some of it may be                     
              performed by undergraduate research assistants.                                
                   The work is a continuation of previous work done by the                   
              principal investigator in collaboration with Dr. John Cooper                   
              of the University of Colorado and Dr. Verne Jacobs of the                      
              Naval Research Laboratory, and the proposed work relies on a                   
              continuation of this collaboration.
