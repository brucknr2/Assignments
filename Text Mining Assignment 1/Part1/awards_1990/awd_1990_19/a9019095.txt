Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Preliminary textural and geochemical data on Cretaceous foreland               
              basin lacustrine limestones from the Wyoming-Idaho overthrust                  
              belt indicate post-depositional stabilization of diatomaceous                  
              magnesian calcite in closed diagenetic systems.  Because                       
              resulting mixtures of calcite-dolomite-quartz micrite may                      
              preserve nearly pristine isotopic and major element signatures,                
              the project involves an expanded stratigraphic and geochemical                 
              study in order to: 1) appraise short-term climate change as                    
              recorded in microdolomite content and             variation                    
              across these areally-extensive lakes, 2) evaluate the role of                  
              climate change in predicating clastic-carbonate depositional                   
              cyclicity during foreland basin sediment accumulation, and 3)                  
              determine naturally occurring stable isotope fractionation                     
              factors and trace element distribution coefficients for the                    
              system calcite-dolomite-quartz.  The scope of this research                    
              includes secular variations and carbonate diagenesis within                    
              depositional systems leading to greater understanding of                       
              paleoclimates.  It also ties into other research supported under
