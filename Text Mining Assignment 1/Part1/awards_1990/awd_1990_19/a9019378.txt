Abstract    :
              This award supports a study to document and interpret the                      
              spore and pollen assemblages recovered from the Eocene                         
              deltaic La Meseta Formation of Seymour Island, northeastern                    
              Antarctic Peninsula.  These spores and pollen were derived                     
              from land plants growing on the Eocene Antarctic Peninsula,                    
              at a time when the land connections with the rest of                           
              Gondwana were severed.  The Eocene spore and pollen                            
              assemblages reflect the vegetation during the last interval                    
              of south polar warmth in earth history -  a time when                          
              evolutionary innovation was still apparent in the southern                     
              high latitudes.  Of special interest are postulated                            
              paleoclimatic fluctuations during Eocene, and the floristic                    
              and paleoclimatic changes near the Eocene/Oligocene boundary                   
              which may be recorded in the uppermost La Meseta Formation.
