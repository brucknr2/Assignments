Abstract    :
              This award will support Professor Nikolaos Peppas of Purdue                    
              University in a research collaboration with Professor Paolo                    
              Colombo of the University of Parma, Italy.  The researchers                    
              intend to investigate the mechanisms responsible for the                       
              transport and release of water soluble peptides from non-                      
              porous, hydrophilic polymers.  Polymer/peptide systems to be                   
              investigated include uncrosslinked poly(vinyl alcohol),                        
              poly(acrylic acid), hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose and                         
              various polymethacrylates.  Diffusion and release studies                      
              will be performed with calcitonin, trazodone, diclofenac,                      
              diltiazem and prazosin.                                                        
                                                                                             
              Controlled release systems of the swelling type are a                          
              promising new class of polymeric systems for release of drugs                  
              and biomolecules.  Although their capability to release small                  
              molecules at constant rates has been proven through previous                   
              studies, no study has been done yet for the release of high                    
              molecular weight (75,000) macromolecules.  Obvious applications                
              of this research will be in the area of release of genetically                 
              engineered molecules in target areas.  The proposed work will                  
              provide an important understanding of the coupled phenomena                    
              of diffusion/swelling/dissolution and will offer guidelines                    
              for the development of better controlled release systems.
