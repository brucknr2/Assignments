Abstract    :
              The genomic RNAs of some plant viruses contain tRNA-like structures            
              at their 3' ends.  There is a highly developed tRNA mimicry, with              
              aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase and elongation factor interacting                    
              efficiently with the Viral RNAs.  The advantages to the virus of               
              this elaborate tRNA mimicry remain unclear, but are probably                   
              involved in (-) strand synthesis, the first step of the viral                  
              replication cycle.  The goal of this proposal is to understand the             
              function of the tRNA mimicry for turnip yellow mosaic virus (TYMV).            
              The 82 nucleotide-long tRNA-like structure of TYMV specifically                
              accepts valine and appears to include the (-) strand promoter.  We             
              have shown that alteration of the -CAC-valine anticodon to a non-              
              valine anticodon results in dramatic loss of valylation in vivo.               
              Experiments are proposed to test whether the anticodon is important            
              (a) primarily in directing the valylation of the viral RNA, or (b)             
              because it is an essential recognition element of the (-) strand               
              promoter.  TYMV replicase will be purified in order to determine               
              which subunits- viral or host-encoded (e.g. elongation factor) -               
              are responsible for the recognition of the tRNA-like structure as              
              promoter.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              While mimicry at the phenotype level has been recognized as a                  
              biological phenomenon for many years, mimicry at the DNA level is              
              new and unexpected.  The information resulting from this award                 
              should give some insight into cause.
