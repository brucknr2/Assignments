Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The P.I.s have been funded for 8 days of ALVIN dives to                   
              establish the chronology of active hydrothermal vents at the                   
              Fairy castle site on the Endeavor segment of the Juan de Fuca                  
              Ridge. Both old and new samples will be used to: 1) provided                   
              isotopic and mineralogic measurements: 2) test assumptions of the              
              dating methods; 3) map the chimneys in the study area; 4) model                
              the growth of these chimneys. Visual and analytical data will be               
              compared between the new and old samples. Dating will be based on              
              the disequilibria among isotopes of the U and The decay series,                
              specifically th228/Ra228,Ra228/Ra226 and Pb210/Pb. Fluids                      
              collected by ALVIN will be analyzed and accompaying mineralogic                
              studies will be performed under separate contracts to J. Edmond                
              (MIT) and M. Tivey (WHOI), respectively. Benefits will include                 
              and evaluation of the Th228 and Pb210 dating techniques and                    
              forman improved understanding of the temporal mineralogic and                  
              fluid evolution of hydrothermal vent systems.
