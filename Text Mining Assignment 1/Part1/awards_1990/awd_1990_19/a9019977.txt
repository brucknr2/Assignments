Abstract    :
                   This project will carry out two initiatives in support of                 
              the research activities of the Long-Term Ecological Research                   
              Network (LTER).  Specifically, these initiatives are acquisition               
              of remote sensing imagery for each of the LTER research sites,                 
              and for the installation and development of a system to enhance                
              connectivity of the LTER Network.  The remote sensing acquisition              
              will provide a consistent and comparable database for                          
              collaborative research within LTER as well as providing a                      
              historical record for future research.  This acquisition will                  
              provide a common database for LTER as well as the larger                       
              ecological community associated with LTER research.  The remote                
              sensing initiative requests digital satellite, and hard-copy                   
              aircraft imagery for each of the LTER research sites.  The                     
              connectivity initiative will enhance communication within and                  
              beyond the LTER Network and will be fundamental for future                     
              database management activities.  This initiative is seen as a                  
              first step in connectivity efforts within LTER as recommended in               
              the LTER Connectivity Report.  The connectivity initiative will                
              support the installation and development of a computer                         
              communication system for mail and data exchange, which will be                 
              accessible via wide-area networks, by members of the LTER Network              
              as well as outside researchers working with LTER.  This system is              
              envisioned as a major link for information exchange not only with              
              LTER, but also for the larger ecological community.
