Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Problems of nonlinear magnetohydrodynamic stability are                        
              of considerable interest in the framework of geophysics                        
              as well as of fundamental importance in physics.  It is                        
              anticipated that combining the complementary expertise                         
              of U.S. and Soviet scientists will lead to significant                         
              results related to better understanding of the fundamental                     
              mechanisms by which the Earth's magnetic field as well                         
              as planetary and solar magnetic fields behave and are                          
              generated.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              This U.S.-U.S.S.R. cooperative scientific workshop,                            
              organized by Dr. Susan Friedlander of the University of                        
              Illinois at Chicago and Dr. M. M. Vishik of the USSR                           
              Academy of Sciences' International Institute of Earthquake                     
              Prediction Theory and Mathematical Geophysics, will bring                      
              together distinguished scientists from the United States                       
              and the Soviet Union whose range of expertise covers                           
              applied mathematics, mathematical physics, astrophysics,                       
              and geophysics.  It is expected that this initial                              
              meeting will generate further long-term collaborative                          
              activities in this field.                                                      
                                                                                             
              This project fulfills the program objective of advancing                       
              scientific knowledge by enabling leading researchers in                        
              the United States and the U.S.S.R. to combine comple-                          
              mentary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong                            
              mutual interest and competence in the field of basic                           
              scientific research on the basis of equality, reciprocity,                     
              and mutuality of benefit.
