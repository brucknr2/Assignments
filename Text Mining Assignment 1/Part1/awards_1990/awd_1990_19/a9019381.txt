Abstract    :
                  This action provides funds for a project that will examine                 
              alternative approaches for a survey of immigrant scientists                    
              and engineers and will include estimates of the costs and                      
              benefits of each approach.  This work is needed before finalizing              
              the design for the survey of immigrants which will be an integral              
              part of STPDS for the 1990's.
