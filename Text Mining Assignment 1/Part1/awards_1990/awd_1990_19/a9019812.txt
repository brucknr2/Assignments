Abstract    :
              The importance of marine macroalgae in coastal food webs of the                
              Antarctic Peninsula is not well known.  Dr. Kenneth Dunton, using              
              marine flora and fauna collected from several sites on the                     
              Antarctic Peninsula, proposes to determine the contribution of                 
              macroalgal carbon to the rich benthic communities by using stable              
              carbon and nitrogen isotopic signatures.  The density of coastal               
              macroalgae is extremely high, the productivity of which probably               
              matches or exceeds that of the local phytoplankton.  The                       
              hypothesis to be tested is that macroalgae serve as an important               
              dietary carbon source of many benthic and epibenthic fauna, as                 
              recently demonstrated for kelps in low latitudes.  The stable                  
              isotopic analysis of the collected fauna and flora will provide                
              an unique opportunity to evaluate the contribution of macroalgal               
              carbon in high latitude food webs, as well as trophic relations                
              and feeding strategies of marine fauna on the Antarctic                        
              Peninsula.
