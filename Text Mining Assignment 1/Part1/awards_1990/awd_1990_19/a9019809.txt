Abstract    :
              This project proposes an innovative multi-layered array of                     
              computing elements in which dynamic reconfiguration of the                     
              interconnection structure is possible.  Reconfiguration will be                
              performed using distributed control, eliminating a potential                   
              performance bottleneck and single point failure (hardcore) of a                
              centralized control mechanism.  An architecture of this type                   
              provides an increased level of system performance not typically                
              found in current parallel processing systems.  Through the                     
              reconfiguration process, the underlying architecture can be                    
              optimized to improve algorithm performance, faulty modules can be              
              isolated, and the yield of wafer scale based technology can be                 
              improved.                                                                      
              They plan to investigate this architecture for more efficient                  
              utilization of spares and to provide on line fault detection and               
              data roll-back features.  Second, they propose to optimize the                 
              reconfiguration algorithm for cost effective implementation in the             
              emerging wafer scale integration technology.  Finally they plan to             
              extend the reconfiguration algorithm to permit its use on                      
              alternative parallel processing architectures such as hypercubes               
              and tori.
