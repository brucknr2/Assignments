Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research is designed to reveal the generally                              
              simple, fundamental chemical factors which underlie the                        
              relatively complex behavior of rare earth elements in oceanic,                 
              estuarine and riverine environments.  Chemical associations of                 
              the rare earths with dominant solution ligands (carbonate and                  
              phosphate) will be investigated. Solid/solution equilibrium                    
              partitioning of rare earths between seawater and selected solid                
              surfaces (calcium carbonate, silicates, iron oxides, and                       
              organics) will be examined as a function of seawater solution                  
              conditions.  Methods will be developed which will permit                       
              assessment of the role of dissolved natural organics on rare                   
              earth element behavior in the environment.  This work should                   
              provide improved capabilities for modeling the behavior of rare                
              earth elements and transplutonium elements in natural systems.
