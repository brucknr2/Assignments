Abstract    :
                   Research is conducted to gain an understanding of the                     
              electronic and radiative processes which occur during the                      
              collision of two atoms:  ionization, excitation, and captive of                
              electrons and emission of photons.  The present emphasis is on                 
              the role played by direct electron-electron interactions in the                
              collision process, the interaction between an electron of the                  
              target atom, and one or more of the electrons on the projectile.
