Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              The objective of the proposed research is to define a                          
              theoretical framework for logic-based geometric spatial                        
              reasoning and to develop models to support the framework.                      
              A theoretical framework will formalize the relation and                        
              will find use in several applications such as the                              
              integration of computer-aided design and manufacturing,                        
              automatic interpretation of non-invasive solid scanning                        
              technologies, and three-dimensional pattern recognition.                       
              The approach for the proposed research will involve the                        
              consideration of extant solid modelling paradigms and                          
              their geometric entities, the description and modelling of                     
              these entities in logical form, the development of the                         
              theoretical framework and supporting proofs and example                        
              models.  The logic-based geometric spatial reasoning in                        
              hardwood log processing will be used as a primary                              
              illustration, though other applications will also be                           
              considered.
