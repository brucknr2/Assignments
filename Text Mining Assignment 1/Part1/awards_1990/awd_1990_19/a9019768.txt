Abstract    :
              Progress in the field of knowledge-based programming has been held up          
              because of the tremendous investment needed to build an experimental           
              testbed.  The objective of this project is to provide an open research         
              system to other investigators by preparing the Kestrel Interactive             
              Development System (KIDS) for distribution to educational and research         
              institutions and to provide ongoing maintenance and support to off-            
              site users.  KIDS is a knowledge-based system that supports the                
              development of correct and efficient programs from formal                      
              specifications.  KIDS' features include formal specifications, highly          
              automated support for correctness-preserving program transformations,          
              ease of use through a point-and-click-style graphic interface, and             
              representations for a wide varity of programming knowledge.  The               
              system has components for performing algorithm design, deductive               
              inference, program simplificaiton, partial evaluation, finite                  
              differencing optimizations, data type refinement and other development         
              operations.  Generally KIDS can be viewed as a system for performing           
              semantics-preserving transformations on complex linguistically-                
              expressed objects.
