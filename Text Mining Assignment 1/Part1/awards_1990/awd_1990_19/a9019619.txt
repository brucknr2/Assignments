Abstract    :
                   This award covers network router equipment for nine                       
              institutions which are members of the North Carolina statewide                 
              CONCERT network.  The IP routers replace LAN (local area network)              
              bridges.  Further, by including these institutions in a National               
              Science Foundation award, it enables them to obtain lower dues from            
              SURANET, the mid-level network serving North Carolina.
