Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will study the petrogenesis of the                  
              anorthosite-mangerite association.  He will integrate field,                   
              petrological, and geochemical techniques to determine the                      
              parental magmas and differentiation mechanisms of massif                       
              anorthosites, the causes of the anorthosite-mangerite                          
              association, the nature of mafic and oxide-rich lithologies, and               
              the origin and significance of iron-titanium ore deposits.  The                
              work will be done in the St.Urbain/Charlevoix, Labrieville, and                
              Morin regions of Quebec.  The project will help geologists better              
              understand the origins of this important group of igneous rocks.
