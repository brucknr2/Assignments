Abstract    :
              The development of more efficient methods for storing genome-                  
              related information into computer systems and software applications            
              for data analysis are important aspects of the Human Genome                    
              initiative and of other genome projects currently underway.  The               
              need to develop improved computer-assisted information repositories            
              is obvious; genome-related research is producing massive amounts               
              of data that cannot be adequately modelled using currently                     
              relational database technologies.                                              
                                                                                             
              This project will test the hypothesis that the object-oriented                 
              approach outperforms the relational approach for modelling genome-             
              related data.  In addition, this project will test whether the                 
              object-oriented approach provides a better interface development               
              environment that the  relational approach.                                     
                                                                                             
              E. coli genome data will be used to develop an object-oriented                 
              prototype database that contains genetic maps, physical maps, DNA              
              sequences, and transposon insertion sites.  For prototyping, the               
              most recent version of a second generation object-oriented                     
              database, ONTOS from Ontologic, Inc., will be used.
