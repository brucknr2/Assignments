Abstract    :
              This award is to complete development work on the techniques                   
              required for the analysis of Os isotopes by sputter induced                    
              resonant ionization mass spectrometry (SIRIMS) using Lamont's new              
              V. G. Isolab 54 mass spectrometer, and to begin scientific                     
              investigations using Re-Os.  In conjunction with making the mass               
              spec operational, research goals will also be pursued.   Most of               
              the research effort over the coming year will be directed toward               
              characterizing Re-Os distributions and systematics in samples                  
              acquired from various ancient terranes.  In addition, the PIs                  
              will begin to investigate Re-Os systematics in basalts and                     
              peridotite nodules to gain a better understanding of the                       
              partitioning of Re and Os during partial melting in the mantle.
