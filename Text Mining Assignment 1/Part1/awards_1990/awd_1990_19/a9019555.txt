Abstract    :
                   This award provides 50% funding for the acquisition of                    
              computational facilities to be installed in the Department of                  
              Geology and Geophysics at the University of Wisconsin. The                     
              University of Wisconsin is committed to providing the remaining                
              funds needed. The computer system is to be used by the geophysics              
              group at Wisconsin in a variety of computationally intensive                   
              research projects in seismology, glaciology and tectonophysics.
