Abstract    :
              We will study the stability of specific chemical elements and                  
              measure the mass of certain types of biological substances and                 
              embedding materials as a function of irradiation and temperature.              
              We will use an electron energy loss spectrometer interfaced to a               
              computer to make quantitative measurements.  While this work is                
              going on, we will develop a more efficient data acquisition                    
              system based on new interfaces and computer programs.  To measure              
              very cold specimens, we will mount our spectrometer on a special               
              electron microscope with a superconducting objective lens                      
              operating at liquid helium temperature.  This will help future                 
              research efforts because very low temperature will probably                    
              stabilize some elements, hence improving the accuracy of                       
              concentration measurements and allowing the use of certain                     
              chemical elements as site-specific stains.  We will learn which                
              elements are "caged at low temperature or "frozen" onto surfaces.              
              Improved stability of embedding materials will allow more                      
              accurate three-dimensional views of sectioned specimens.  Studies              
              of major classes of molecules (like DNA) will indicate which                   
              materials are most helped by low temperature.  Development of new              
              instrumentation will improve the efficiency of our studies of                  
              radiation effects and will allow our techniques to be used more                
              widely by other.
