Abstract    :
                   The object of this research is the measurement and                        
              interpretation of radar reflectivity, including polarization,                  
              using the CHILL radar during the WISP experiment (15 January - 15              
              March 1991) in Central Colorado.  This attempt to infer the                    
              distribution of water substance and its evolution in winter                    
              clouds will be assisted by direct measurement of cloud                         
              composition using instrumental aircraft and various remote                     
              sensing devices operated by other research groups.
