Abstract    :
                   The proposed project is to examine the effects that partially             
              penetrating wells and ellipsoidal inhomogeneities have on the                  
              three-dimensional capture zone.  The results of this project will              
              help determine whether modeled pump-out systems are actually                   
              performing as predicted, for certain cases. Preliminary                        
              recommendations on improvement of pump-out system design could come            
              out of this work. The most important issues to be explored are: 1)             
              the importance to model wells as partially penetrating; 2) the                 
              relationship between the depth and width of the three-dimensional              
              capture zone and the discharge rate of the partially penetrating               
              well; 3) the effect that ellipsoidal inhomogeneities have on the               
              width and depth of the capture zone of a partially penetrating                 
              well, as compared to the homogeneous aquifer. This work will be                
              done for the purpose of developing more realistic and useful                   
              modeling techniques for use in pump-out system design. Development             
              of engineering heuristics and tools will be the final outcome.
