Abstract    :
              This award is made as the starter grant increment of Dr.                       
              Chenault's Postdoctoral Fellowship in Chemistry Award in                       
              support of his research at the University of Delaware. The                     
              thrust of Dr. Chenault's research is the chemoenzymatic                        
              synthesis of sugar phosphates, disaccharides and                               
              oligosaccharides.                                                              
                                                                                             
              New strategies will be developed for the regio- and                            
              stereoselective formation of glycosides.  Phosphorylated                       
              sugars, both natural and unnatural, will be prepared as target                 
              molecules, as precursors to oligosaccharides, and as part of                   
              phosphorylated oligosaccharides having new biological and                      
              physicochemical properties. In principle, enzymatic methods are                
              ideally suited to the regio- and stereoselective manipulation                  
              of minimally protected saccharides.  Once the synthetic                        
              methodology is established, the chemistry of the derived                       
              compounds as biomechanistic, diagnostic and therapeutic tools                  
              will be explored.
