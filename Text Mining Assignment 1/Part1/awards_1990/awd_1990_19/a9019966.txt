Abstract    :
                   This work will continue a program of theoretical studies                  
              of atomic collisions on the topics 1) extracting dynamical                     
              parameters from collision data 2) R-matrix calculations of                     
              dissociative attachment and 3) analysis of fragmentation                       
              processes.
