Abstract    :
                   The object of this research is an evaluation of the                       
              stability-dependent terms of the equation for the budget of                    
              turbulent kinetic energy in the lower atmosphere.  Theory gives                
              the form of this important relation, but the contributions made                
              by various mechanisms involved must be evaluated by experiment.                
              Previous evaluations, many obtained more than 20 years ago, are                
              now considered uncertain.  This project will use improved                      
              equipment and will work jointly with scientists from the CSIRO                 
              Centre for Environmental Mechanics, Canberra, Australia, to carry              
              out a complete study of the turbulence budget in the first 16 m                
              over an extensive, treeless plain in New South Wales.                          
              Observations will be made over a wide range of atmospheric                     
              stability and will include simultaneous measurements of mean wind              
              profiles, turbulence spectra, net radiation, vertical gradients                
              of air temperature and dew point, rates of thermal exchange                    
              across the soil-air interface, and the vertical turbulent fluxes               
              of turbulent energy, momentum, and heat.
