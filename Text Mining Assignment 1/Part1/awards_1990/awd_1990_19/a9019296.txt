Abstract    :
                   The PI will carry out modeling and diagnostic studies to                  
              investigate the interannual variability and predictability of the              
              monthly and seasonal average circulation of the atmosphere.  The               
              long term goal is to investigate the predictability of the                     
              coupled ocean-atmosphere-land system.  To accomplish this                      
              objective, the strategy is to utilize realistic models of the                  
              individual components (atmosphere, ocean, and land surface                     
              processes) to carry out sensitivity and predictability studies,                
              first to examine the predictability of each component separately,              
              and ultimately to examine the predictability of the coupled                    
              interactive system.  The PI and his group will continue their                  
              ongoing research on the predictability of space-time averaged                  
              atmospheric circulation to establish a physical basis for, and                 
              demonstrate the feasibility of dynamic extended range                          
              forecasting.                                                                   
                   To accomplish the above objective the PI will continue to                 
              improve the NMC-derived atmospheric general circulation model so               
              that its ability to simulate the annual cycle and interannual                  
              variability including space-time fluctuations is further                       
              improved.  He will also use this model in conjunction with real                
              observed states of the global atmosphere and global boundary                   
              conditions at the earth's surface to investigate the                           
              predictability of the regional space-time averaged circulation                 
              of the atmosphere.                                                             
                   This research is important because it will provide a readily              
              applied basis for improvements  in operational weather and                     
              climate prediction models.
