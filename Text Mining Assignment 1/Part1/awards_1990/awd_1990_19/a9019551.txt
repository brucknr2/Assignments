Abstract    :
              Currently a need exists for accurate,                                          
              dependable microsensors which can                                              
              communicate to the observer data                                               
              associated with processes which may be at                                      
              the molecular level or the parts per billion                                   
              to trillion range.  Surface acoustic wave                                      
              (SAW) technology offers one of the most                                        
              attractive methods to realize the                                              
              microsensor. The SAW gas microsensor                                           
              basically consists of twin SAW delay lines.                                    
              Each line is configured as an oscillator and                                   
              the propagation path of one contains a                                         
              selectively sorbent film while the other is                                    
              the uncoated reference. Phase delay changes                                    
              induced by the gas sorbed on the film                                          
              results in frequency shifts which are directly                                 
              proportional to the gas concentration.                                         
              An interdisciplinary effort which includes                                     
              the theory, design, fabrication and testing of                                 
              SAW devices and the physics and chemistry                                      
              of surfaces is ongoing at the University of                                    
              Maine to realize the potential of this sensor.                                 
              The purpose of the present renewal project                                     
              is to continue the ongoing experimental and                                    
              theoretical study of the SAW gas                                               
              microsensor. The sensing film being used is                                    
              tungsten trioxide (WO3) and the gas being                                      
              sensed is hydrogen sulfide (H2S).                                              
              Microscopic and macroscopic experimental                                       
              tools are being used in order to study and                                     
              optimize sensor properties such as                                             
              selectivity, sensitivity, operating range sensor                               
              signature, response time, recovery time,                                       
              reproducibility and aging.
