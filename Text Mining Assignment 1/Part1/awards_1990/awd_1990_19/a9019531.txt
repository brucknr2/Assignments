Abstract    :
              There exists an urgent need to develop new and critical control                
              methodologies that will explicitly address the multiple                        
              performance requirements of controlled mechanical systems, while               
              deemphasizing absolute reliance on very accurate process models.               
              The problem can be stated as follows; given a process model with               
              mixed uncertainty, a set of performance specifications, and a                  
              high frequency stability margin, develop a controller which will               
              provide output performance within the given tolerances and                     
              simultaneously maintain closed loop stability in the presence of               
              the uncertainties.This research uses the frequency response                    
              method of quantitative feedback theory to investigate (1) the                  
              design of control systems for complex mechanical systems whose                 
              models display low frequency parametric uncertainty as well as                 
              high frequency flexibility effects, (2) the development of                     
              control algorithms for high performance trackiing accuracy of                  
              such systems, and (3) the  experimental validation of the                      
              algorithms on an electrohydraulic rig.
