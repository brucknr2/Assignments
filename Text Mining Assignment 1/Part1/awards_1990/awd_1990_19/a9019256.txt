Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will study the origin and movement of               
              fluids which have interacted with high-grade metamorphic terrances             
              in the East Humboldt Range, Nevada, utilizing field, petrologic,               
              and isotopic techniques. He will attempt to constrain relationships            
              between porosity, flux, and time, and will use isotopic information            
              to assess relative porosities, and to establish a qualititative and            
              quantitative scale of effective permeability in crustal                        
              lithologies. Results will help geologists understand the role of               
              fluids during the metamorphism of rocks in the Earth's crust.
