Abstract    :
                   A broad program of research on the magnetically ordered phases            
              of solid 3He is proposed.  The plan is to investigate magnetic                 
              ordering over a wide range of temperature, molar volume and                    
              magnetic field.  Measurements will be made of the melting pressure,            
              specific heat, pressure at constant volume, magnetization, and NMR             
              line-width and relaxation times.                                               
                   The results should provide a significant advance in our                   
              understanding of this model magnetic system.
