Abstract    :
              The Pliocene-aged "Pinecrest Sand" of southwestern Florida is                  
              possibly unique in the abundance density and diversity of fossil               
              mollusks it contains.  The Pinecrest is today exposed only in                  
              man-made excavations and these excavations are often very short-               
              lived.  Two pit complexes are exceptions.  The pits of APAC                    
              Florida, Inc. and Quality Aggregates, Inc. are extensive, long-                
              standing operations which give ample opportunity for sampling and              
              examination of fossiliferous strata in situ.  The APAC pit,                    
              however, is due to be closed and reclaimed as a lake by early to               
              mid-1991.  Although the Quality Aggregates operation will                      
              continue beyond this date, individual pits are in the process of               
              being reclaimed right now.  Extensive sampling and preliminary                 
              interpretation of the taxonomy and distribution of the gastropods              
              in the Pinecrest sand exposed in these pits will be conducted                  
              before their reclamation makes further study impossible.
