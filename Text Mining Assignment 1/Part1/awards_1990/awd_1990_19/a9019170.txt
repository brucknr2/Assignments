Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Second Biennial Mammalian Developmental Genetics Workshop                  
              will be held Bar Harbor, 11-15 September, 1991.  This second                   
              meeting builds on the highly successful workshop held in Bar                   
              Harbor in 1989.  Emphasis will be placed on the mouse as a model               
              species, with sessions on mouse developmental mutations,                       
              imprinting, the genetic control of gametogenesis, the genetic                  
              control of morphogenesis, the genetic control of lineage                       
              determination and functional analysis of developmental genes                   
              through gene targeting.  There will be an informal afternoon                   
              discussion of the Genetic Control of Implantation led by an                    
              invited speaker.  Keynote presentations will focus on genes that               
              control development in insects and mammals, and on the genetics                
              of human development.  Each session will begin with an invited 60              
              minute presentation providing an overview of the research                      
              problems and progress for the subject of that section.  These                  
              overviews will be followed by three 20 minute more narrowly                    
              focused, complementary presentations.  Participation of graduate               
              students and postdoctoral fellows is encouraged.
