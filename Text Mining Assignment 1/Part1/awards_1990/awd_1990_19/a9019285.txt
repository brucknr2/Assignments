Abstract    :
               This renewal project addresses the role of the plant cytoskeleton             
              during plant development, with emphasis on the reorganization of               
              microtubule arrays during the life of a cell.  Attention will be               
              focussed on a system found to be advantageous in prior studies, the            
              dividing generative cell of Tradescantia, which features what                  
              appears to be reutilization of Mts in different arrays.  The                   
              questions to be addressed include the mechanism governing                      
              conversion of interphase microtubule bundles into kinetochore                  
              fibers, the manner in which kinetochore fibers and surrounding                 
              microtubules are reorganized into large superbundles during                    
              anaphase, the role of this reorganization in chromosome motion, the            
              mechanism governing constriction cytokinesis, and the role of                  
              chromosome volume and physical constraints in the architecture of              
              the division apparatus.  Principal approaches include                          
              immunofluorescence techniques, conventional and confocal laser                 
              scanning microscopy, electron microscopy, analyses of proteins in              
              isolated generative cells, and the use of related species of                   
              different ploidy levels.                                                       
                                                                                             
              The long term goal of this work is to understand the mechanisms                
              governing reorganization of microtubules in plant cells.                       
              Microtubules are important and dynamic structural elements in all              
              eukaryotic cells, and are known to play significant roles in the               
              development and maintenance of cell shape, intracellular movement              
              of subcellular particles, and in the segregation of chromosomes                
              during cell division.
