Abstract    :
              Antarctic fish live in waters that are perennially at the freezing             
              point of body fluids.  These waters would be devoid of fish if                 
              these fish had not evolved biological antifreeze molecules to avoid            
              freezing.  The evolutionary aspects of antifreezes in Antarctic                
              fish possess considerable scientific interest.  Dr. Arthur DeVries             
              began his studies on antifreezes in Antarctic fish over three                  
              decades ago and has systematically investigated the mechanism by               
              which antifreezes confer freezing avoidance on the whole animal.               
              This research project will continue the study of how antifreezes               
              evolved in the Antarctic fishes by examining the physiological and             
              mechanistic processes involved in freezing tolerance.                          
              Physiological studies include synthesis of antifreezes and factors             
              that govern synthesis, secretion, fluid and tissue transport, and              
              conservation of antifreezes.  Mechanistic studies focus on                     
              understanding how antifreezes adsorb to ice and inhibit ice crystal            
              growth.  Aside from the intrinsic value of the project, freezing               
              avoidance in fish could have implications to the fields of human               
              pathologies, in nucleation theory, and in crystallography.
