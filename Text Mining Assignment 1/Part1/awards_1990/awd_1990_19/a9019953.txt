Abstract    :
                   Recent technological developments have brought on a revolution            
              in the design and operation of warehousing systems. Trends in                  
              manufacturing such as the just-in-time operating philosophy have               
              produced an increased demand for efficient storage/retrieval                   
              systems. Within the fields of inventory control, warehousing, and              
              order picking, significant research has been conducted in the                  
              development of operating philosophies, analytical models, and                  
              control algorithms. Much of this theoretical research has yet to               
              be applied successfully to actual situations. There is real need               
              for the integration of current material handling knowledge and for             
              the development of systems to apply this theory and research to                
              manufacturing and warehousing.                                                 
              %%%                                                                            
                   The objective of this research is to develop an expert system             
              that will address the issue of dynamic control of a warehouse                  
              system that experiences changing control variables and changing                
              constraints. A system which will build upon the current sequencing             
              knowledge and research and broadens its scope to apply to a real               
              world dynamic system.
