Abstract    :
              This is a collaborative experiment between NASA Marshall Space                 
              Flight Center, Louisiana State University, University of                       
              Washington, University of Alabama in Huntsville and University of              
              Tokyo, Japan.  The experiment involves the long duration balloon               
              borne flight (approximately 1 to 2 weeks) of blocks of sensitive               
              photographic emulsion from McMurdo, Antarctica.  The interaction               
              of extremely high energy (1-1000 TeV) cosmic rays with the emulsion            
              chambers allows the investigators to study the chemical composition            
              and energy spectra of the cosmic rays, and also allows study of                
              nuclear interactions at these very high energies.                              
                                                                                             
              This is part of an ongoing series of such experiments, but the                 
              first from Antarctica, of the Japanese-American Cooperative                    
              Emulsion Experiment (JACEE).  The flight is also intended as a test            
              for a similar experiment that is scheduled to fly on Space Station             
              Freedom as part of Astromag.
