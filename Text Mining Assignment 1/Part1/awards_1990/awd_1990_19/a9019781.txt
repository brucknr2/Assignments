Abstract    :
                This three-year proposal requests funds to establish a                       
              Minority Scholar Program for graduate and undergraduate                        
              physics majors Research Assistantship support is requested                     
              for three minority Graduate Scholars who will be selected                      
              competitively to do doctoral research with a faculty                           
              supervisor in one of the Department's many exciting research                   
              areas.  This will be augmented each year by ongoing special                    
              Institute Fellowships which provide full support for three                     
              minority students pursuing Ph.D.s in Physics.  All six                         
              graduate students participating in this Minority Scholar                       
              Program will be designated as Graduate Scholars.  Many of the                  
              Department's undergraduates are introduced to physics                          
              research through MIT's Undergraduate Research Opportunity                      
              Program (UROP), which is recognized as a national leader in                    
              university research programs for undergraduates.                               
                This proposal also requests funds to support five                            
              Undergraduate Scholars selected competitively from the                         
              under-represented minority students.  Undergraduate Scholars                   
              supported through the Minority Scholar Program will work                       
              closely with individual faculty supervisors.  Historically,                    
              the UROP program has been very effective in involving                          
              undergraduates in stimulating, front-line physics research.
