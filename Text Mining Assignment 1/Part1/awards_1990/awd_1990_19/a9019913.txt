Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Description:  Under this project support is provided to ten                    
              U.S. scientists to participate in an Indo-U.S. Workshop and                    
              Seminar on Zeolite Heterogeneous Catalysis, planned for                        
              February 10-13, 1991 in Baroda, India.  The focus of the                       
              meeting will be on various aspects of zeolite catalysis,                       
              including zeolite synthesis, characterization, adsorptive                      
              properties, and diffusion phenomena in zeolites.                               
              Approximately 12 Indian scientists will participate and                        
              discuss recent research results with the U.S. participants.                    
              Formal presentations will be supplemented with time for                        
              informal discussions.  Areas for research will be identified                   
              where new initiatives may be jointly made.  A report of the                    
              meeting will be distributed to members of the Catalysis                        
              Society in the U.S. and Canada and to the members of the                       
              Catalysis Society of India.                                                    
                                                                                             
              Scope:  The proposed workshop is organized in India by                         
              Dr. T.S.R. Prasada Rao, Secretary of the Catalysis Society of                  
              India, with support from the president of the society,                         
              Dr. S.K. Patil of the Department of Chemistry at the Indian                    
              Institute of Technology in Madras.  The topic is of                            
              fundamental scientific importance and has significant                          
              practical applications in the U.S. and India.  The workshop                    
              is likely to enhance U.S.-India scientific collaboration.
