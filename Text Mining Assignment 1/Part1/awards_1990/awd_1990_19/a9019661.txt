Abstract    :
                   To elucidate the nature of the heavy-fermion superconductor U1-           
              xThxBe13, measurements are made of the superconducting and magnetic            
              phase boundaries, and of the dc magnetization as a function of                 
              magnetic field and temperature.                                                
                   Heavy-fermion systems are of particular interest as they                  
              differ from normal metals in having relatively enormous values of              
              low-temperature specific heat and magnetic susceptibility.  The                
              appearance of superconductivity in such media is further surprising            
              and intriguing.
