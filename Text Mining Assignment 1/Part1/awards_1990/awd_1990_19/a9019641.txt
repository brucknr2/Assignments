Abstract    :
              This Faculty Award for Women Scientists and Engineers is made                  
              to Dr. Sylvia T. Ceyer of the Department of Chemistry at the                   
              Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  Ceyer will initiate a                  
              new project integrating laser spectroscopy with molecular beam                 
              surface techniques.  The goal of the project is to determine                   
              the contribution of electronic effects to the interaction of                   
              molecules with surfaces.  The difference in vibrational energy                 
              of molecules scattered from excited and unexcited silicon                      
              surfaces is attributable to the electronic component of the                    
              interaction.

              The NSF Faculty Award for Women recognizes the high quality of                 
              the awardee's record in teaching and scholarship as well as                    
              potential for continued significant contributions to scientific                
              research, the academic profession, and the education of future                 
              scientists.  Particularly noteworthy achievements are Ceyer's                  
              research on the dynamics of molecule-surface interaction and                   
              outstanding undergraduate teaching.
