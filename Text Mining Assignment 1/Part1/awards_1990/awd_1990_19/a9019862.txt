Abstract    :
              The gap between huge data requirements of many applications and                
              limited capabilities of transmission and storage systems dictated              
              the need for developing high-performance data compression hardware.            
              This research focuses on the study and implementation of                       
              nonstationary multi-alphabet source coding algorithms suitable for             
              VLSI implementations, given the current and near-future technology;            
              the implementation of high-throughput circuits for real-time                   
              applications; and the determination of an optimal tradeoff between             
              the compression performance and circuit configurations given                   
              constrained chip area.  The developed algorithms and circuits are              
              excepted to offer more cost-effective data compression for                     
              communication and storage systems.
