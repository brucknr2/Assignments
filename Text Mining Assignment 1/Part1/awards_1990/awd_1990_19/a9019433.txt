Abstract    :
                   This proposal in mathematical physics has as its goals: 1)                
              to evaluate effects of many-electron correlations in problems                  
              relevant to high temperature superconductivity 2) to obtain                    
              accurate, non-perturbative estimates for ionization problems 3)                
              to study non-linear Skyrmion equations in relation to symmetry                 
              breaking 4) to resolve a long standing conjecture about                        
              permanent dominance in matrix theory.
