Abstract    :
                The academic development of tomorrow's mathematicians                        
              require a vision of the future and a program to achieve that                   
              vision.  Spelman College has that vision.  The project                         
              "Scholars in Mathematics at Spelman (SIMS) will provide a                      
              comprehensive research and academic enrichment program for                     
              talented minority  women students.  The overall objective of                   
              the program is to develop an academic  environment that                        
              assures the preparedness of minority women as they pursue                      
              degrees in mathematics at the best graduate schools throughout                 
              the country.  The students selected to participate in the                      
              program will be mathematics majors that have demonstrated                      
              potential for earning a graduate degree in pure or applied                     
              mathematics.  Each student's academic program at Spelman will                  
              include   enrichment activities such as participation in a                     
              research issues course, supervised mathematics research,                       
              seminar participation, and conference attendance.                              
                During the first year, four students will be selected for                    
              the program:  two sophomores and two juniors.  Subsequently,                   
              two rising sophomores will be selected immediately following                   
              the spring semester each year of the grant.  Each student will                 
              engage in at least two years of research experience with                       
              faculty advisors culminating in a written thesis.  Two summer                  
              research experiences will include at least one internship at                   
              an off-campus research facility or university.
