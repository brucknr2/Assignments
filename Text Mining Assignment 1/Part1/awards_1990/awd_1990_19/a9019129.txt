Abstract    :
              With support from the Organic Dynamics Program, Dr. Hopkins                    
              will study the chemical structures of two DNA interstrand                      
              crosslinks, i.e., those that result from reaction of DNA (i)                   
              with a nitrogen mustard and (ii) with an analog of reductively                 
              activated mitomycin C. An investigation of the mechanism by                    
              which mitomycin analogs preferentially crosslink 5'-CG                         
              sequences in DNA will be performed along with studies of the                   
              sequence preferences of several other interstrand DNA                          
              crosslinking agents.                                                           
              %%%                                                                            
              DNA interstrand covalent crosslinking reactions involve                        
              addition of a nucleophilic center on DNA to an electrophilic                   
              center of the crosslinking agent. These are fundamentally                      
              simple chemical reactions that take place on a structurally and                
              dynamically complex macromolecule. Dr. Hopkins' study is                       
              designed to provide information regarding the covalent                         
              structures of crosslinked DNAs at the nucleotide level and in                  
              some cases will provide information regarding atomic                           
              connectivities. Information that Dr. Hopkins obtained from                     
              these studies is likely to lead to simplification and                          
              improvement in the design of new DNA crosslinking agents.
