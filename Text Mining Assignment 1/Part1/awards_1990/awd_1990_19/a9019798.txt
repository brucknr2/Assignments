Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Research on the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans ranges from such               
              global problems as the functioning of an entire nervous system                 
              and the evolution of form to the molecular bases of the gene                   
              structure and function. C.l elegans has becomes an important                   
              experimental organism for the study of many aspects of animal                  
              biology, particularly the genetic and molecular bases of                       
              development and behavior. Dr. Anderson is requesting funds to                  
              help support two C. elegans meetings to be held at the university              
              of Wisconsin at Madison, WI in June of 1991 and 1993. Previous C.              
              elegans meeting shave led to the exchange of knowledge, methods,               
              mutants, and clones and have been vital in establishing the sense              
              of excitement and collegiality that characterizes this field.
