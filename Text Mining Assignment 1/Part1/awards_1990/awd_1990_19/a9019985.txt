Abstract    :
              A number of models exist for the neotectonics involved with a                  
              ridge-trench-trench triple junction, however, these are difficult              
              to test, partly due to a scarcity of suitable modern examples.                 
              This project will focus on differential uplift associated with the             
              subduction of an active spreading ridge in the Solomon Islands                 
              where the ridge axis is oblique to the trench.  Uplifted and                   
              deformed Late Pleistocene coral reefs will provide critical age                
              information and elevation relative to sea level data required to               
              reconstruct the uplift history in the vicinity of the ridge                    
              subduction.  Results are expected to provide patterns and rates of             
              uplift that can be applied to less well-exposed and more ancient               
              examples of ridge-ridge-trench systems.
