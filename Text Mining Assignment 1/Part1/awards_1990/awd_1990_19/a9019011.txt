Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will study the kinetics and mechanism               
              of aqueous oxidation of the minerals pyrrhotite and troilite under             
              a variety of geological conditions.  Principal techniques to be                
              employed are Mossbauer spectroscopy and chemical analysis for                  
              dissolved ionic iron and sulfur.  A variety of surface-sensitive               
              spectroscopic techniques also will be utilized to detect transient             
              species on mineral surfaces and to in turn help determine reaction             
              mechanism.  This research  will lead to a better understanding by              
              geologists of the rates of formation of seafloor iron ochre                    
              deposits from marine sulfide-bearing assemblages and of gossans                
              above ore deposits.
