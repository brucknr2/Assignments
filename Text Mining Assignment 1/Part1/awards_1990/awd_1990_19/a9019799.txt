Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Faults in convergent margin environments appear to be important                
              conduits for the expulsion of fluids during sediment compaction.               
              This process is important in controlling the alteration and                    
              physical properties of the sediment, and may be significant in                 
              determining the nature folding and deformation of sediment                     
              sequences. Little is known, however, about the permeability of                 
              sediments along and across individual fault zones. It is this                  
              permeability structure that ultimately controls fluid movement.                
                                                                                             
              The present project will examine variations in permeability                    
              before and after displacement along a fault. Specifically the                  
              project will use experimental and theoretical techniques to                    
              examine the change in hydrogeological properties of mud rich                   
              sediments in response to deformation and will evaluate the                     
              consequences this has for the dynamics of accreting sedimentary                
              wedges. The principal investigator has a distinguished record in               
              studies of these processes in the field. The present project will              
              extend his work to the laboratory.
