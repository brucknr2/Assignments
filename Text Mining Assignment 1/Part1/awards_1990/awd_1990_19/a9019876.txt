Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project supports the dissertation research of a cultural                  
              anthropologist studying the effects of growing up together on                  
              marital preferences.  The project tests the "Westermarck                       
              hypothesis", that intimate interaction in early childhood                      
              ("cosocialization") leads to sexual indifference in adulthood.                 
              The study will take place in Morocco, where the custom of                      
              marriage with the father's brother's son can provide evidence                  
              to test the hypothesis.  Psychological distances with regard to                
              marital attraction will be estimated between interviewees, who                 
              will be adolescent males and  females, and stimulus subjects, who              
              will be a list of potential marriage partners.  Cosocialized                   
              persons will be compared with non-cosocialized persons, holding                
              constant the influences of  other variables such as wealth,                    
              physical attractiveness and present social proximity.                          
                                                                                             
              This research is important because understanding the nature of                 
              sexual attraction and childhood cosocialization helps to explain               
              the function of the social life of families as well as shed light              
              on inbreeding avoidance responses.
