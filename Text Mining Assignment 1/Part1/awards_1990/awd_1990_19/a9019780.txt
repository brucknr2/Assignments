Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The objective of this research is to determine the cellular,                   
              physiological, and biophysical basis for gigantothermy in the                  
              leatherback sea turtle.  The following hypotheses will be tested:              
              1. The tissue metabolic rate of leatherback muscle is elevated                 
              above that of green turtles and intermediate between that of green             
              turtles and mammals.  2. Aerobic metabolism is the primary source              
              of energy for activity of nesting, and other exercise.  3.                     
              Leatherbacks maintain constant elevated body temperatures while                
              active and at rest in both warm (tropical) and cold (north                     
              temperate) waters.  4. Blood flow to the skin and periphery is                 
              increased when on land, and while exercising in warm (tropical)                
              waters, and reduced when in cold (north temperate) water.                      
                                                                                             
              These hypotheses will be tested by completing the following                    
              experiments: 1. Measure the tissue metabolic rate of the pectoral              
              muscles of leatherbacks and green turtles at temperatures from 5               
              to 35oC using a Gilson respirometer. 2. Measure the aerobic and                
              anaerobic metabolic rates of adult leatherbacks while they are                 
              resting and active on land in the tropics and north temperate                  
              region. 3. Use multichannel sonic transmitters to measure the body             
              temperature of resting and active turtles in warm and cold waters.             
              4. Measure skin blood flow using the 133xenon washout technique.               
              Finally these data will be used to test a mathematical model that              
              predicts the effects of body size and metabolic rate on heat                   
              transfer and body temperatures of leatherbacks on land and in the              
              water.//
