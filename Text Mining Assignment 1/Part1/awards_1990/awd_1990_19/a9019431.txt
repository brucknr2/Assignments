Abstract    :
                   High powered radio waves directed to the upper atmosphere                 
              and ionosphere can produce changes in composition, electron                    
              density, optical emissions and other radio waves at various                    
              frequencies.  The cause of many of these effects is still unknown              
              and just what perturbation will occur for a given power and                    
              frequency input is still theoretically unexplained.  This project              
              is to design a one dimensional model of the propagation of                     
              powerful radio waves in the lower ionosphere and compare this                  
              model to new experimental observations.  An approach based on                  
              kinetic theory will be used to discuss propagation of a single                 
              pulse , a series of pulses as well as a continuous wave.                       
              Calculations will be provided for varying parameters of the radio              
              wave such as effective power, frequency, polarization, duration                
              of the pulse and time between pulses.  These calculations will be              
              done for both daytime and nighttime ionospheric conditions.
