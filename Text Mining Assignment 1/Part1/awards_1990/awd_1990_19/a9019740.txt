Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will support the dissertation research of a cultural                
              anthropologist from the University of Texas.  The project                      
              involves the negotiation of social identity through the strategic              
              use of language among Arabs and Jews in Haifa, Israel.  The                    
              project will investigate how social groups form and transform                  
              their identities in everyday interaction through the strategic                 
              manipulation of language.  Objectives include collection of a                  
              representative sample of speech recorded in natural settings;                  
              eliciting the pragmatic meaning associated with variation in such              
              speech; and analyzing the power relations being negotiated in                  
              such interactions.  Results will contribute to social and                      
              linguistic theory and will address practical issues of achieving               
              harmonious social relations in Israel.
