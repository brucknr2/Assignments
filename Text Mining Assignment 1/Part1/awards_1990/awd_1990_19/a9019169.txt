Abstract    :
                   This award provides 40% funding for the acquisition of a                  
              computer system to be installed in the Institute of Tectonics at               
              the University of California, Santa Cruz. The University is                    
              committed to providing the remaining funds needed.                             
                   The computer system will be used primarily by the reflection              
              seismology group at the Institute of Tectonics. Examples of                    
              applications in the research projects of the group include the                 
              development and implementation of enhanced seismic imaging                     
              algorithms, the processing and interpretation of regional and                  
              continental scale data produced by portable seismograph array field            
              experiments, and the mapping of lithosphere structures.
