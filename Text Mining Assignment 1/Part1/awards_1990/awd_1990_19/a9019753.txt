Abstract    :
                   This research is primarily concerned with the                             
              investigation of astrophysical situations in which strong                      
              gravitational fields play an interesting role.  The                            
              oscillations and stability of rapidly rotating neutron stars                   
              will be investigated.  Of primary interest here are the                        
              secular instabilities that are moderated by the dissipative                    
              effects of viscosity and gravitational-radiation reaction.                     
              Investigations will also be made into the problem of                           
              formulating a relativistic theory of dissipative fluids.  The                  
              causality of the overall theory and the structure and                          
              stability of the equilibrium states are of fundamental                         
              interest.  The attempts to understand completely the                           
              symmetries of equilibrium stellar models in general relativity                 
              theory will continue (e.g., "Are all static stars                              
              spherical?").  Finally, the effects of superfluidity on the                    
              oscillations and stability of rotating neutron stars will be                   
              evaluated.  The influence of the complicated dynamics of a                     
              charge superfluid mixture on the macroscopic oscillations and                  
              the damping of these oscillation by viscous effects are of                     
              particular interest.
