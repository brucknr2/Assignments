Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Receptors are proteins which act as signal transducers in living               
              organisms.  A variety of neurotransmitters and hormones can                    
              regulate the activity of a wide range of functions such as                     
              maintaining blood pressure and heart rate, learning and memory or              
              vision.  A desired response depends on a specific receptor type.               
              Therefore, knowledge of the three dimensional structure of                     
              receptor molecules will lead to an understanding of what                       
              determines specificity and how the neurotransmitter or hormone is              
              translated by a cell to produce a desired response.                            
              Adrenergic receptors translate messages from a group of                        
              neurotransmitter and hormones called catecholamines.  It has been              
              demonstrated that, by using techniques of genetic engineering,                 
              one can make small changes in the receptor protein.  This new                  
              "engineered" receptor can now response to the slightly different               
              catecholester rather than the catecholamine.  In this way one                  
              can learn what are the critical "recognition sites" on the                     
              receptor and, eventually, what distinguishes the adrenergic                    
              receptor from other receptors.                                                 
                                                                                             
              This research takes advantage of the fact that the beta-                       
              adrenergic receptor (b-AR) is similar in structure to rhodopsin                
              which is the light-sensitive protein in the eye.  Again, by using              
              genetic engineering, one can alter the b-AR to respond in a way                
              similar to the light-sensitive receptor.  Therefore, light                     
              sensitive probes can be used to analyze the structure of the b-                
              AR.  This is a simpler and more effective method of studying the               
              structure of receptors.  These techniques will provide a better                
              means of studying fundamental biological processes and the                     
              molecular basis of disease.
