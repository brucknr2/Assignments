Abstract    :
                      During 1991, the Bureau of the Census will conduct the fifth           
              National Survey of Natural and Social Scientists and Engineers.                
              This survey series collects information on the demographic,                    
              educational, and employment characteristics of experienced                     
              scientists and engineers.  The initial survey was conducted in                 
              1982 and was based on a sample of respondents to the 1980                      
              Decennial Census who reported occupations in science and                       
              engineering.                                                                   
                      The National Science Foundation is the principal agency in             
              the Federal Government for data on the U.S. population of                      
              scientists and engineers.  The Scientific and Technical Personnel              
              Data System (STPDS), maintained in the Division of Science                     
              Resources Studies, is the primary means for collection of this                 
              information.  In addition to the National Survey of Natural and                
              Social Scientists and Engineers, the STPDS comprises the biennial              
              Survey of Recent Science and Engineering Graduates, the biennial               
              Survey of Doctorate Recipients, and the Science and Engineering                
              Tabulating Model, a computer model used to integrate survey                    
              results.
