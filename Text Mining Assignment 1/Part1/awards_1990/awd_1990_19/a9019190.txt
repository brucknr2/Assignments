Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will develop a new stable isotope mass              
              spectrometer capable of measuring oxygen isotope ratios of very                
              small samples.  An on-line capability for analyzing tiny silicate              
              and oxide mineral samples, using a new laser fluorination                      
              technique, also will be developed.  The latter will lead to a                  
              study of detailed exchange behavior of aqueous fluids with                     
              minerals and volcanic glasses.  Additionally, studies will be                  
              conducted on isotopic variations in several specific rift-zone                 
              environments where enhanced fracture permeability allows deep                  
              circulation of surface waters.  Investigations also will take                  
              place to better understand the isotope geochemistry of the                     
              continental crust and upper mantle.
