              Description:  This project supports participation by 16                        
              U.S. scientists in the International Symposium on                              
              Intelligent Robotics, planned for January 3-5, 1991 in                         
              Bangalore, India.  The meeting will include the following                      
              areas: robot control, kinematics and dynamics, grasping,                       
              vision, sensing, sensor fusion, distributed processing,                        
              neural networks, task planning, mobile robots, unmanned                        
              vehicles, architecture for intelligent robots, robot                           
              programming languages, computational algebra and geometry,                     
              and applications of intelligent robots.  Several plennary                      
              sessions are planned, in addition to concurrent sessions                       
              for contributed and invited papers.                                            
                                                                                             
              Scope:  The meeting is sponsored by the Centre for                             
              Artificial Intelligence & Robotics of the Government of                        
              India, in cooperation with the Institute of Electrical and                     
              Electronic Engineers (IEEE), the Automation and Systems,                       
              Man and Cybernetics Societies, and the International                           
              Federation of Automatic Control.  Speakers and participants                    
              are expected from Japan, several European countries,                           
              Canada, Singapore in addition to the U.S. and India.  It is                    
              highly likely that the exchange of information will be                         
              useful to the U.S. and Indian scientists and that future                       
              cooperative research will result.
