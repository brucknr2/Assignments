Abstract    :
              The influence of preferential diffusion of reactant species on                 
              the propagation of a flame through a turbulent gaseous                         
              fuel/oxidizer mixture is to be studied by a series of                          
              experiments in a constant volume, fan-stirred combustion                       
              chamber.  The velocity field and turbulence quantities will be                 
              measured using two-point laser velocimetry and particle-image                  
              velocimetry, and laser flame tomography will be used to                        
              determine the instantaneous flame surface.                                     
              Hydrogen/oxygen/nitrogen mixtures producing preferential                       
              diffusion with a stabilizing influence on the flame structure                  
              will be chosen to cover a wide range of laminar flame speeds,                  
              and the turbulence intensity and integral scale of the                         
              reactants will be  controlled independently.  The test range                   
              will involve the thin laminar flamelet regime for turbulent                    
              Reynolds numbers up to 10,000.  The flame propagation process                  
              will be simulated theoretically using statistical time-series                  
              techniques as a way to interpret the measurements, and as a                    
              way to initiate the development of a computationally tractable                 
              predictive tool which includes a rational treatment of the                     
              flow physics.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              Understanding the interaction between turbulence and the speed                 
              with which a flame propagates into a combustible mixture is a                  
              fundamental issue in combustion science.  The results of this                  
              research will provide insight into one aspect of this complex                  
              phenomena, with applications possible to internal combustion                   
              engines and turbulent premixed combustion processes in                         
              general.
