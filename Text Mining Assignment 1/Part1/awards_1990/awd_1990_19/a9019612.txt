Abstract    :
              This project is funded by two awards:  CTS 90-17692 to Purdue                  
              University and CTS 90-19612 to the Pennsylvania State                          
              University.  It is a study of the correlations between                         
              crystallite size, electrical properties, and catalytic                         
              behavior of highly dispersed silver particles on alumina or                    
              silica with particle diameters of 1 to 30 nm.  Experiments                     
              performed include solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance of                    
              adsorbed species containing carbon-13 on clean silver and on                   
              silver covered with oxygen-16 or oxygen-17; conduction                         
              electron spin resonance of the conduction electrons of small                   
              (less than 5 nm) silver crystallites; and isotopic transient                   
              kinetic studies of the  partial oxidation of ethylene (to                      
              ethylene oxide) over silver.  Previous studies have shown that                 
              well-dispersed, silica-supported silver catalysts do not                       
              sinter during partial oxidation; these catalysts also exhibit                  
              selectivities comparable to poorly dispersed silver/alpha-                     
              alumina catalysts, but at much lower promoter (dichloroethane)                 
              concentrations.  The detailed mechanism of ethylene oxide                      
              formation on silver is not known, but subsurface oxygen has                    
              been shown to be present and dynamically coupled to the                        
              reaction.  This study examines these phenomena under a series                  
              of controlled conditions.                                                      
                                                                                             
              The expoxidation of ethylene is a worldwide, very competitive,                 
              multibillion-dollar business; even modest improvements in                      
              process efficiency can have major impact on competitive                        
              position.  This work addresses this issue directly, and also                   
              has implications for other processes.
