Abstract    :
              Many eukaryotic genes are interrupted by intervening sequences                 
              which are excised from mRNA precursors (pre-mRNAs) during pre mRNA             
              splicing.  The long-term objective of our research is to understand            
              how pre-mRNA splice sites are accurately and efficiently                       
              recognized, cleaved and ligated during splicing.  Recognition and              
              cleavage of 5' splice sites is mediated by U1 small nuclear                    
              ribonucleoprotein, a sub-assembly of the spliceosome.  The approach            
              has been to first characterize the structure and function of U1                
              snRNP and have shown that the U1 snRNP-specific U1-70K and U1-A                
              proteins are sequence-specific RNA-binding protein.  Elucidating               
              the functions of the various components of U1 snRNP during pre-mRNA            
              splicing is being planned.  This will involve extending the studies            
              of U1 snRNP structure, determining the mechanism(s) of sequence-               
              specific RNA-binding by the U1-70K and U1-A proteins, and defining             
              the properties of various components of U1 snRNP.  As members of               
              the RNP sequence domain class of RNA-binding proteins, the U1-70K,             
              U1-A, and U2-B" proteins will also be used as models to study this             
              class of sequence-specific RNA-protein interactions.  The functions            
              of these snRNP proteins during pre-mRNA splicing may be modulated,             
              through regulation of the biosynthesis of the human U1-70K snRNP               
              protein, via alternative splicing of its own pre-mRNA will be                  
              studied.
