Abstract    :
              The interpretation of light emitted by atmospheric atoms and                   
              molecules provides an important means for understanding the                    
              behavior of the atmosphere.  The accuracy of the interpretation                
              depends upon the accuracy of basic knowledge of the detailed                   
              behavior of the atoms and molecules involved.  This grant aims                 
              at providing new and better basic data for interactions important              
              in atmospheric research.  A scattering theoretical formulation of              
              molecular spectroscopy is used to interpret spectroscopic data                 
              and to construct a potential matrix that reproduces the                        
              observations.  The matrix is then used to make reliable                        
              predictions of the cross sections and rate coefficients of                     
              molecular processes that are important in the upper atmosphere.                
              Examples where spectroscopic data exist are molecular oxygen,                  
              nitric oxide, the hydroxyl radical and its parent ion.                         
              Calculations will be carried out of the quenching of metastable                
              oxygen and nitrogen atoms in collisions with oxygen atoms.  The                
              radiative association of oxygen atoms will also be investigated                
              and the emission spectrum obtained.  The quenching of metastable               
              oxygen ions and the excitation of metastable oxygen by proton                  
              impact will be explored.
