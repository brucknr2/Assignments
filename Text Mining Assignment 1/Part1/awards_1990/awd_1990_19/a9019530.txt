Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal concerns two aspects of protein folding and                      
              stability: the nature of partially-folded species, especially                  
              the molten globule state, and the factors which determine a                    
              particular folding pathway.  The long-term goals are to learn                  
              how the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide guides the folding                
              to the native state, and determines the stability of protein                   
              conformations.  A relatively compact protein conformational                    
              state, often referred to as the molten globule state, has been                 
              shown to be an intermediate in the refolding of certain                        
              proteins, and to be stable under certain denaturation                          
              conditions for some proteins.  One of the goals of this                        
              research is to increase the understanding about the molecular                  
              details and physical properties of molten globules.  The molten                
              globule state will be studied under both equilibrium and                       
              transient refolding conditions.  In addition the pathway of                    
              folding will be mapped out by using specific signals from                      
              different regions of the molecule in stopped-flow kinetics                     
              experiments at both ambient and subzero temperatures.  A                       
              variety of biophysical techniques will be used to structurally                 
              characterize the molten globule state from several different                   
              proteins (in order to establish generalities); these include                   
              FTIR, circular dichroism (CD), fluorescence and hydrodynamic                   
              radius measurements.  In addition kinetic experiments using                    
              stopped-flow fluorescence and CD will be performed.
