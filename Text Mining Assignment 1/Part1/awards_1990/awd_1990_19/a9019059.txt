Abstract    :
              The influence of human activities on Antarctic ecosystems is an                
              important issue in this pristine and fragile environment.  In                  
              particular, the release of untreated sewage from McMurdo Station               
              has drawn considerable attention from envirnomental groups.  At the            
              same time, very little is known about the persistence of enteric               
              indicator and pathogenic bacteria in the Antarctic marine                      
              environment.  McFeters proposes to address key questions that                  
              relate to the potential public health and environmental impact of              
              releasing untreated sewage into Antarctic sea water.  Moreover, it             
              is hypothesized that the sewage plume does not extend to the area              
              of the potable water intake for McMurdo Station.  This hypothesis              
              remains untested in view of the extended  persistence of enteric               
              bacteria and currents in McMurdo Sound.  McFeters will describe the            
              extent of the sewage plume under maximal occupancy circumstances               
              at McMurdo Station and the potential health as well as                         
              environmental consequences of the present sewage disposal                      
              practices.  Such information will be applicable to other polar                 
              regions where increasing human activity poses a threat to the local            
              ecosystem.
