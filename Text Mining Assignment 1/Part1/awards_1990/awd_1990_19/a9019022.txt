Abstract    :
                   Forearc deposits are commonly deformed soon after they are                
              formed due to continuing convergence between plates, however, the              
              style of deformation may vary depending on convergence angles and              
              rates.  Also most modern forearcs are largely submarine and are                
              difficult to study.  This project will focus on deformation of a               
              Pliocene and Pleistocene forearc exposed on the east coast of North            
              Island, New Zealand, an area experiencing active deformation and               
              seismicity resulting from oblique convergence between the Pacific              
              and Australian plates.  The project will involve detailed geologic             
              mapping, strain analysis of fault sets and investigation of                    
              Holocene fault and fold deformation in a region having a gradation             
              of convergence angles.  Results will increase understanding of both            
              the structure and tectonic evolution of the area and will document             
              strain partitioning in obliquely convergent margins.  It will also             
              provide information on possible changes in strain caused by                    
              increasing obliquity of convergence.  Such information will be                 
              applicable in other modern examples of forearc deformation and in              
              interpreting ancient forearc situations.
