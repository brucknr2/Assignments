Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will create a high field ultra-long pulse magnet                  
              laboratory.  The laboratory expects to operate nondestructive                  
              magnets in the 60-70 Tesla range with a "flat top" time at maximum             
              field of more than 0.5 second.  This doubles the field strength                
              presently available in DC magnets, in a pulsed system with a                   
              duration of sufficient length that traditional experiments can be              
              performed in a straightforward manner and metallic samples have                
              time to thermally relax from eddy current heating.  The magnets                
              will serve the ongoing research programs of the three principal                
              investigators in High Tc superconductors, Quantum Hall devices, and            
              low dimensional organic conductors, and will be available to                   
              industrial collaborators, and other users as well.  The magnets                
              will have a strong impact on materials science, electronics, and               
              many new technologies as well as on the future development of                  
              higher field magnets.  The high stored energy source at the                    
              Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (200 MW, 400 MJ in a flywheel              
              generator set) will be made available for this project.
