Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This is a proposal to continue and extend work in progress                
              on the systematics of salamanders from the western United States               
              and from Middle America.  The main emphasis of the study is the                
              morphology and genetic variation of the species.  The main                     
              morphological topic is the development and comparative structure               
              of the brains of salamanders that use extreme fast and far-                    
              reaching tongues to capture prey.  Comparative anatomical studies              
              of other parts of the organism will also be conducted.  Both                   
              protein and nucleic acid variation will be studied in a number of              
              species.  A long range goal of this study is to determine how                  
              many species of salamanders there are in these regions, and to                 
              determine the patterns of phylogenetic relationships among them,               
              as they are important to our understanding of ecology and earth                
              history.
