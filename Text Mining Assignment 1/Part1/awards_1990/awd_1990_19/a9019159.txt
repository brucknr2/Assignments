Abstract    :
              Mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana which are defective in the repair              
              of DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light will be isolated.                   
              Genetic analysis will be used to elucidate the molecular mechanism             
              of the various pathways required for reversal or repair of damage              
              to DNA and determine which of the repair pathways are involved.                
              Mutants defective in recombination can be expected to also be                  
              isolated since many basic cellular mechanisms also utilize the                 
              repair pathways. After mutant characterization, strategies for                 
              cloning the involved genes will be pursued.                                    
                                                                                             
              The availability of DNA repair mutants of this model organism will             
              enhance studies of this important area of research in plants.***
