Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The research planned is to analyze specific representative enzymes             
              in the daunomycin biosynthetic pathway to determine their substrate            
              specificity, kinetics, and regulation as part of an assessment of              
              possible differential regulation of the first one-half of the                  
              pathway in relation to the second one-half; such differential                  
              regulation may account for the failure of biosynthetic                         
              intermediates to be converted to the end-product antibiotic and,               
              instead, to accumulate in cells.  Molecular biological and genetic             
              approaches will be employed to determine transcriptional and                   
              translational regulation of each enzyme in the pathway that has                
              been purified, kinetics, etc., determined, so as to enlarge our                
              understanding of the physiological and molecular genetic aspects               
              of the regulation of the synthesis of this antibiotic, a product               
              of secondary metabolite syntheses.                                             
                                                                                             
              Antibiotic synthesis and excretion is a characteristic of many                 
              bacteria and fungi and is a product of their "secondary                        
              metabolism"; the regulation of this type of metabolism is even less            
              well understood than is central metabolism, and this project is                
              directed at elucidating regulatory aspects of the secondary                    
              metabolism of a bacterium producing the antibiotic, daunomycin;                
              this antibiotic's precursors accumulate in the producing cells                 
              rather than being converted entirely into the antibiotic;                      
              understanding what is responsible for this inefficiency may permit             
              developments to improve the conversion and increase effectiveness              
              of antibiotic production.
