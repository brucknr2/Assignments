Abstract    :
              The instrumentation to be developed consists of a custom-designed              
              16-channel analog very-large-scale integrated (VLSI) circuit chip,             
              an improved 64-lead multiple-microelectrode plate (MMEP) assembly,             
              and the necessary circuit boards and controller units to                       
              incorporate four of the 16-channel chips for the sensing and                   
              stimulation of action potentials in cultured neuronal networks.                
              This instrumentation will be used in the determination of basic                
              neuronal network organization and function through the analysis of             
              stimulated and unstimulated network output.
