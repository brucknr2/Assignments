Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic                  
              program is made to Dr. Terrence J. Collins in the Chemistry                    
              Department of Carnegie Mellon University to continue work on                   
              coordination complexes containing transition metals in high                    
              oxidation states.  Collins has developed macroamide ligands                    
              which are not susceptible to oxidation and can be used to                      
              maintain Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni in unusual high oxidation states.                  
              Synthesis of additional compounds of this type will be                         
              attempted.  Depending on the metal and structure of the                        
              respective compound, it may serve as a model for methane                       
              monooxygenase, as an electrocatalyst or chemical sensor, a                     
              catalytic O-atom transfer agent, or exhibit antiferromagnetic                  
              coupling at low temperatures.  The compounds will be                           
              characterized using a variety of techniques, including electron                
              paramagnetic resonance and Mossbauer spectroscopies, and cyclic                
              voltammetry.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              The investigation will focus on four square-planar complexes of                
              Mn(V) that are known, as well as 5- and 6-coordinate systems.                  
              Synthesis of nitrido analogs of some known manganese and iron                  
              compounds will be attempted.  Oxygen atom transfer reactions of                
              Fe(IV), Ni(III), and Co(III) will also be investigated. The                    
              reaction chemistry of a stable Fe(IV)-O-Fe(IV) species, which                  
              is known to undergo three reversible oxidations, will be                       
              explored in detail. A detailed magnetic study will be                          
              undertaken of a linear polymer of antiferromagnetically coupled                
              S=2 Mn(III) centers that shows unusual ferromagnetic                           
              interactions at low temperatures.
