Abstract    :
              This project will continue development of techniques to extract                
              better information about the kinematics of mid-ocean ridge                     
              spreading center evolution from seafloor lineation data.  The                  
              project will address the difficults that marine magnetic data are              
              limited in their resolution. The technique to be developed here                
              will use as many lineated structures as possible near the spreading            
              center.  Synthetic fabric is then generated for the entire region,             
              assuming that the lineations reflect isochrons, and the fit between            
              the data and models is numerically measured to provide an objective            
              estimate of the fit.
