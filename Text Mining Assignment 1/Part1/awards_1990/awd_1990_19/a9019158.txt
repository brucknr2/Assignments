Abstract    :
              Systematic studies of perennial species of Helianthus will follow              
              two major lines of research.  One is to use data from analysis of              
              chloroplast DNA restriction site mutations to clarify several                  
              phylogenetic problems.  These include the relationship of                      
              Helianthus to the putatively related genus, Phoebanthus, the                   
              relationships among the infrageneric groups of Helianthus (sects.              
              Helianthus, Ciliares, and Atrorubentes), and the relationships of              
              two enigmatic species, H. porteri and H. agrestis.  A second major             
              line of research will be to use data from chemistry, chloroplast               
              DNA and nuclear ribosomal DNA restriction site analysis and                    
              isozymes to clarify selected situations that involve hybridization             
              or polyploidy in species of the genus that occur in the                        
              southeastern United States.  The results of the project will be to             
              provide a firm phylogeny for Helianthus as a basis to understand               
              topics such as biogeography and chemical evolution in the genus,               
              and to clarify the systematics of the genus in the southeastern                
              United States.
