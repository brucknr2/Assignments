Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This project will deploy an array of 14 three-component ocean-            
              bottom seismometers to record earthquakes for a period of about                
              eight weeks at two sites along the northern Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The            
              objectives are to: (1) locate the hypocenters of earthquakes within            
              the median valley; (2) conduct source mechanism studies of located             
              earthquakes; (3) invert P and S wave travel time and attenuation               
              differences; and (4) define the relationships among earthquakes                
              locations and source characteristics, and structural heterogeneity             
              to segment length, median valley width, axial topographic relief               
              and mantle Bouguer anomaly.
