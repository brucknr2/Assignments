Abstract    :
              The principal investigators will study minerals and mineral                    
              stabilities in the chemical system iron oxide-titanium oxide-                  
              alumina-silica-water.  In particular, the thermochemical and mixing            
              properties of Fe-staurolite, the stability of Fe-cordierite, and               
              the hematite-ilmenite solvus will be investigated.  The staurolite             
              and cordierite results should yield geothermobarometers useful in              
              the study of pelitic rock metamorphism.  The hematite-ilmenite work            
              will allow estimates of oxygen fugacity and hence water fraction               
              of fluids in graphitic pelites.  It may also allow estimation of               
              oxygen fugacity for rocks in which hemoilmenite occurs.  Overall,              
              this research will allow geologists to better estimate the                     
              conditions to which aluminous rocks have been subjected during                 
              metamorphism.
