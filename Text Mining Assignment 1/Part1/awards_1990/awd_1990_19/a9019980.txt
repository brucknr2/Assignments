Abstract    :
                   Funds are provided to purchase hardware and software to                   
              enhance the capabilities of the UNIDATA system at Millersville                 
              University of Pennsylvania.  The UNIDATA program is a national                 
              program to help universities use computing and communication                   
              technologies to access, display and analyze scientific data.                   
              The suite of software developed by UNIDATA is capable of running               
              on, and across, multiply hardware platforms.  Millersville has                 
              been an active and creative participant in the UNIDATA  program                
              for several years.  To further enhance their capabilities                      
              Millersville will acquire a workstation and local area network                 
              (LAN) hardware and software.  The LAN will allow the existing PC-              
              McIDAS systems (a PC-based program in the UNIDATA suite of                     
              software) to interface with another UNIDATA software system, the               
              Scientific Data Management/Local Data Management software.  The                
              acquisition of this equipment is part of the Department of Earth               
              Sciences' strategic plan to continue and strengthen its                        
              participation in the UNIDATA Program; to greatly expand the use                
              of PC-McIDAS with real-time data in the classroom; and to support              
              and develop research opportunities.  The equipment will operate                
              as both an additional workstation and an ingester/manager and                  
              file server for the present OS/2-based PC-McIDAS systems.
