Abstract    :
                   Dr. Pieper, and his collaborator Dr. Holliday, will                       
              undertake a two-year program to develop the new instrumentation                
              that will allow the ocean science community to test hypotheses                 
              about how changes in physical oceanographic parameters at a                    
              variety of spatial and temporal scales will result in                          
              complementary changes in the composition and abundance of                      
              zooplankton and micronekton communities.  This research will be                
              part of the Global Ocean Ecosystems Dynamics program of the US                 
              Global CHange Program.  These investigators will develop arrays                
              for six moorings which will include current meters, thermistors,               
              and several kinds of sensors designed to acoustically estimate                 
              zooplankton and micronekton biomass and size at one-half hour                  
              intervals.  These systems will include automated data acquisition              
              and real-time telemetry to facilitate analysis and provide                     
              opportunities for opportunistic sampling of transient events.
