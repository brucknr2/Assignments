Abstract    :
                   Organisms can become resistant to new diseases or utilize a               
              new food source as a result of diversity in their genetic                      
              material which serves as raw material for the evolutionary                     
              process.  Many mechanisms exist to increase or decrease the                    
              amounts of genetic diversity.  Inbreeding, a mating system where               
              closely related individuals mate to produce offspring, can reduce              
              genetic variation in natural populations by increasing the                     
              probability that genes are identical by descent.  In plants,                   
              inbreeding can lead to short-lived plants and reduced crop yields              
              when the identical genes are lethal genes.  As a  result, some                 
              plants have evolved a self-incompatibility mechanism that                      
              prevents self-fertilization and the harmful effects of                         
              inbreeding.                                                                    
                   In many species of plants, the self-incompatibility function              
              is encoded by a single gene.  The self-incompatibility gene can                
              not only increase genetic variation at the locus that encodes it               
              but may also increase diversity of genes located nearby.  The                  
              main objective of this research is to study variation of                       
              nucleotide sequences of the self-incompatibility locus of Solanum              
              carolinense, the horse nettle, in order to determine the impact                
              that the self-incompatibility mechanism has on this unique                     
              genetic locus and on nearby nucleotide sites.
