Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This program will focus on a petrological and geochemical                 
              characterization of the intra-transform spreading centers in                   
              the Siqueiros transform fault, on determining the structural                   
              histroy along the transform domain through ALVIN field mapping,                
              structural studies of deformed rocks recovered from the walls                  
              of each fault scarp, and on understanding the tectonci                         
              processess that have influenced the development of the                         
              Siqueiros tranform for the past 4 Ma. There will be eighteen                   
              ALVIN dives in the transfrom and a night-time program of rock                  
              coring and dredging that will provide additional samples from                  
              along the spreading axis and at various sites along the strike-                
              slip faults. SeaBeam will be used at night to produce detailed                 
              10 m contour maps of each spreading axis. Questions to be                      
              addressed include: What processes are responsible for                          
              initiating intra-transform spreading? What is the evolutionary                 
              sequence of lava types erupted when a new spreading center                     
              start? What is the nature of major transform-affiliated                        
              compositional discontinuities in the mantle? What is the scale                 
              of chemical heterogeneity in the mantle? Are unique magma types                
              generated along transform faults?
