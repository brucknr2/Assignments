Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary objective of this U.S.-Czechoslovakia                              
              research project between Dr. Rama Bansil of Boston                             
              University and Dr. Cestmir Konak of the Czechoslovak                           
              Institute of Macromolecular Chemistry is to study the                          
              kinetics of gelation and the diffusion of particles and                        
              polymers in gels.                                                              
                                                                                             
              To do this the researchers will add a very small                               
              concentration of colloidal particles or a probe polymer                        
              which scatters light to a polymer solution.  Measurements                      
              of subsequent diffusion will be made using static and                          
              dynamic laser light scattering.  The experimental                              
              results will be analyzed through computer simulations to                       
              determine the details of the dynamic process.  Results                         
              are expected to contribute to our basic understanding of                       
              electrophoresis and polymer diffusion in random media.                         
                                                                                             
              This project in polymer research fulfills the program                          
              objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling                        
              leading experts in the United States and Eastern Europe                        
              to combine complementary talents and pool research                             
              resources in areas of strong mutual interest and                               
              competence.
