Abstract    :
                   Organisms face the common problems of avoiding death,                     
              harvesting and allocating finite resources to maintenance,                     
              reproduction, growth and storage.  It is the communalty of these               
              problems that provides the unifying basis for life history                     
              theories.  Many organisms begin life, reach maturity, reproduce                
              once and die in the same year.  In contrast, humans and some                   
              female turtles postpone sexual maturity for over 15 years,                     
              exhibit repeated reproduction over many years, and have maximum                
              life expectancies that approach 100 years.  Because of the                     
              logistical problems and the duration of study necessary,                       
              actuarial and complete life history data are almost completely                 
              lacking for most long lived organisms other than man.  The                     
              primary objective of the proposed research is to complete the                  
              documentation of life history traits of turtles on the University              
              of Michigan's, E. S. George Reserve in southeastern Michigan by                
              examining the relationships among age, body size, stored energy,               
              growth rates, clutch size (number of eggs) and clutch frequency                
              of individuals reproducing for the first time in their lives.                  
                   In conjunction with the previous studies of three species of              
              turtles on the E. S. George Reserve during 26 of the past 36                   
              years, data collected during the tenure of the proposed research               
              will allow tests of current theories of the evolution of delayed               
              sexual maturity, and provide a basis for understanding age                     
              specific aspects of the biology of long-lived organisms that is                
              critical for the conservation and management of such species.
