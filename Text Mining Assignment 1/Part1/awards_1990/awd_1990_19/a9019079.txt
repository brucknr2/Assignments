Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  An International Scientific Conference of Sociolegal                      
              Scholars is planned for June 25-29,  1991, in Amsterdam,                       
              Netherlands.  This event  is the first truly international                     
              scientific gathering in this field,  with roughly equal                        
              participation from the U.S. and Western Europe,  as well as                    
              participants from elsewhere in North and South America,                        
              Eastern Europe,  Asia,  Africa,  Australia,  Oceania,  and                     
              the Near East.                                                                 
                   The purpose of the conference is to strengthen                            
              collaborative comparative research across both national and                    
              disciplinary boundaries.  The grant is to provide support for                  
              travel by U.S. participants to the conference.  In the                         
              selection of awardees, the co-sponsors (the Law and Society                    
              Association and the International Sociological Association)                    
              have assigned first priority to younger scholars (both those                   
              who are about to receive their Ph.Ds. and those of have                        
              received them recently).                                                       
                   Most social scientific studies of law in the United                       
              States have focussed on "common law" institutions as they                      
              have evolved in this country.  The potential for advancing                     
              knowledge through comparative studies with other common law                    
              systems,  with civil law systems,  and with other forms is                     
              great.  Moreover,  with legal and social structures changing                   
              so markedly in many parts of the world,  the cross-cultural                    
              research,  stimulated by the conference, should take on an                     
              added timeliness and significance.
