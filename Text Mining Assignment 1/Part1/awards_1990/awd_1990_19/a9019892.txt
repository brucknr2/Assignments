Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The topic of this conference is various aspects of                        
              similarity solutions of differential equations (solutions                      
              obtained by the classical Lie group method or generalizations),                
              the occurrence of similarity solutions in applicable situations,               
              the study of similarity solutions of particular equations, and                 
              the relation of similarity solutions to more general solutions of              
              the relevant equations.  Subjects to be discussed include                      
              travelling waves for reaction-diffusion equations, blow-up and                 
              quenching problems, equations soluble by inverse scattering and                
              the Painleve transcendent equations, and boundary layer problems.              
                   This grant will help support a conference to be held at the               
              University of Pittsburgh on April 26-28, 1991, whose goals are to              
              provide a forum for the exchange of ideas and results on the                   
              leading edge of research in this topic.
