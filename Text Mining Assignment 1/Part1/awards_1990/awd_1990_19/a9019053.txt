Abstract    :
              The control of vertebrate muscle contraction is regulated by the               
              binding and unbinding of Ca2+ to the thin-filament protein                     
              troponin (Tn).  Upon Ca2+ binding, structural changes occur in the             
              thin filament which mediate the interaction of myosin and actin                
              in the presence of ATP.  Dr. Mendelson proposes to study these                 
              changes and also those that occur when myosin heads are bound to               
              the thin filament.  Neutron scattering and diffraction will be                 
              used to study filamentous samples in vitro.  Selective                         
              deuteration of one or more of the members of a complex will allow              
              either the protonated or deuterated member(s) to be rendered                   
              "invisible"  to neutrons by solvent contrast matching.                         
              Structural changes of the visible components can thus  be                      
              investigated in situ with little ambiguity.  The average cross-                
              helix distance between the tropomyosin (Tm) molecules and their                
              ordering in thin filaments will be investigated + Ca2 and with                 
              varying amounts of myosin subfragment-one present.  The average                
              intra-pair separation between Tn molecules will be studied +Ca2+.              
              Changes in the structure of F-actin in situ will also be                       
              investigated +Ca2+.  Phase information will be collected on the                
              thin filament with the aim of understanding the entire thin                    
              filament structure with and without Ca2+
