Abstract    :
              Professor Branka Ladanyi is supported by a grant from the                      
              Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to perform                     
              theoretical studies of solvent effects on chemical reactions.                  
              This research will help to provide a deeper theoretical                        
              understanding of the factors which influence and enhance                       
              chemical reactions in solution.                                                
                                                                                             
              Professor Ladanyi plans to use a combination of integral                       
              equation approaches and computer simulations to study solvent                  
              effects on the rates of chemical reactions.  The work will                     
              focus on three specific topics: 1) solvent effects on the                      
              activation barrier for torsional isomerization; 2) solvent                     
              effects on the transition state for bimolecular reactions of                   
              ions and/or polar molecules in polar solvent mixtures; and 3)                  
              dynamic solvation, i.e., the transient response of the solvent                 
              to a charge transfer electronic transition of a probe molecule.
