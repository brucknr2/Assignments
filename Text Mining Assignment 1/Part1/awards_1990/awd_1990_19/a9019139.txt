Abstract    :
              When DNA molecules of appropriate structures are injected into the             
              nuclei of Xenopus laevis oocytes, they are recombined very                     
              efficiently.  This process is completely dependent on sequence                 
              homology between the recombining DNAs and on those DNAs being                  
              linear.  Characterization of this process will be continued with               
              the goals of achieving a complete description of its molecular                 
              mechanism and of the activities that catalyze each step in the                 
              pathway.  The proposed approach has several facets:  construction              
              of substrates that test predictions of possible recombination                  
              mechanisms; isolation and characterization of recombination                    
              intermediates; and injection of putative intermediates to prove                
              that they are on the pathway to recombination products.                        
              Considerable effort will be directed at improving and exploiting               
              a recently developed cell-free oocyte nuclear extract that                     
              catalyzes complete recombination events.  Requirements for                     
              recombination in the extract will be examined as a means of                    
              determining the underlying biochemical processes.  Components of               
              the extract will be fractionated in an effort to purify enzymes                
              that catalyze individual steps in recombination.
