Abstract    :
                   This award supports the development of practical                          
              instruments, using the concepts of near-field scanning optical                 
              microscopy (NSOM), and utilizes these instruments for                          
              nanometrology applications.  The project will be carried out in                
              three phases.  In the first phase a near-field scanning optical                
              microscope using visible illumination will be designed, built,                 
              and tested.  In the second phase an instrument that works in the               
              infrared region will be developed.  The infrared instrument will               
              use most of the subsystems that have been previously tested in                 
              the visible domain.  The two devices will be characterized in the              
              final phase and applied to the measurement of selected                         
              engineering surfaces.
