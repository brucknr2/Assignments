Abstract    :
                   This project will review, evaluate, and analyze new and                   
              unprecedented sources of data on the education and utilization of              
              the Soviet science and engineering workforce.  Appropriate data                
              on Soviet scientists and engineers (S/E's) will be compiled and                
              comparisons will be made with similar data for the United States.              
              Major changes are occurring in the Soviet science and technology               
              infrastructure and data collection systems.  This project will                 
              examine some of these changes and their implications for inter-                
              preting overall S&E capabilities.  There are also major changes                
              occurring in the Soviet science and technology data collection                 
              systems.  This project will help to evaluate, analyze, and                     
              interpret changes in the data availability, definitions, and                   
              data collection systems.                                                       
                    This project is related to one of the eight areas targeted               
              for cooperative research under the Memorandum of Understanding                 
              between NSF and the USSR Academy of Sciences.  Science and                     
              engineering indicators is a high priority under the science                    
              policy area and information on the S&E workforce is a critical                 
              indicator of a country's S&E capability.  This project would help              
              NSF access and analyze the large amount of data now becoming                   
              available on S/E personnel, establish a baseline for such data,                
              and identify  critical information gaps.  The project is also                  
              related to the NSF goal of expanding its international database                
              of science and engineering indicators.
