Abstract    :
                   This grant supports research activities which will                        
              address a wide range of issues in nuclear physics.                             
              Measurements of the asymmetry in the beta-decay of mirror                      
              nuclei will test the Conserved Vector Current hypothesis.                      
              Other measurements of the beta-asymmetry/electro-polarization                  
              correlation will test aspects of the Standard Model for                        
              the weak interaction.  Intermediate energy electron scattering                 
              experiments will give information on the electric and magnetic                 
              form factors of the neutron, electromagnetic properties of                     
              3He, and may give evidence of color transparency in collisions                 
              with high momentum transfer.
