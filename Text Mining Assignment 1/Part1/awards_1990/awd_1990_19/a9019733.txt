Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Unresolved issues on the timing and magnitude of changes in                    
              deep ocean chemical composition and circulation can be tackled                 
              with selective paired measurements of benthic foraminiferal Cd,                
              &13C, and &180 in deep ocean sediment cores.  Gaps will be                     
              filled and benthic paleochemical coverage of the last glacial                  
              maximum, and cores from the South Atlantic, Antarctic, and                     
              Northwest Pacific will be examined to clarify why existing &13C                
              and Cd evidence suggest such different glacial paleochemical                   
              characteristics.  Two more long downcore Cd records will be                    
              completed to constrain the amplitude, timing, and spectral                     
              characteristic of benthic paleochemical changes.  This data                    
              will be examined from the perspective of simple models for                     
              carbon and nutrient cycling within the ocean, in order to                      
              assess the role of ocean chemistry and circulation in                          
              controlling atmospheric CO2.
