Abstract    :
                   Three faculty, two research associates and four graduate                  
              students will continue their research in elementary particle                   
              physics.  The university based effort uses facilities at                       
              Fermilab, one experiment at the Tevatron Collider (E740 at the                 
              D0 interaction region) and the second an experiment with                       
              neutrinos, in the final stage of completion.  The Collider                     
              experiment is a large collaborative effort to study proton-                    
              antiproton collisions at the highest energies available at                     
              accelerators.  The group has had responsibility for major                      
              subsystems of the detector, the fast trigger system, the                       
              implementation of the cosmic ray shield and the overall                        
              management of the test-beam program at Fermilab.  The collider                 
              experiment will explore the  high energy frontier of particle                  
              physics, an unknown arena at the limit of applicability of the                 
              current theory of particle physics.
