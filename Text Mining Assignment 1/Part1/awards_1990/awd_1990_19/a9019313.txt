Abstract    :
              This award is for the development of a specific NMR technology with            
              a long term objective to develop NMR spectroscopy as a powerful                
              tool for protein engineering and rational drug design.                         
              Specifically in this project, Dr. Montelione will develop software             
              for computer assisted analysis of MD (multi-dimensional) NMR                   
              spectra, and will develop pulsed field gradient technology for high            
              resolution NMR with a focus on applications of MD-NMR to the                   
              analysis of proteins in aqueous solution.  The PFG technology                  
              represents one of the most exciting frontiers of high field NMR                
              spectroscopy today.  If it is successfully developed, it will                  
              significantly advance our ability to analyze protein molecules that            
              are currently not amenable to NMR studies.
