Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will be seconded to the Secretariat of the          
              Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) to serve as IOC               
              Assistant Secretary for living resources and coastal oceanography.  This       
              secondment will cover a two-year period.  Dr. Osborn will assist the IOC       
              to develop more effective programs in biological and coastal                   
              oceanography and to assure effective interaction between these focussed        
              problems and global change research programs.  Specific activities will        
              include organizing meetings of scientific workshops to define research         
              activities on algal blooms, ecosystem dynamics, and coastal                    
              oceanography; assisting in the organization and implementation of the          
              above IOC programs; and representation of these IOC scientific programs        
              in international scientific meetings, workshops, and conferences.
