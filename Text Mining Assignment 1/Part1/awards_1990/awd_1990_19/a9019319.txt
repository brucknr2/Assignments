Abstract    :
              Mu is a fascinating bacteriophage whose genome replicates as a DNA             
              transposon.  Mu has been extensively studied and now serves as a               
              model system for transposable elements and viruses.  Mu has also               
              became a valuable genetic tool for many biological applications                
              including insertion mutagenesis, gene transduction and                         
              translocation, chromosome marking and mapping,  DNA cloning, DNA               
              sequencing, and gene fusing for studies of gene expression and                 
              regulation.  These genetic applications also serve as models for               
              applications of other transposons and viruses in different                     
              biological systems.  Further studies and applications of Mu and                
              related phage are proposed, with extensions to other bacterial                 
              species.  Specifically, 1) the targeting of Mu transposition will              
              be studied with fusions of the Mu B gene to the DNA binding protein            
              gene lacI, 2) the rfa host receptor genes for the Mu and related               
              phage will be studied in Escherichia coli and Salmonella                       
              typhimurium to understand their surface requirements for the                   
              lipopolysaccharide receptors and 3) the knowledge of their receptor            
              specificities will be used to extend the host range of these phage             
              and their applications to other Enterobacteriaceae.
