Abstract    :
                   An ADC is a device which is used to sample an analog signal               
              and converts it into a digital code proportional to its amplitude.             
              Nyquist theory states that the sampling frequency must be at least             
              twice the maximum frequency of the analog signal. Thus the speed               
              of existing ADCs limit the application of digital electronics in               
              systems that have wide bandwidth signals. There are applications               
              which demand bandwidths that exceed several hundred megahertz.                 
              Exploratory developments of electrooptic analog-to-digital                     
              converters (ADCs) capable of operating at 1 GHz with 6-bit                     
              resolution have been reported. This bit and frequency range is of              
              interest because existing silicon and gallium arsenide technology              
              have not been demonstrated above this range.                                   
              %%%                                                                            
                   The purpose of the proposed research is to develop a wide                 
              bandwidth electrooptic ADC which operates at 10 GHz with 6-bit                 
              resolution.
