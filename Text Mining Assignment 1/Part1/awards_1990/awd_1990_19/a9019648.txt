Abstract    :
              The extraction of quantitative information from fluorescent                    
              probes in living cells using videomicroscopy is emerging as an                 
              exciting new approach to the problem of visualizing cell                       
              dynamics.  Probes which sense cation and anion concentrations, pH              
              and membrane potential allow temporal visualization of these                   
              processes, especially dyes which produce images at two different               
              wavelengths.  A potentially more exiting application is kinetics               
              of multiple dyes in the same living cell.                                      
                                                                                             
              Present research instruments use rotating filter wheels to change              
              wavelengths and are relatively slow in their data collection                   
              rates.  Also the high costs for hardware and software prices                   
              these custom machines out of the range of most laboratories.                   
                                                                                             
              Professor Morris and his group are developing a novel design of                
              fluorescence video digital imaging microscope, which captures two              
              video images simultaneously.  It is capable of both single                     
              excitation/dual emission, for simultaneous observation of two                  
              probes in the same live cell.  It has no moving parts allowing                 
              data collection at any rate for which compatible cameras and                   
              storage devices exist.  The data collection system uses the AT-                
              bussed PC computer and standard RS-170 video equipment which                   
              reduces the cost of the system.  Thus it represents state-of-the-              
              art technology at very affordable prices.
