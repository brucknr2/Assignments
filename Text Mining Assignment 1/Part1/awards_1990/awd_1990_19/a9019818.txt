Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              The investigator and his research group are starting a                         
              program to develop more sophisticated models of premixed                       
              turbulent combustion, in which the interactions between                        
              the fast chemical reactions typical of combustion and the                      
              fluctuations in density, concentration, and temperature                        
              that accompany turbulence are addressed in more detail.                        
              These interactions appear as integrals along the flame                         
              surface separating the hot product gases from the cold                         
              reactant gases.  The major difficulty in approximating                         
              these integrals is that distortion of the flame surface by                     
              turbulence at all scales is relevant and ultimately                            
              impacts on the rate of reaction in the flame.                                  
              Experimental information about the interactions is                             
              required to develop a more thorough understanding of the                       
              fundamental processes at work in the flame brush.  The                         
              investigator proposes to study these processes using                           
              numerical simulations of a hypothetical flame sheet                            
              passing through homogeneous turbulence, as an                                  
              experimental tool.  The most important limitation of                           
              simulations is the relatively modest Reynolds numbers that                     
              are achievable, due to constraints of computational speed                      
              and storage.  However, for simple flow systems they have                       
              shown that they can accurately represent turbulence over a                     
              range of scales that is sufficient for the purposes of                         
              this proposal.  The MRI planning grant is intended to fund                     
              preliminary studies that will allow to 1) develop the                          
              capability to simulate turbulent flames, and 2) develop                        
              tools to interpret the results of those simulations to                         
              improve the overall modeling effort.
