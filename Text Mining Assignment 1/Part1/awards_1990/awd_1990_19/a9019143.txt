Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The Soviet Republic of Armenia lies along the southern                    
              boundary of the Caucasus Mountains; a chain uplifted by the                    
              collision of the Arabian and Eurasian continental plates.                      
              Seismic research in the region is especially significant in view               
              of the history of active earthquakes, including the 1988 quake                 
              which killed more than 25,000 persons in northern Armenia.  A                  
              more detailed picture of the seismicity and associated tectonic                
              features is essential for an earthquake hazard assessment.  This               
              interagency transfer of funds to the U. S. Geological Survey is                
              intended to cover the costs of the purchase of seismometer                     
              equipment and the development of seismic analysis computer                     
              software needed to deploy a portable seismometer array in                      
              Armenia.  The armenian field campaign using this array will last               
              approximately 9 months and is part of the Eurasian Seismic                     
              Studies Program, jointly executed by the U.S. Geological Survey                
              and the Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology under                
              the aegis of the US-USSR Agreement on Cooperation in the Field of              
              Environmental Protection (Project 02.09-31).
