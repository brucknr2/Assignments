Abstract    :
              This project represents a request for supplemental support for                 
              salary and expendables to permit participation in EUMELI 2,                    
              France's component of JGOFS.  The project will be carried out in               
              conjunction with French marine scientists who will be conducting               
              multidisciplinary studies aboard the new IFREMER research vessel,              
              ATLANTE, at a series of stations off NW Africa.  The PI has been               
              invited to participate in one leg of a 3-leg expedition presently              
              scheduled for February 1991.  IFREMER will provide G. Rowe and G.              
              Boland with travel and shipping funds, and will make ship time                 
              available. The project will provide a benthic lander to measure                
              total community respiration and dissolved inorganic nutrient                   
              regeneration, a newly described box core to take undisturbed                   
              bottom samples, and an array of near-bottom sediment traps.                    
              The GOMEX box corer  will allow quantification of the biomass of               
              the three principal size groups in the sediments - the bacteria,               
              meiofauna and macrofauna.  Direct comparisons will be made                     
              between this new device and the USNEL spade core to be used by                 
              IFREMER on the expedition.  This also provides an opportunity to               
              compare the Texas A&M lander with the lander used by Dr. Richard               
              Jahnke, a geochemist, another U.S. invited participant.                        
              Short-term sediment trap samples form deep, near-bottom moored                 
              traps will be used to provide fresh, unadulterated samples to                  
              chemists and microbiologists, and for comparison with long-term                
              and short-term flux measures to be conducted by IFREMER at their               
              designated sites.
