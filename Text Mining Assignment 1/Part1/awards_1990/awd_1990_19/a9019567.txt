Abstract    :
              This project has two tasks.  The first is to continue the analysis             
              of data obtained from electric field and x-ray instruments flown               
              in Antarctica in the past.  The second is to provide electric field            
              measuring instruments for long duration balloons to be flown by the            
              Japanese from Syowa Station, Antarctica, and to analyze the                    
              resulting data.  These Polar Patrol Balloons (PPB) are expected to             
              circumnavigate the south pole several times and to have flight                 
              times of approximately one month.  They will, in the course of                 
              their flights, cover geomagnetic latitudes ranging from the high               
              polar cap to the mid-latitude ion trough.                                      
                                                                                             
              The main focus of the research will be on ultra-low frequency (ULF)            
              waves.  The proposers will perform a statistical study of the ratio            
              of electrical to magnetic field strength as a function of                      
              frequency, geomagnetic activity, magnetic local time and magnetic              
              latitude.  These studies will provide data on the variation of                 
              geoelectric activity at different times in the solar cycle.                    
              Simultaneous coordinated measurements were made during the earlier             
              campaign by several ground based instruments including the PACE                
              radar, and this will also be done during the Japanese Polar Patrol             
              Balloon flights.
