Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              Free Electron Lasers (FEL's) are novel sources of coherent                     
              electromagnetic radiation whose emissions arise from the                       
              nonlinear coupling of a relativistic electron beam with a                      
              spatially periodic wiggler.  In this research the                              
              investigator proposes to investigate and formulate the                         
              physics and design issues associated with the use of the                       
              CEBAF electron beam and a plasma wave wiggler to produce                       
              short wavelength FEL radiation.  This unique electron                          
              source and advanced wiggler concept combine to form an                         
              innovative radiative source for solid state and medical                        
              research applications.  In the planning grant period, an                       
              extensive review of the methods of analysis for each of                        
              the program objectives will be conducted.  Additionally,                       
              an extension of the present theory of magnetic field error                     
              will be extended to plasma wave wigglers.  These                               
              preliminary results will form the basis and details on                         
              which the proposed program objectives will be achieved.
