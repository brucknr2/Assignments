Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Department of Astronomy of the University of Wisconsin-                    
              Madison (UW) has an active staff engaged in a wide range of                    
              research activities.  The primary computer is a VAX 11/780                     
              purchased over a decade ago for use in conjunction with an image-              
              display and PDS plate-scanning device.  This award partially                   
              matched by the UW, will upgrade the computing facility to a                    
              modern one.  The system will consist of SUN workstations with a                
              central server to handle image-processing and heavy numerical                  
              tasks, a smaller DEC device (using VMS) to which existing disks,               
              peripherals, and workstations will be connected, and a separate                
              PC class machine to control an upgraded PDS.
