Abstract    :
              Anabaena PCC7120 is a filamentous cyanobacterium that enters a                 
              developmental pathway in response to nitrogen starvation.  The                 
              culmination of this pathway is the differentiation of heterocysts,             
              cells specialized for nitrogen fixation.  The development of                   
              heterocysts includes the appearance of gene products involved in               
              nitrogen fixation, the disappearance of certain gene products                  
              involved in photosynthesis and the constitutive expression other               
              gene products such as those involved in energy metabolism.  We have            
              isolated expression other gene products such as those involved in              
              energy metabolism.  We have isolated and determined the sequence               
              of sixteen photosynthesis genes that comprise eight transcription              
              units within the Anabaena genome, and one gene involved in carbon              
              metabolism.  These genes fall into two classes: 1) those that are              
              constituitively expressed and 2) those that are expressed only in              
              vegetative cells.  Based on comparative sequence analysis around               
              the transcription initiation sites utilized during vegetative                  
              growth, we predict that one transcription signal lies at -10                   
              nucleotides from the transcription initiation site.  We have                   
              developed a system for the functional analysis of Anabaena                     
              promoters in vivo.  We will use this system and the characterized              
              genes to define the promoters utilized for transcription in                    
              undifferentiated vegetative cells and to examine whether promoter              
              utilization plays a role in differential gene expression during                
              heterocyst development.
