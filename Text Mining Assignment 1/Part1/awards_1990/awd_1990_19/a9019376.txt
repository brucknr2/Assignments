Abstract    :
                   In recent years environmental concerns about anthropogenic                
              perturbations to the earth's middle atmosphere have led to the                 
              development of many radiative photochemical-dynamical coupled                  
              models to study basic chemical and physical processes and their                
              long term effects.  This grant aims to develop an improved                     
              computer model of infrared  radiative cooling/heating based on                 
              recent research by the principal investigator.  Research on                    
              radiative damping in the middle atmosphere  will be performed to               
              investigate its importance in wave mean-flow interactions.                     
              Related work will focus on improving our understanding of gravity              
              wave saturation by studying gravity waves radiating from a region              
              of wave forcing in the vicinity of a critical level through                    
              geostrophic adjustment or instability.  Finally, an effort will                
              be made to understand why ground-based microwave measurements of               
              mesospheric H2O seasonal concentration variation inconsistent                  
              with SME derived semiannual variations of 03.  The H                           
              measurements show very large semiannual variations which are                   
              consistent with SME derived semiannual variations of 03 densities              
              at 80km, while the inferred O concentrations at 80 km show a                   
              predominantly annual variation well correlated with the H2O                    
              measurements but, on the basis of current photochemical theory,                
              inconsistent with the seasonal H 03 density variation.
