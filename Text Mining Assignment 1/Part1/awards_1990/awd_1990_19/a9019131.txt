Abstract    :
              Failure to adapt to prolonged isolation and extreme conditions of              
              polar environments can have adverse consequences for both the                  
              individual and the organization.  Despite decades of research,                 
              the identification of social and psychological characteristics                 
              associated with successful adaptation and performance in these                 
              settings remains problematic.  Building upon the results of                    
              preliminary work conducted both in Antarctica and in the Canadian              
              High Arctic, the proposed study will focus on social and                       
              psychological characteristics that predict performance and                     
              adaptation in both polar regions.  Research will be conducted at               
              McMurdo Station in Antarctica and four Atmospheric Environmental               
              Service weather stations in the Canadian High Arctic using a                   
              battery of psychological screening instruments and a standardized              
              debriefing protocol.  This study will add to our understanding of              
              the social and psychological sequellae of adaptation and                       
              adjustment in polar regions contributing to group morale and                   
              well-being, improved safety, and performance in these regions.                 
              In addition, the research will explicate fundamental                           
              interrelationships among environmental stress, coping resources,               
              personality traits, and performance, and provide a growing data                
              base for comparative and cross-cultural studies of adaptation and              
              performance in polar environments.
