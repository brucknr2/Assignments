Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              This Science in Developing Countries award will help to                        
              support a regional workshop on random materials and processes                  
              in Barbados.  The workshop, organized by Professor Eugene                      
              Stanley of Boston University and Professor Leo Moseley of the                  
              University of the West Indies in Barbados, together with                       
              Professor Miguel Octavio of the Instituto Venezolano de                        
              Investigaciones Cientificas (IVIC) in Venezuela, will bring                    
              together scientists from the Caribbean, Latin America and                      
              Europe as well as from the U.S.                                                
                                                                                             
              Random materials and processes is a relatively new interdis-                   
              ciplinary field whose goal is to understand a large class of                   
              phenomena and structures, which at the microscopic level are                   
              random and unpredictable but reveal structure and predic-                      
              tability in the large.  Indeed, a very large part of our                       
              natural environment as well as a substantial fraction of man-                  
              made objects, including glasses, polymers and amorphous                        
              materials are examples of these materials.  Thus the area is                   
              one of interest to a broad range of scientists and subject to                  
              various approaches: from the purely mathematical to the level                  
              of direct engineering applicability.  In keeping with the                      
              goals of the Science in Developing Countries Program, the                      
              workshop has been designed to reach engineers, scientists,                     
              and mathematicians interested in recent progress in this                       
              multi-disciplinary field.
