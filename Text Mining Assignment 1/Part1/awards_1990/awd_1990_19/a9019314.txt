Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Simulation and sensitivity studies will be done to evaluate the                
              potential for using electro-magnetic (EM) techniques to determine              
              large-scale properties of oceanic transport.  Output from the                  
              Community Modeling Effort (CME) will be used to provide gridded                
              information at basin scale for the North Atlantic Ocean.  Special              
              attention will be on the effects of seafloor topography, spatial               
              variation of the geomagnetic field, variable sediment thickness,               
              and non-locally generated electric currents.
