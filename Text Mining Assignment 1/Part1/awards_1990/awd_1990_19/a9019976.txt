Abstract    :
              This study proposes to develop a theory of heterogeneous                       
              poroelastic media whose material properties are                                
              characterized by several distinct length scales (e.g.                          
              grains, layers, global). The modern mathematical techniques                    
              of homogenization theory, so far developed for composite                       
              media will be extended. The constitutive coefficients for                      
              quasi static thermal consolidation, and dynamic                                
              poroelasticity will be studied. Explicit calculations for a                    
              simple but versatile 3-D micro structure (Wigner-Seitz                         
              polyhedron) will be performed. The transversely isotropic                      
              macroscale equations will be solved for several physical                       
              problems such as the rising geothermal plume, the submerged                    
              point sink, etc., and seismic wave propagation.
