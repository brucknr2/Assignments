Abstract    :
              This proposal described experiments to test the hypothesis that                
              the mechanism by which insulin increases cellular seryl/threonyl               
              protein phosphorylation is mediated, in part, by the                           
              phosphorylation and activation of a distinct protamine kinase and              
              by the phosphorylation and inactivation of protein phosphatase 2A              
              mediate by the protamine kinase.  Specifically, immunological and              
              biochemical experiments are described (a) to demonstrate that the              
              rat hepatocyte insulin-stimulated protamine kinase is related to               
              a previously characterized protamine kinase from bovine kidney                 
              cytosol, (b) to provide direct evidence that insulin stimulates                
              the activity of the protamine kinase via increased                             
              phosphorylation of this enzyme, and (c) to examine to regulation               
              by insulin protein phosphatase 2A.  Together, these studies will               
              establish the molecular basis, intracellular relevance and                     
              function of insulin stimulation of the protamine kinase.  The                  
              information derived from these studies is critical for an                      
              understanding of the metabolic function and regulation of                      
              insulin-stimulated phosphorylation.
