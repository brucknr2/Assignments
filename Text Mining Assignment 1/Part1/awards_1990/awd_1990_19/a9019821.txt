Abstract    :
                   The objective of this research is the investigation of the                
              initiation and evolution of convection along the Dryline of                    
              Northern Texas and Southern Oklahoma.  New observations will be                
              sought during a field experiment (COPS-91) which will include the              
              use and deployment of an aircraft, doppler radars, special                     
              rawindsondes, profiles, and 15 special surface meteorological                  
              stations supplied by NCAR.  The airborne doppler radar, on the                 
              NOAA aircraft (P-3), should provide the first assessment of                    
              mesoscale circulations normal to the Dryline.
