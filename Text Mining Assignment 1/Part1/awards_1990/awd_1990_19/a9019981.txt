Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This specialized beam line is under development at the Synchrotron             
              Radiation Center, University of Wisconsin.  The project includes               
              the construction of a new, high-efficiency undulator based beam                
              line on the storage ring, Aladdin, to be used to address the                   
              science and technology of high-temperature superconducting                     
              materials.  The beam line will have higher angle and energy                    
              resolution capabilities than presently available in the United                 
              States, and will provide a complementary capability to the efforts             
              now under development in France, Germany, and Japan.  This beam                
              line will be ideally suited for high-resolution photoelectron                  
              spectroscopic studies of high-temperature superconductors.  The                
              source will be a specially designed undulator.  The radiation will             
              be dispersed by a Wadsworth monochromator, with the grating being              
              the only optical element in the photon path.  The monochromatic                
              radiation will impinge on a two-hundred and fifty micron size spot             
              on the sample, which typically will be at low temperatures.  The               
              photoelectrons will be energy analyzed by a hemispherical capacitor            
              analyzer with a position-sensitive detector on a goniometer.                   
              Completion on this beam line is anticipated for late 1993, and will            
              be available to general users about one-fourth of the operating                
              time for broader applications.
