Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The San Deigo Supercomputer Center (SDSC) has developed for their              
              own use a software package to monitor the large number and variety             
              of computing and communication devices normally found in a large               
              computing center.  The software logs diagnostic messages from these            
              devices, and includes built-in intelligence to draw attention, the             
              software can be used to test communications paths among machines.              
              This results in a reduction in labor within the computing center,              
              and requires only a small personal computer as a hardware platform.            
                                                                                             
              In order to make this interesting and unique software product                  
              available nationally, this award to the SDSC will support:                     
                                                                                             
              1)   Enhancement of the existing software so it will be more                   
                   generally applicable,                                                     
                                                                                             
              2)   The development of documentation for dissemination over the               
                   national network, and                                                     
                                                                                             
              3)   Telephone consulting for a period of one year.
