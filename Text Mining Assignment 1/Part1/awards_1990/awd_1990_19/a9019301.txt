Abstract    :
              This renewal proposal is aimed at the synthesis and                            
              characterization of new nickel-based oxides with electronic and                
              structural features common to the copper-based high temperature                
              superconductors.  Chemical, electronic, magnetic, thermal, and                 
              transport properties will be investigated.
