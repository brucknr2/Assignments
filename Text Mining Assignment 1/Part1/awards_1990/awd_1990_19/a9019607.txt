Abstract    :
                   The PI will continue his work on the estimation of in situ                
              stress magnitudes from records of wellbore failure in ODP                      
              boreholes.  The oceanic basins have a notable lack of stress                   
              measurements.  The approach will be to use the borehole televiewer             
              and formation microscanner logs and measure rock strength in the               
              laboratory.  Numerical modelling of the lithospheric stress based              
              on thermal relaxation data will also be conducted.  This work will             
              provide useful data about the stress regime of oceanic crust.
