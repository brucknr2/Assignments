Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Despite a major focus on nitrogen as the limiting nutrient in                  
              marine ecosystems, there is evidence that in some marine                       
              environments, especially the vast oligotrophic central gyres,                  
              that phosphate appears to be refractory and potentially                        
              limiting, although a fraction of the phosphate pool does appear                
              to turn over rapidly.  Dissolved nucleic acids will be examined                
              as a model component of this rapidly-cycling fraction, because                 
              many of the breakdown rates and the concentrations of the                      
              resulting intermediates can be measured.  These parameters will                
              be measured by a combination of fluorometric, isotopic, and                    
              spectrophotometric techniques and will be compared to parallel                 
              measurement of the major phosphate pools and fluxes. This project              
              will test the hypotheses that microbial breakdown of                           
              dissolved nucleic acids is both: 1) a quantitatively important                 
              pathway, and 2) a model pathway for the cycling of labile                      
              dissolved organic phosphate in the oligotrophic North Atlantic.                
              This research will further our understanding of the cycling of                 
              dissolved organic phosphate, a suite of compounds with                         
              potentially global importance to marine primary production.                    
              Furthermore, this research will lead to insights into microbial                
              processes of biopolymer and monomer breakdown.  Finally, since                 
              dissolved nucleic acids are genetic material and also significant              
              reservoirs of dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen, these                     
              studies will increase our knowledge of environmental gene                      
              transfer and of dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen cycling in               
              the environment.
