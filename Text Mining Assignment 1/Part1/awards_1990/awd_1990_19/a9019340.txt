Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The three dimensional structure of the proteins involved                       
              in the phosphoenolpyruvate: sugar phosphotransferase                           
              system (PTS) will be determined by x-ray crystallography.                      
              This complex multi-enzyme system is one of the few                             
              transport systems whose components, including some of the                      
              membrane bound ones, have been purified.  The                                  
              crystallography will complement the molecular biology and                      
              biochemical aspects of a collaborative effect to study                         
              the mechanism by which bacteria employ a protein                               
              phosphoryl transfer chain to regulate sugar transport                          
              across the membrane.  The structure determination of the                       
              various proteins will facilitate the analysis of the                           
              nature of regulation by protein phosphorylation, and the                       
              conformational transition that accompanies such                                
              processes.  Since the PTS is unique to bacteria, the                           
              information obtained may pertain to our ability to take                        
              advantage of the PTS therapeutically.  At this state, the                      
              focus is on the soluble proteins.  Similar approaches                          
              will be used to obtain information about the                                   
              phosphorylated structures of the other PTS proteins.                           
              Structure determination will be done either by the                             
              Multiple Isomorphous Replacement or by the Molecular                           
              Replacement methods, depending on the problem.  For                            
              better accuracy, the determined structures will be                             
              refined to the highest resolution possible.  Once                              
              structures become available, mutants that probe the                            
              protein-protein and protein-substrate interactions will                        
              be designed and analyzed biochemically, and selected                           
              interesting mutants will be crystallized and their                             
              structure determined.
