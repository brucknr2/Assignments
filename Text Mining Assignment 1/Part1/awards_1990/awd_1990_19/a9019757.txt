Abstract    :
                   The importance of deep convection in the tropics to the                   
              global circulation has been recognized for some time.  In 1986 a               
              pilot experiment termed the Equatorial Mesoscale Experiment                    
              (EMEX) was held off the northern coast of Australia to obtain                  
              measurements of the characteristics of deep convection in that                 
              part of the world and the effect of that convection on the larger              
              scale environment.                                                             
                   The Principal Investigator will produce quantitative                      
              descriptions of the wind, thermal and moisture profiles within                 
              and in the immediate environment of equatorial cloud clusters.                 
              Similarities and differences of the results from earlier field                 
              experiments will be noted and, if appropriate, new conceptual                  
              models developed.  A major goal will be to investigate the                     
              effects on the large scales of motion of the vertical profile of               
              latent heating and sea-air exchanges.
