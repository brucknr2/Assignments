Abstract    :
                   Professors Olin and Thomson will continue their work on                   
              subnormal operator theory and its associated function theory                   
              problems.  This includes the study of various algebras generated               
              by the subnormal operators and their associated representations.               
              The study of the function spaces associated to these algebras                  
              will also be pursued.  This work may have applications to several              
              areas of mathematics including measure theory, Borel analysis,                 
              ergodic theory, and function theory.                                           
                        Hilbert space operators are essentially infinite                     
              matrices of complex numbers.  These operators have applications                
              in every area of applied science as well as in pure mathematics.               
              This type of research is an attempt to categorize certain                      
              important classes of such objects.
