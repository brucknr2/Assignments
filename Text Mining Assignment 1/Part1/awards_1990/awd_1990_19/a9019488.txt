Abstract    :
              These investigations are designed to characterize the mechanism by             
              which a nuclear plastome mutator (pm) gene causes mutations in the             
              plastid genome (plastome) of Oenothera.  Genetic and molecular                 
              traits shared by pm and various bacterial mutators are consistent              
              with the pm gene encoding a topoisomerase, helicase, or polymerase             
              that functions within the chloroplast (cp).  Another possibility is            
              that absence of the pm-product increases levels of error-prone                 
              repair of cpDNA.  Experiments to differentiate among these                     
              alternatives include chemical mutagenesis treatments of pm seeds,              
              where a synergistic response to a number of mutagens will indicate             
              a general defect in a component of cpDNA repair.  Determination of             
              the extent of slipped strand mispairing in the pm isolates will                
              show the likelihood that a defective helicase or topoisomerase is              
              involved.  Other experiments are designed to locate the sites of               
              existing pm-mutations, and to isolate new pm-mutations in the rbcL             
              gene.  Sequence data from these sites will indicate whether pm                 
              causes base substitutions, small deletions, or other alterations,              
              as well as sizeable deletions observed in other, non-coding regions            
              of cpDNA and occurring between short direct repeats.                           
                                                                                             
              In addition to providing insights into the molecular events that               
              result in the mutation of cpDNA, these investigations are pertinent            
              to the history of the cpDNA molecule, which, in an evolutionary                
              time frame, has experienced frequent deletions, insertions and                 
              inversions mediated by short direct repeats.***
