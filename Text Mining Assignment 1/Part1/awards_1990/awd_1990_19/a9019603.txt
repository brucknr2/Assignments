Abstract    :
              Observations of the atmosphere through remote sensing and in-situ              
              measurement are necessary for advancement in atmospheric science.              
              Instrumented research aircraft are invaluable in providing these               
              observations over the last four decades.  The need for such                    
              aircraft will be great over the next few years for research                    
              covering a broad range of research problems including atmospheric              
              chemistry, mesoscale meteorology and cloud physics.  These areas               
              of atmospheric science are high priority research areas for the                
              next decade.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              This award makes available to  the entire atmospheric sciences                 
              community the University of Wyoming King Air research aircraft.                
              The Wyoming King Air will be treated as all other atmospheric                  
              sciences community facilities with allocation being made by an                 
              NSF Facility Advisory Council based on a community peer-review                 
              process.  The University of Wyoming personnel are experienced in               
              airborne research and the King Air is a state-of-the-technology                
              research platform.  During a previous three year award, the                    
              University demonstrated exceptional performance in servicing the               
              community needs.  This award also helps maintain an active                     
              program in airborne research at the University of Wyoming and                  
              extend this educational benefit to other institutions through                  
              emerging agreements with other universities.  The University of                
              Wyoming produced many excellent airborne research scientists over              
              the last three years.
