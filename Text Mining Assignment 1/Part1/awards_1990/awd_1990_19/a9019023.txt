Abstract    :
                   The comparison of paleoclimate data with General                          
              Circulation Model (GCM) simulations of past conditions on earth                
              provides one of the best methods to test model accuracy and                    
              sensitivity.  Important discrepancies exist between the results                
              of the models and the existing data.  One prominent discrepancy                
              is in the southeastern US during the early Holocene.  For that                 
              time, GCMs suggest that climate was much warmer than is observed               
              in the existing paleoclimate data.  The goal of this research                  
              program is to resolve this discrepancy by reanalyzing the                      
              existing paleoclimate data from this region and provide new,                   
              independent measurements of past conditions.  The research is                  
              important because it will help to confirm the accuracy of the                  
              NCAR GCM, a model that is used quite extensively to predict the                
              future climatic effects resulting from the introduction of                     
              greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.
