Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              The investigator proposes to study populations of African                      
              American mothers and children in the Hampton Roads area of                     
              Virginia.  She will attempt to reach a variety of mother-                      
              child dyads that vary in socioeconomic status, age and                         
              education.  Mothers who are identified for the study will                      
              be contacted by the researcher first by letter and then by                     
              a follow up phone call in which the study will be                              
              explained in more detail and appointments will be made to                      
              further explain the experimental procedures.  Mother and                       
              child interaction will be studied by using videotapes to                       
              record different responses such as body contact,                               
              affection, vocalization, positioning etc...  Videotapes to                     
              maximize the accuracy of observations.  Tapes will be                          
              observed by trained judges who will be blind to the                            
              hypotheses and other data collected on the subjects.  The                      
              investigator proposes to use a sample of 100 mothers with                      
              infants.  She will use multiple regression analysis using                      
              the attachment status of the 16 month old infant as the                        
              criterion, and the other variables as predictors.  The                         
              effect of age, education and socioeconomic status will be                      
              determined by analysis of co-variance.
