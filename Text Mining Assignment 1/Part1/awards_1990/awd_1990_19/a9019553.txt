Abstract    :
              The objective of this research is to study fundamental                         
              aspects concerning the microstructural stress-strain                           
              behavior of cohesive soils by conducting in a systematic                       
              manner laboratory experiments on a number of real clayey                       
              soils, and numerical experiments on assembly of clay                           
              particles. Scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction                     
              and electrical methods will be employed in characterizing                      
              the fabric of laboratory specimens. Numerical experiments                      
              will be simulated using the  Distinct Element Method.
