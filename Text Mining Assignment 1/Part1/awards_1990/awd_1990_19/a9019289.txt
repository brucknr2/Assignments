Abstract    :
                   Previous magnetostratigraphic work has (1) located the upper              
              and lower boundaries of the Olduvai magnetic Chron in lake                     
              sediments from Southern Death Valley, (2) found similar boundaries             
              of what is probably the Jaramillo Chron in ancient lake Manix near             
              Barstow in the Mojave desert, and (3) located what may be the                  
              Mammoth and Kaena events in the Pico formation of the Ventura                  
              Basin.  The PI will sample these reversal horizons in high                     
              resolution to determine their temporal, chemical,a nd geomagnetic              
              characteristics.  High-fidelity records of the field are present,              
              apparently including secular variations and geomagnetic reversals.
