Abstract    :
                   This grant will fund 30 travel awards to enable young                     
              statisticians and more senior statisticians who have no support to             
              attend the 48th session of the International Statistical Institute,            
              Cairo, Egypt, September 9-17, 1991.  These biennial meetings bring             
              together experts in numerous statistical fields from throughout the            
              world, as well as many younger researchers who have a unique                   
              opportunity to meet, converse with, and discuss specific programs              
              with the outstanding experts in the particular areas.  Further,                
              there is opportunity for various researchers, not only in                      
              theoretical statistics, but many areas of application, ranging from            
              the behavioral, social and physical sciences, to the health                    
              sciences and engineering to mingle and exchange methodology and                
              results.
