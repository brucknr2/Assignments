Abstract    :
              University of Dayton's program is to enhance the role of women in              
              materials engineering with a special emphasis on the area of titanium          
              and titanium casting technology.  The program combines the technical           
              program in the Titanium Technology area with a substantially modified          
              Women in Engineering recruitment system named Women in Graduate                
              Materials Studies (WINGES) which provides doctoral education and               
              research opportunities for three women materials engineers.
