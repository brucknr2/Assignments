Abstract    :
              NSF matching funds are requested to help purchase an Imaging                   
              Plate X-ray Area Detector for shared use by two independent                    
              crystallography groups at the Rockefeller University.  These two               
              groups, headed by John Kuriyan and Stephen K. Burley, are                      
              exploring the intrinsic link between the three-dimensional                     
              structures of macromolecules and their biological function.  In                
              collaboration with groups at Rockefeller and elsewhere, the                    
              projects underway include structure-function studies on:  (1)                  
              flavo-protein disulfide reductases (J.K.), (2) bacterial                       
              oxidative stress sensors and transcriptional regulation of                     
              oxidative stress-induced enzymes (J.K.), (3) developmental gene                
              products in Drosophila (J.K.), (4) eukaryotic transcription                    
              factor IID or TATA factor (S.K.B.), (5) eukaryotic                             
              transcriptional upstream stimulator factor (S.K.B.).  A rotating-              
              anode X-ray generator and a high speed 4-circle single counter                 
              diffractometer have already been purchased, along with associated              
              computing equipment.  Acquisition of the proposed area detector                
              will result in a state-of-the-art X-ray data collection facility.
