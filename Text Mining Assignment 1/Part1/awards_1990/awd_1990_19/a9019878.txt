Abstract    :
              This award provides funds for the Principal Investigator to study              
              the application of a multi-parameter adaptive control algorithm to             
              astronomical adaptive optics.  If successful, this method would                
              obviate the need for complex interferometers and wavefront sensor              
              systems.  Based on an approach patented by the Principal                       
              Investigator and his collaborator, the method utilizes a simple                
              cost function to provide feedback to the variables that are being              
              controlled.  It promises to be fast and easy to realize in                     
              hardware.
