Abstract    :
                   The objective of the proposed research is to utilize expert               
              systems technology to interact between the last amount of data                 
              available from Geographic Information Systems and hydrological                 
              and/or environmental watershed models. Watershed programs such as              
              HEC1 and HEC2 require a large number of variables which are                    
              available or could be extracted from Geographic Information                    
              Systems. Another objective of the proposal is to relate economics              
              to land use and development. This will result in an environmental              
              accounting system which could lead to a true value of proposed                 
              development of a given watershed.

                   It is the goal of this project to develop the required                    
              methods, procedures, and software under an expert system shell to              
              establish the connection between the Geographic Information System,            
              HEC1 and HEC2.
