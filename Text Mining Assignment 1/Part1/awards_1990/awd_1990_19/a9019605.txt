Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              This planning grant proposal is designed to evaluate the                       
              accuracy and precision of a non-destructive sampling                           
              technique that would enable researchers to acquire data on                     
              N partitioning and remobilization by periodically excising                     
              leaf discs from the same leaves of individual plants.                          
              This could substantially reduce the cost of time-course                        
              15N experiments in terms of space and labor, while greatly                     
              facilitating the acquisition of information to help                            
              assess the role of N in plant strategies which result in                       
              increased productivity and resistance to stressful                             
              environments.  The proposed method would promote research                      
              in this area and could be used simultaneously with 14C to                      
              enable study of C and N partitioning and remobilization in                     
              diverse environments, genotypes and species.  The                              
              technique would be usable in field and controlled                              
              environments and could prove to be a valuable screening                        
              tool useful with plant breeding if N partitioning and                          
              remobilization are found to be one of the strategies which                     
              provide adaptation to moisture stress either universally                       
              or in environments that experience a specific type of                          
              drought.
