Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The post-peak response of soils governs the behavior of soil                   
              masses subjected to moderate to high levels of strain; this                    
              occurs during earthquake-induced flow failures, such as slope                  
              instabilities or bearing capacity failure.  Examples of                        
              earthquake-induced flow failures are the failure of the Lower                  
              San Fernando dam in 1971, failure of tailings dams in Chile                    
              in 1965 and 1985, and the bearing capacity failures in                         
              Niigata, Japan, in 1964.                                                       
                                                                                             
              The objective of this research program is to provide                           
              experimental evidence of the nature of the post-peak                           
              response of soils and to cast these results into a manageable                  
              theoretical framework.  The concept of an undrained steady-                    
              state strength as a limiting shearing resistance for a soil                    
              undergoing steady-state deformations provides a framework                      
              for evaluating liquefaction and flow slide potential.  It is                   
              imperative that uniform strains develop in laboratory tests                    
              used to define this relationship; thus the uniformity of                       
              deformation is being examined experimentally by shearing                       
              specimens of saturated sands in both servo-controlled,                         
              heavily-instrumented plane strain compression and a                            
              standard triaxial device.
