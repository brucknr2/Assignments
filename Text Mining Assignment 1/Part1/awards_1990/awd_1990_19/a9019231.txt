Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The isotopic composition of seawater boron (11B/10B) is highly                 
              enriched (~40 per mil) relative to fresh mantle derived rocks.                 
              Initial work indicates that this enrichment is primarily the                   
              result of large isotopic fractionations associated with the                    
              alteration of the oceanic crust.  In addition, the boron                       
              isotopic composition of the altered crust is dominated by                      
              seawater boron that appears to be distinct from the mantle and                 
              may be composed of compositionally distinct domains.  As a                     
              result, it appears that boron isotopes have a great potential                  
              for elucidating a number of geochemical and geophysical                        
              problems associated with the alteration of the oceanic crust.                  
              These include the role of subducted volatiles in island-arc and                
              ocean island volcanism, the evolution of hydrothermal fluids                   
              and secular changes in seawater/crust exchange.                                
                                                                                             
              This study of seawater/oceanic crust boron isotope exchange has                
              the following specific goals:  1) to determine the distribution                
              of boron and boron isotopes within  the altered crust, 2) to                   
              quantify the net flux and isotopic composition of boron                        
              extracted from seawater into the oceanic crust and 3) to                       
              develop the essential background data that are required for the                
              future exploitation of boron isotopes as a diagnostic tool in                  
              the study of hydrothermal systems.
