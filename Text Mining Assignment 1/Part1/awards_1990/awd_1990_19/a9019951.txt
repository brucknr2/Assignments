Abstract    :
                   The extraction of three-dimensional information from two-                 
              dimensional views is an important aspect of the inspection of                  
              manufactured products. The determination of the quality of the                 
              product often depends on accurate three-dimensional information.               
              Depth information is especially important in the inspection of                 
              nominally-smooth surfaces for defects.

                   This research intends to determine the three-dimensional                  
              structure of a nominally-smooth surface from a sequence of images              
              acquired from a single point of view, where in each image, the                 
              object is illuminated by collimated light emanating from a unique              
              direction.
