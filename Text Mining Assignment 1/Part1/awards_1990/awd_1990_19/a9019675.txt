Abstract    :
              In this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organo-                    
              metallic Program of the Chemistry Division, Arnold will study                  
              metal complexes containing sterically hindered tellurolate                     
              ligands.  The long term goals of the research are to better                    
              define the coordination chemistry of tellurolate ligands via                   
              comparisons with related alkoxides and thiolates and, in doing                 
              so, to provide a rational basis for the design of molecular                    
              precursors to a variety of potentially useful solid-state                      
              materials.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              Considerable attention has been focused on a range of metal                    
              compounds incorporating tellurium due to their novel chemical,                 
              optical and electronic properties.  In contrast to the large                   
              body of data pertaining to the solid-state properties of these                 
              materials, however, there continues to exist a large gap in our                
              knowledge relating to the chemistry of discrete metal-tellurium                
              bonds.  This project outlines work aimed at developing the                     
              general chemistry of such interactions by studying metal                       
              complexes incorporating organotellurium ligands.  A particular                 
              focus of the work is to better define the coordination                         
              chemistry of tellurolate ligands by probing new synthetic                      
              routes to discrete, monomeric tellurolate species with bulky                   
              aryl, alkyl, silyl and related substituents.  This type of                     
              approach can be compared to recent advances in corresponding                   
              alkoxide and thiolates, where use of bulky ligands has resulted                
              in a much more detailed understanding of the properties of                     
              metal-oxygen and metal-sulfur bonds. Since relatively few metal                
              tellurolates are known, this chemistry will be developed across                
              a broad spectrum of main group and transition elements in order                
              to address specific questions regarding bonding and reactivity.
