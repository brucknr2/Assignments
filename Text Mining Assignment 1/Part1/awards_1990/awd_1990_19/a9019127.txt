Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                     In this Accomplishment.Based renewal, the P.I. will continue           
              the analysis of data collected on two Sea.Beam and SeaMarc II                  
              mapping projects on the Easter Microplate. Accomplishments to dte              
              include establishment of the tectonic setting; mapping of                      
              propogating ridges and transform faults that boundt the region;                
              spreading rates are the fastest of any ridge system yet studied;               
              beyond a certain rate, spreading ridges are not segmented by                   
              transformed faults; the microplate originated about 4.5 Ma and                 
              has been rotating as a rigid body for at least the last 0.75 Ma.               
                      This final funding will allow the PI to complete mapping of            
              the structural lineaments observed in the SeaMarc II data.
