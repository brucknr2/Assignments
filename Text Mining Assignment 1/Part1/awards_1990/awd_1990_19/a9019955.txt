Abstract    :
                   The objective of this research is the development of a                    
              prototype compact cryogenic cutting system that employs water jet              
              cutting principles for emergency rescue missions. The envisioned               
              prototype will use cryogenic fluid with application temperatures               
              low enough to embrittle and fracture structural materials through              
              a local build-up of thermal and mechanical stresses. The                       
              embrittlement resulting from the cryogenic fluid will be utilized              
              through water jet technology to optimize metal cutting process in              
              selective areas. The significance of this research is the                      
              development of a new generation of compact emergency cutting tools             
              that use cryogenic fluid to replace flame and minimize (or                     
              eliminate) spark-generating impact.
