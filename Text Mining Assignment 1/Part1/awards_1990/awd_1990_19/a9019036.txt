Abstract    :
              The goal of the project is to elucidate mechanisms of genetic                  
              instability in Neurospora.  Knowledge gained from the project                  
              should shed light on several general areas: recombination,                     
              mutation, and evolution.  In addition, the project has practical               
              significance for Neurospora geneticists and researchers working                
              on related fungi (e.g. plant pathogens).  During the grant period              
              we will: 1) determine whether RIP is responsible for low-                      
              frequency inactivation of duplicate genes in vegetative tissue;                
              2) attempt to derepress RIP, by mutations, in vegetative cells                 
              for use in subsequent genetic and biochemical experiments; 3)                  
              isolate mutants deficient in RIP; 4) determine if an inverted                  
              linked duplication is subject to RIP, premeiotic reciprocal                    
              recombination, or both (to provide a test of the idea that high-               
              frequency premeiotic deletion of sequences between linked                      
              duplications results from reciprocal recombination and to provide              
              information for a potential approach to isolate RIP mutants); 5)               
              determine if unlinked duplications are subject to recombination                
              processes ("gene conversion" and reciprocal exchange) prior to                 
              meiosis; 6) identify the postulated DNA-cytosine deaminase                     
              involved in RIP; 7) investigate the resistance to RIP of rDNA,                 
              and the effect of RIP on the transposon Tad.  Filamentous fungi                
              have an unusual process, known as RIP, by which they inactive all              
              but one copy of most genes present in more than one copy.  This                
              process was discovered by the Principal Investigator during a                  
              previous NSF award.  The mechanism and significance of this                    
              process are unclear, and the PI hopes to learn more about them                 
              during this award.  A better understanding of RIP will lead to                 
              more effective methods for genetic manipulation of industrially                
              important fungi.
