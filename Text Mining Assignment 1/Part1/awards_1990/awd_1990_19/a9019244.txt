Abstract    :
              The program in the McCormick School of Engineering at Northwestern             
              University is to support seven fellowships for PhD students.  Efforts          
              will be directed toward recruiting students who are women, minorities          
              and/or persons with disabilities; emphasis will be on selecting those          
              students who would not pursue this degree on their own.  Special efforts       
              will be directed toward motivating and recruiting well-qualified               
              undergraduate students with undergraduate training in engineering, the         
              physical sciences or mathematics to undertake PhD studies in the               
              engineering disciplines.  The special resources of the engineering             
              school will be combined with focused recruiting and support activities         
              to accomplish the goals of the program.
