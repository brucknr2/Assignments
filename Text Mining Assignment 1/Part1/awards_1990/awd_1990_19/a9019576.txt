Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Dr. Herbig will continue his observational research into the nature            
              of diffuse interstellar bands.  It includes an effort to correlate             
              the strengths of the diffuse bands with local properties of the                
              interstellar medium through high-precision observations of stars               
              imbedded in ionized hydrogen clouds, of stars behind clouds in                 
              which the coatings of the interstellar dust grains have to some                
              extent been removed, and of stars behind shocked interstellar gas.             
              Dr. Herbig wil also search for interstellar polyatomic carbon                  
              molecules.  These studies depend upon the special advantages of                
              observing from the high altitude site of Mauna Kea in Hawaii.                  
                                                                                             
              The problem of the identification of the carrier of the diffuse                
              interstellar band (DIB) spectrum remains unsolved over fifty years             
              after it was demonstrated that these features are produced by some             
              constituent of the interstellar medium.  With the availability of              
              new detectors the list of diffuse interstellar bands has grown to              
              some 50 sure entries, to which can be added at least 20 more weak              
              features that have recently been found in the red and near infrared            
              regions of the spectrum.  Still no convincing regularities in DIB              
              characteristics are apparent.  This leads to the suspicion that a              
              family of carriers may be involved.  Dr. Herbig's research will                
              address this very vexing problem in astronomy.
