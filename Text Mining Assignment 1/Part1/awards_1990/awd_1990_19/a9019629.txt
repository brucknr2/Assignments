Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The final goal of the research is to establish                                 
              spectrophotometric pH measurements as a key analysis in the                    
              study of the oceanic carbon dioxide system.  The bulk of the                   
              work will be focussed on calibrating the dyes for use as pH                    
              indicators by direct reference to measurements using the highly                
              reproducible hydrogen / silver-silver chloride cell.                           
              Additional work will be performed to assess the stability of                   
              the indicator dyes and the importance of impurities in                         
              commercially available chemicals.  Experiments will also be                    
              conducted to demonstrate that these pH measurements are                        
              thermodynamically consistent with measurements of dissolved                    
              inorganic carbon, total alkalinity, and f(CO2).  Furthermore,                  
              an additional pH buffer for use in the electrometric                           
              measurement of oceanic pH, will be established.  Detailed and                  
              precise pH profiles will be obtained in the North Pacific Ocean                
              in conjunction with the CO2 system measurements of NOAA                        
              personnel.  The proposed work entails measurements of                          
              spectrophotometric pH on each seawater sample analyzed by NOAA                 
              personnel for total inorganic carbon, CO2 partial pressure, and                
              total alkalinity.  These measurements will be used to assist in                
              long term NOAA investigations of oceanic-atmospheric CO2                       
              exchange and will also be used to verify the accuracy of pH                    
              determinations involving indicator dyes by demonstrating                       
              internal consistency in alkalinity, total CO2, pCO2 and pH data                
              sets.
