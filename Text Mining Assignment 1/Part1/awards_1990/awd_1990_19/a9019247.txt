Abstract    :
              Major progress has been made with respect to our                               
              understanding of the tectonic evolution of the Antarctic                       
              Plate.  Paleomagnetic data, marine magnetic anomaly                            
              identifications, Geosat-derived tectonic lineations, heat                      
              flow derived seafloor ages and mathematical solutions for                      
              plate motions around triple junctions have all contributed                     
              to a better model for the tectonic evolution of the circum-                    
              Antarctic region.  Even so, major problems still exist with                    
              respect to the Mesozoic to Recent tectonic evolution of the                    
              Antarctic continental margin which can be tackled using heat                   
              flow measurements.  This award supports the study of a                         
              tectonic problem that heat flow can address, the                               
              determination of the age of the Powell Basin at the end of                     
              the West Antarctic Peninsula and its relationship to the                       
              opening of Drake's Passage.                                                    
                                                                                             
              Specifically, heat flow measurement will be used to study                      
              the age and mode of crustal extension of the Powell Basin,                     
              where standard age determination fails and heat flow is the                    
              only method that can be used to date its opening.
