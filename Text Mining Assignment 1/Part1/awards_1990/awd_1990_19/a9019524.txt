Abstract    :
                   Precise laser spectroscopy of H2 and atomic helium is                     
              carried out to determine fundamental physical properties of these              
              systems and to investigate their excited state dynamics.  Studies              
              include (1) molecular states very near the dissociation limits,                
              (2) attainable limits in far-UV spectroscopy, (3) measurement of               
              the two-photon 11S-21S interval in atomic helium, (4) the Stark                
              effect in molecular Rydberg states, and (5) predissociation and                
              autoionization in small molecules.
