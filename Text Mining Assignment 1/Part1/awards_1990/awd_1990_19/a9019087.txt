Abstract    :
                   The PI will continue efforts to model the elastic and                     
              thermodynamic properties ofsolid and liquid silicate and oxide                 
              minerals at extreme pressure and temperature conditions.  He is                
              developing an electron gas theory of bonding that yields                       
              quantitatively accurate thermodynamic properties, and accurately               
              predicts phase transformations in cubic minerals. He will apply                
              this model to more complex mantyle minerals, and develop a                     
              parameterized version of potentials for geologically important                 
              iron paris.
