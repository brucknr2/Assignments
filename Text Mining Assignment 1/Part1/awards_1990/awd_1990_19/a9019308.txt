Abstract    :
              The Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Science will continue to                      
              operate its Flow Cytometry Facility.  The overall Facility                     
              goals are to provide modern instrumentation for                                
              quantification of marine particles and cells, to provide                       
              space and technical expertise for visiting researchers, and                    
              support for sample and data analysis.  Funding will provide                    
              salary for a technician, maintenance contracts, travel and                     
              expenses for the advisory committee, and a new                                 
              epifluorescence microscope.  Part time support for the                         
              Facility's director is also provided.  The Marine Cytometry                    
              Facility will be closely linked to the existing Phytoplankton                  
              Culture Collection Facility at Bigelow.
