Abstract    :
              The general goals of this research are to determine the geometric              
              structure of surfaces, in particular reconstructed surfaces.  This             
              work provides a deeper and wider understanding of the factors that             
              affect atomic positions at interfaces and to use this knowledge to             
              artificially produce surfaces with interesting and potentially                 
              useful properties.  Some of the issues that will be addressed                  
              include:  1) the influence of external perturbations, like steps               
              and adatoms of different electronegativity, on reconstruction                  
              phenomena; 2) what are the microscopic factors that cause influence            
              bilayer growth?; what new insights can be obtained about the                   
              vibrational properties at a surface?  The principal experimental               
              technique to be employed is medium energy ion scattering.
