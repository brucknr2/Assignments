Abstract    :
                   Nutrient limitation of algal growth provokes changes in the               
              biochemical composition of the cells.  This in turn affects the                
              quality of algae as food for upper trophic levels.  Models of the              
              dynamics of the interaction of herbivores and their food thus                  
              should include such food quality effects.  This research will                  
              explore the ways in which algal growth rate changes food quality.              
              Laboratory demography studies of the freshwater cladoceran,                    
              Daphnia pulex, feeding on variously limited unialgal and multi-                
              algal foods will be undertaken.  These studies will ascertain the              
              relationship between growth rate and quality in simple systems.                
              In addition, food quality effects in natural populations will be               
              examined through a set of experiments and measurements including               
              1. assessment of nature and degree of nutrient limitation in                   
              algal populations, 2. assessment of degree of food limitation in               
              zooplankton populations, 3. measurement of assimilation                        
              efficiency of N and P in zooplankton.  These data will then be                 
              used to explore in theoretical models how the stability and                    
              tendency for coexistence of herbivore and algae is influenced by               
              food quality effects.  Results will contribute to the conceptual               
              basis of limnology and will add to the information base for                    
              managing aquatic resources.
