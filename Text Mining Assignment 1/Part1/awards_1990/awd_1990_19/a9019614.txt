Abstract    :
              Dr. Gregory Voth is supported by a grant from the Theoretical                  
              and Computational Chemistry Program to perform theoretical                     
              studies of quantum mechanical activated rate processes in                      
              complex systems.  This work provides an important theoretical                  
              background for understanding the energetics of chemical                        
              reactions which occur in solution.                                             
                                                                                             
              Dr. Voth's research will be directed at developing a theory for                
              the transmission coefficient which accounts for the additional                 
              tunneling and multidimensional dynamical effects which can                     
              influence the value of the quantum rate constant.  The quantum                 
              rate theory will be applied to the study of proton transfer                    
              reactions in condensed phases and to thereby obtain a better                   
              understanding of the influence of solvent polarization free                    
              energetics, intramolecular motions, and isotopic substitution                  
              on the value of the rate constant.  The theory will also be                    
              used to examine the fundamental role of nonlinearity in                        
              condensed phase quantum activated rate processes.
