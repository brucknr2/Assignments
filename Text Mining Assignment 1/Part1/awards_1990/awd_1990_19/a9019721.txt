Abstract    :
              An outstanding problem in tectonics is the nature and timing of                
              extensional collapse of previously thickened crust in orogenic                 
              belts.  This proposal is to date structural features attributed to             
              the extensional collapse of the Caledonian orogen in southwest                 
              Norway.  Structural features to be dated include:  uplifted high-              
              pressure eclogite rocks; retrograde, amphibolite facies meta-                  
              morphism, and; major, km-thick mylonite zones, some of which are               
              at greenschist grade.  High-precision data will be obtained using              
              the 40Ar/39Ar dating method and will allow comparison of uplift ages           
              among different areas.  Collaboration with local geologists from               
              the University of Olso will ensure that the data are obtained with             
              good structural control.  The combination of well-known local                  
              geology and excellent exposure in SW Norway, with high-precision               
              ages and testable tectonic models, will significantly improve the              
              understanding of orogenic collapse processes.
