Abstract    :
              We propose to apply a molecular and genetic approach to identify               
              the genes that function in a signal transduction pathway that                  
              regulates a gene critical for development.  The transcriptional                
              regulation of the cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase in the early             
              development of Dictyostelium discoideum will be investigated                   
              through the analysis of existing and new regulatory mutations.  The            
              following approaches will be pursued.  1) The defects in two pds A             
              mutations that specifically alter regulation of the                            
              phosphodiesterase will be identified.  2) We will develop a suicide            
              selection method that utilizes extrachromosomal shuttle vectors to             
              isolate new regulatory mutations that are specific for the                     
              phosphodiesterase gene.  3) Genetic complementation analysis will              
              be performed with the new and existing mutations to elucidate the              
              activities involved in the developmental regulation of the                     
              phosphodiesterase gene.                                                        
                                                                                             
              Our approach should complement the work of others studying                     
              receptor-mediated events of signal transduction to identify                    
              molecules that link the members of a signal transduction chain into            
              a pathway from the cell surface to the nucleus.   //
