Abstract    :
                   Basic theoretical work on atomic scattering processes                     
              will be performed.  The topics to be studied are:                              
                   1.  Variational approximations for scattering in a laser                  
                       field.                                                                
                   2.  Infrared corrections to  scattering cross sections                    
                   3.  The role of various reactions involving hydrogen in                   
                       galaxy formation.                                                     
                   4.  Semi-classical studies of atomic interactions                         
                   5.  Retarded interactions and their relationship to QED.                  
                   6.  Variational bounds.                                                   
                   7.  Conditions for the non-existence of bound states.
