Abstract    :
              Methods developed by using higher order Taylor polynomial, as well as          
              those obtained by taking a generalized predictor-corrector approach,           
              will be studied for solving linear programs.  Efficient methods for            
              solving structured linear programs will be developed.  Methods for             
              finding vertex solution within the framework of interior point methods         
              will be investigated.  Approaches will be pursued to extend the                
              research to parallel methods and to convex problems.
