Abstract    :
                   Preserved plant and animal specimens in natural history                   
              museums and herbariums are critical resources for biological                   
              research.  Systematists, ecologists, biogeographers, and                       
              investigators from many other fields rely on these specimens and               
              the data associated with them.  Most specimens are accompanied by              
              information concerning their geographic location, but most                     
              commonly these locality data are in the form of narrative                      
              descriptions, rather than standardized map coordinates such as                 
              latitude and longitude.  Dr. Matthew McGranaghan, a geographer,                
              proposes to develop new computer software that will use an expert              
              system approach to interpreting these text-based locality                      
              descriptions into map coordinates.  The software will call on                  
              electronic gazetteers and digitized maps that are currently                    
              available.  The proposed software will be tested on label data                 
              from the plant collections in the Bishop Museum of Natural                     
              History of Hawaii.                                                             
                   Biologists are keenly interested in understanding the                     
              geographic distributions of organisms, but it is prohibitively                 
              time-consuming to plot individual specimens on maps.  The                      
              proposed software development effort has the potential to make                 
              hundreds of millions of museum specimens readily available to                  
              researchers working on problems of geographic distribution.  This              
              effort will have wide impact in the museum research community, in              
              geography and regional sciences, and in the development of                     
              artificial intelligence applications in biology.
