Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              The investigator proposes to assess the effects of                             
              substituent and solvent variations on proton transfer                          
              reactions of organic molecules.  For appropriately                             
              substituted amines and carboxylic acids, he will conduct                       
              proton transfer equilibrium measurements in selected                           
              solvents.  Recently developed substituent parameters                           
              (resonance, field/inductive and polarizability) will be                        
              used to identify, quantify and analyze substituent effects                     
              on the basicities and acidities of these molecules in                          
              various solvents.  Comparison with reported gas phase                          
              basicities and acidities will allow solvent attenuation                        
              factors (SAF) to be determined.  The SAF values will                           
              provide detailed insight into solvation effects on each                        
              species involved in the proton transfer reactions.                             
              Attention will then be focused upon the structurally more                      
              complicated alpha-amino acids which possess both amino and                     
              carboxyl functional groups in a single molecule.                               
              Substituent and medium effects on the acidity and basicity                     
              of substituted alpha-amino acids will then be evaluated in                     
              terms of the information gained regarding substituent and                      
              medium effects on the basicity of substituted amines and                       
              the acidity of substituted carboxylic acids.
