Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A coupled binuclear non-heme iron active site exists in a                      
              variety of proteins which perform different biological                         
              functions.  hemerythrin (Hr) binds O2, methane monooxygenase                   
              activates it for hydroxylation, reducted ribonucleotide                        
              reductase reacts with O2 to generate a catalytically active                    
              tyrosyl radical, and reduced purple acid phosphatase is                        
              oxidatively inactivated in the presence of phosphate.  These                   
              protein sites (and analogous model complexes) can be obtained                  
              in three oxidation states.  Dr. Solomon's spectral studies on                  
              these sites and their substrate and small molecule bound forms                 
              emphasize bsorption, circular dichrosims, and magnetic circular                
              dichroism (MCD) to probe the excited states, and variable-                     
              temperature, variable-field MCD to probe ground state sublevel                 
              splittings.  This data enables a determination of the geometry                 
              of each iron, and the exchange coupling which is associated                    
              with bridging ligation.  The goal of this research is to define                
              active site geometric and electronic structural diffeences                     
              which correlate with variation in biological reactivity.
