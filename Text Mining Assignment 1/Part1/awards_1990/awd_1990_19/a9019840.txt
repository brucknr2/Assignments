Abstract    :
              In this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and                            
              Organometallic Program of the Chemistry Division, Gould will                   
              study the mechanisms of oxidation-reduction reactions in                       
              solution.  Emphasis will be placed on the participation of less                
              usual oxidation states.  One of the important foundations of                   
              chemical thinking is a broad knowledge of the behavior of the                  
              oxidation states of the elements.                                              
                                                                                             
              Three general areas will be investigated: 1) intramolecular                    
              ligand-to-metal hydride migrations, resulting in two-electron                  
              reductions of the metal center; 2) redox chemistry of                          
              stabilized chromium(IV), particularly the noncomplementary                     
              reactions in which chromium(III) is formed through the use of                  
              two-electron reducing agents; and 3) redox chemistry of                        
              molybdenum(III) and -(IV).  Attempts will be made to                           
              differentiate one- and two-electron oxidations of these states;                
              evidence for ligand bridging will be sought.  The data obtained                
              should allow estimates for rates of electron self-exchange                     
              pertaining to these systems.
