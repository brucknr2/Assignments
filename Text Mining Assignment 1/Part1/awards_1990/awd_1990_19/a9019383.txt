Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal is for the continuation of research on transformation            
              toughening in ZrO2-containig ceramics. Specifically, the research              
              will focus on i) making dense transformation toughened Mg-PSZ with             
              fine grain size, in contrast to the current generation of tough Mg-            
              PSZ's which are course grained, porous, and contain unwanted second            
              phases, ii)studying structure-property relationships in ternary Mg,            
              Y-PSZ's, particularly probing the effect of particle morphology and            
              hence coherency stresses, on the crack tip stress-induced                      
              transformation, iii) Studying the mechanics of stress-induced                  
              subcritical transformation which in "supertough" Mg-PSZ can occur              
              before any visible surface microcracks, and iv) studying                       
              transformation around microhardness indents in Y-PSZ single                    
              crystals, particularly the dislocation-nucleated autocatalytic                 
              transformation.
