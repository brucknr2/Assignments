Abstract    :
              This award provides for three year's support to establish a time               
              series of abundance and spatial pattern of pelagic birds in the                
              California Current System (CCS).  The study involves a sampling                
              regime that has been operational for 40 years and is already                   
              funded by other agencies: the cruises of the California                        
              Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI). Data has               
              already been collected for birds on 12 sequential CalCOFI                      
              cruises (four per year) beginning in May 1987.  Thus, the study                
              will yield a continuous time series of six years length. The                   
              intent is to continue the project for a much longer time. This                 
              inexpensive project provides an ideal opportunity to study                     
              spatial and temporal variation of bird populations at a range of               
              spatial scales meaningful to their life histories. The primary                 
              objectives are to calculate a mean and variance in time and space              
              of bird abundance and dispersion based on the time series                      
              collected between 1987-1993.  Once the long-term patterns have                 
              been determined, the magnitude of variation at different temporal              
              scales will be examined. Long term patterns of bird abundance                  
              which emerge will be compared to patterns in the physical and                  
              biological data collected simultaneously on the cruises.
