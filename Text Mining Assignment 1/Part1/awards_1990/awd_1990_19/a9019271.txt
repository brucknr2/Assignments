Abstract    :
              Photosystem II contains at least 10 polypeptides,                              
              approximately 50% of the total number of known plant                           
              photosystem II polypeptides, with molecular weights of under                   
              10,000 whose function is mostly unknown.  Some have been                       
              shown to be encoded by small open reading frames in                            
              chloroplast DNA.  Still other small open reading frames                        
              encode putative membrane polypeptides speculated to be                         
              additional photosystem III components.  The aim of the                         
              proposal is to use techniques of specific mutagenesis to                       
              delete the complementary genes from the cyanobacterial                         
              chromosome.  Because of the similarity of photosystem II                       
              complexes from plants ad cyanobacteria this will provide a                     
              rapid method to assess the function of the small polypeptides                  
              in photosystem II.  Site directed mutagenesis will then be                     
              used to determine the role of specific amino acids, or                         
              specific regions of the polypeptides, in photosystem II                        
              assembly and function.  Antisera will be raised against                        
              synthetic polypeptides matching the products of the open                       
              reading frames and used to identify the products in plant                      
              photosystem II core preparations.  The impact of mutations on                  
              photosystem II function and assembly will be studied using a                   
              range of techniques including chlorophyll fluorescence                         
              emission spectroscopy, oxygen polarography, rapid absorption                   
              spectroscopy, and western and northern blotting.
