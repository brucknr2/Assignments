Abstract    :
                   This grant provides partial support for the Tenth                         
              International Symposium on Environmental Biogeochemistry.  The                 
              International Symposia for Environmental Biogeochemistry, (ISEB)               
              is an organization devoted to the advancement of the science of                
              biogeochemistry and to its influence on the global environment.                
              The goal of the ISEB is to disseminate scientific findings in                  
              biogeochemistry to the international scientific community,                     
              thereby fostering interdisciplinary communication and research                 
              among scientists around the globe.  The field of environmental                 
              biogeochemistry is broad and encompasses a diversity of                        
              disciplines.  The Tenth International Symposia is to be held 21-               
              24, August, 1991 in San Francisco and will have a focused theme,               
              namely that of "Global Change and the Biogeochemistry of                       
              Radiative Trace Gases."  This topic is of great concern to the                 
              international scientific community, as well as to the respective               
              governments.
