Abstract    :
              The program at City College of the City University of New York                 
              builds on an established base of female and minority bachelor's and            
              master's degree engineering students and on successful programs for            
              recruitment and retention to establish a new program of doctoral,              
              graduate study and research traineeships for underrepresented                  
              students.  The program is entitled project FORCE (Focused                      
              Opportunities For Research Careers in Engineering).  FORCE involves            
              specially selected faculty research mentors from each of the                   
              engineering departments.  The four student participants                        
              will receive special advising, counseling and other support                    
              services designed to improve their retention in the program and                
              enhance their potential for a successful research career.  They                
              will have a mandatory internship experience in industry during the             
              summer prior to their matriculation as graduate students.                      
              Subsequent summer internships will be optional.
