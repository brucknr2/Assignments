Abstract    :
              The purpose of this research is to develop a                                   
              methodology combining the use of artificial neural                             
              networks and genetic algorithms in order to solve                              
              the power network transaction problem.  The                                    
              reason for doing this is that the current analysis                             
              methods do not accurately model load flow                                      
              constraints on the system.  Successful completion of                           
              this research will advance the operational                                     
              capabilities of electric utilities.
