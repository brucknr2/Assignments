Abstract    :
              In soils, fertilizer ammonia is oxidized to nitrite (NH3 +1.502 -              
              >HNO2 +H2O) by the chemoautotrophic nitrifying bacterium                       
              Nitrosomonas europaea. Nitrite is oxidized by Nitrobacter to                   
              nitrate, a primary source of N for food protein in non-leguminous              
              crops.  Thus the initial transformation of most food nitrogen is               
              carried out by Nitrosomonas.  Of great economic importance is                  
              loss of N in soils as N-gases produced by Nitrosomonas during                  
              oxidation of NH3 or by reduction of nitrate by denitrifying                    
              bacteria.  Control of agricultural loss by denitrification is                  
              attempted by the use of inhibitors of ammonia oxidation by                     
              Nitrosomonas.  This lends significance to improved knowledge of                
              the mechanism of oxidation of ammonia to nitrite.                              
                                                                                             
              NH3 is oxygenated by O2 to NH2OH which is then oxidized (NH2OH                 
              +H2O)-> HNO2 + 4e- +4H+) by the enzyme hydroxylamine                           
              oxidoreductase "HAO".  HAO is a large and unusually complex                    
              hemoprotein (7 c-hemes and 1 substrate binding "P460" group per                
              60,000 MW protein).  Four electron pass from HAO to a tetraheme                
              cytochrome c-554. Two electrons then pass to a membrane electron               
              transfer chain and finally to a terminal oxidase, producing                    
              water.  Two additional electrons pass from cytochrome c-554 in a               
              separate electron transfer chain to the ammonia oxidizing                      
              reaction.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              Goals of the project include an analysis of the enzyme HAO, the                
              cytochrome c-554 and the electron transport chain to dioxygen.                 
              They intend to determine the structure of the two proteins.                    
              Particular attention will be paid to the active site of HAO.  The              
              mechanism of turnover in the active site and electron transfer                 
              from active site to HAO hemes and then hemes of cytochrome c-554               
              will be pursued.  The approach involves protein purification,                  
              optical spectroscopy, peptide analysis, DNA sequencing, kinetics,              
              suicide substrates, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy,              
              Mossbauer spectroscopy and X-ray crystallographic analysis.
