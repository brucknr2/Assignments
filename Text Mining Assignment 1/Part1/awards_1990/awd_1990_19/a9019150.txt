Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              This award supports the continuation of a long term study of the               
              stat formation properties of nearby galaxies, with special emphasis            
              on those observations which are most relevant to understanding                 
              galactic evolution.  Dr. Kennicutt is one of the world leaders in              
              this field of endeavor, and his investigations will include studies            
              of how the rate of formation of massive stars relates to the                   
              physical properties of the interstellar medium.  He will also                  
              investigate the properties of HII regions in a variety of galaxies,            
              to study the influence of variations in extinction and the stellar             
              initial mass function.
