Abstract    :
                   Emanuel proposes a three-part study of tropical cyclone                   
              dynamics: a) A field experiment, to test a simple hypothesis that              
              tropical cloud clusters are "triggered" to "ignition" (cyclogen-               
              esis) only if the mid-tropospheric source air for small-scale                  
              convective downdrafts in the vicinity of the disturbance's                     
              center becomes warm/moist enough to set up a downdraft-surface                 
              layer-cloud updraft cycle that results in a continually warmer                 
              and/or moister downdraft source layer. The field experiment is                 
              required because neither conventional past observations nor                    
              numerical models resolve the spatial or temporal detail needed to              
              test the hypothesis.  b) A set of analyses of past hurricanes to               
              see whether cyclone initiation is also accompanied by the                      
              approach of an upper-level flow system with  a locally high                    
              measure of combined cyclonic rotation and thermal instability, so              
              that it lines up over a similar low-level area generated by                    
              clusters of tropical rain showers c) Generalization of the                     
              current  barotropic (one-layer) theory of steering of mature                   
              hurricanes by the ambient large scale flow, by constructing a                  
              simple two-layer (baroclinic) model. Although it has consistently              
              been observed that the vertical shear of the ambient flow of                   
              tropical cyclones is weak at best, Emanuel argues that the                     
              cyclones themselves have pronounced vertical structure, with the               
              lower tropospheric cyclone overlain by a more anticyclonic vorti-              
              city center.                                                                   
                   The third study will improve our understanding of the                     
              factors governing hurricane movement. The first two should                     
              provide more information on the perennial question as to why so                
              few tropical oceanic rain systems eventually develop into mature               
              tropical cyclones.
