Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This dissertation research award will allow a cultural                         
              anthropologist from the University of Kentucky to study how new                
              economic opportunities to sell cash crops affect the patterns of               
              authority in the households of Venezuelan peasants.  The methods               
              to be used include structured sample interviews and participant                
              observation, to test hypotheses concerning the decrease in rural-              
              urban migration, increase in male control over economic                        
              resources, and increase in economic incentives offered to younger              
              household members to keep them on the farm.                                    
                                                                                             
              This research is important because peasant households throughout               
              the world are shifting from a subsistence to a cash-crop                       
              livelihood, with attendant changes in household structure and                  
              function.  Increased understanding of how households react to                  
              specific incentives can help us design programs to ameliorate                  
              problems of deteriorating social control in rural families and                 
              excessive rural-urban migration.
