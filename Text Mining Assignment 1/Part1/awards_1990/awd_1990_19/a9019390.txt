Abstract    :
              The Southern Ocean will never be adequately understood without                 
              knowing the reasons why major nutrients never go to depletion in               
              offshore, open-ocean waters.  Dr. Martin proposes to test the                  
              hypothesis that phytoplankton productivity in the Southern Ocean               
              varies in direct relation to iron availability.  Samples to test               
              this hypothesis were collected in the open-ocean waters of the                 
              Drake Passage in March/April 1989 and in the Ross Sea in                       
              January/February 1990.  Initial results suggest that iron                      
              deficiency is the primary reason that the phytoplankton fail to                
              bloom and use up major nutrients in offshore Southern Ocean waters.            
              Renewed funding for one year to support our continued analysis of              
              samples and testing of the iron deficiency hypothesis is requested             
              in this proposal.
