Abstract    :
              This award will support the research of Dr. Tarek Sammakia at                  
              the University of Colorado at Boulder. The award is the starter                
              grant portion of Dr. Sammakia's Postdoctoral Research                          
              Fellowship in Chemistry and deals with the design, synthesis,                  
              and reactivity of chiral Lewis acids and chiral silane                         
              reagents.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              Stable alpha-ferrocenyl Lewis acid carbocations will be                        
              synthesized which have a chiral center below the face of the                   
              reactive carbonium center. These reactive intermediates will be                
              evaluated as the stereogenic centers in aldol condensations,                   
              Michael addition reactions and Diels-Alder reactions. The                      
              ferrocene template will also be used to synthesize chiral                      
              ferrocenyl silanes which will be tested in the asymmetric                      
              reduction of ketones.
