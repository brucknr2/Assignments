Abstract    :
                   This proposal is to continue studying the morphology,                     
              dynamics, and temporal variability of the tropical ionosphere and              
              thermosphere, and to extend the investigation to higher                        
              latitudes.  Atmosphere Explorer satellite measurements of airglow              
              emission intensities, particle densities and temperatures will be              
              employed in conjunction with the NCAR TIGCM in order to improve                
              the understanding of the basic mechanisms which govern the                     
              behavior of the upper atmosphere.  The observational data will be              
              compared with model predictions in an investigation of solar                   
              tides and neutral winds in the thermosphere.  A study of the                   
              distribution of Mg+ ions should yield important new information                
              on ionospheric plasma transport processes.  In addition, the AE                
              data base will provide the unique opportunity to develop global                
              empirical and semi-empirical models of the major thermospheric                 
              airglow emissions.
