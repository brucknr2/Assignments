Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Insects must periodically secrete a new cuticular exoskeleton and              
              shed the old confining one to complete development to the adult                
              stage.  Tanning or sclerotization of the new cuticle with                      
              catecholamine metabolites, hardens selected regions of the                     
              exoskeleton for protection, locomotion and a diversity of other                
              vital functions.  This project focuses on identifying the                      
              reactive catecholamine metabolites or tanning agents and                       
              determining how they interact with the structural polymers of                  
              protein and chitin to form the hardened exoskeleton.  The new                  
              non-destructive technique of solid-state NMR is being used to                  
              determine how the structural molecules are linked together by                  
              catecholamine metabolites to produce a cuticle with unique                     
              mechanical properties.  The PIs also are characterizing the                    
              enzymes that are necessary for regulating cuticle tanning and the              
              action of potential enzyme inhibitors of the process.  The                     
              disruption of any step in the sequence can block further                       
              development and consequently may provide highly selective                      
              approaches to insect pest control.//
