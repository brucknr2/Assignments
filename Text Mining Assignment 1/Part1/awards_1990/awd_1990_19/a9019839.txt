Abstract    :
                   This grant is for research in basic magnetospheric plasma                 
              physics and the nature of the aurora.  In particular, the role of              
              magnetic pulsations for the injection and removal of outer zone                
              trapped Van Allen belt electrons will be studied.  Observations                
              of the pulsation phase of low-latitude auroral events during the               
              maximum of solar cycle 22 using high sensitivity photometers and               
              correlated data at Minneapolis will be continued and expanded by               
              adding low-light-level TV images to the data set to produce                    
              permanent images of the pulsating forms.  These pulsations begin               
              at auroral breakup and often continue for many hours into the                  
              morning.  This interaction is thought to be due to the                         
              interaction of Van Allen outer zone electron with cold plasma                  
              producting instabilities and precipitation.
