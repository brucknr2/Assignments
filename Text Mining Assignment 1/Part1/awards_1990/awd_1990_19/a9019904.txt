Abstract    :
              Paleoclimatic data from ice cores will likely prove to be a                    
              principal test by which many aspects of Global Change are                      
              evaluated.  Deep ice cores from polar regions provide key                      
              paleoclimate data sets because they bridge the time scale                      
              gap between records with annual resolution, but relatively                     
              short time scales (e.g. tree rings), and those which have a                    
              resolution of hundreds to thousands of years (e.g. marine                      
              sediments).                                                                    
                                                                                             
              This award provides for the efficient and timely access to                     
              ice core data as they become available, as well as provides                    
              for the safe, long-term, archival of key data for the                          
              Greenland Ice Sheet Project (GISP2).  The National Snow and                    
              Ice Data Center (NSIDC) will provide data management and                       
              archiving services to ensure efficient and centralized                         
              access to the total data set and the permanent retention of                    
              key data.  Because of the widespread and increasing interest                   
              in paleoclimate and global change these data sets will be                      
              used not only by GISP2 but there will be an ever increasing                    
              demand from fields outside glaciology for this type off                        
              data.
