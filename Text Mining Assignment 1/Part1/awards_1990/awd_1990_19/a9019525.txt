Abstract    :
              The research is concerned with the properties of acoustic phonons              
              in thin films.  This knowledge is essential for the unambiguous                
              interpretation of non-equilibrium measurements of these systems.               
              The objective is to obtain a more complete knowledge of phonon                 
              dimensionality, occupation number, and transmission between                    
              dissimilar solids.  The experimental techniques to be employed                 
              combine magnetoresistance and electron heating experiments with                
              phonon spectroscopy in the study of novel structures in which the              
              phonon properties can be modified in situ.  The research will also             
              be broadened to the investigation of acoutic attenuation in                    
              disordered metal films.  Films with contacts and connections for               
              precision resistivity measurements will be fabricated inside novel             
              acoutic cavities permitting the simultaneous measurement of sound              
              attenuation and electrical properties.
