Abstract    :
                   This award provides 60% funding for the acquisition of a                  
              combined atomic force and scanning tunneling microscope system that            
              will be installed and operated in the Beckman Institute Materials              
              Resource Center at the California Institute of Technology. Funding             
              from the National Science Foundation will be shared equally between            
              the divisions of Chemistry and Earth Sciences. Caltech is committed            
              to providing the remaining 40% funding required.                               
                   The microscope system will be capable of imaging surface                  
              topography of materials at the resolution of individual atoms. It              
              will be applied in a large number of research projects at Caltech              
              where surface analysis is critical; for example the interaction of             
              aqueous species at solid-liquid interfaces.
