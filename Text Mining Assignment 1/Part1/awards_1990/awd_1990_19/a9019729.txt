Abstract    :
              Scripps Institution of Oceanography will upgrade a suite of                    
              bottom mounted electromagnetic field sensors and bottom                        
              pressure gauges developed by Jean Filloux and his group.                       
              These prototype instruments have been used in both                             
              oceanographic and geophysical investigations.  Their                           
              modernization will enhance the instruments' reliability for                    
              future research applications.  The upgrades will incorporate                   
              advances in electronics and materials which have occurred                      
              over the past years.  Modern data storage capabilities will                    
              be added and acoustic releases will be mounted allowing long-                  
              term deployments for up to 24 months.  Incorporation of new                    
              ceramic materials and electronics will also increase the                       
              reliability and stability of the sensors.  The upgrades                        
              acknowledge the importance of EM measurements as a component                   
              of future ocean science investigations including the Global                    
              Geoscience initiatives.
