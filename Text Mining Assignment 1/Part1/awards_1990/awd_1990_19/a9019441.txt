Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              The Quaternary Southern Volcanic Zone (SVZ) of the Chilean Andes               
              has been investigated by teams of US scientists concerned with                 
              quantifying the mantle source components in arc parent magmas, and             
              the degree to which these magmas have interacted with arc crust.               
              Longitudinal variations in crustal age, thickness, and the age of              
              the subducted plate make this an ideal target for regional studies.            
                                                                                             
              The primary focus of this project is an exceptionally detailed and             
              comprehensive investigation of Tatara-San Pedro (TSP) (36o S), the             
              youngest edifice (ca. 150ka to Holocene) of the San Pedro-Pellado              
              volcanic complex.  This study will be grounded on a wealth of                  
              regional information concerning along-strike and across strike                 
              variations in Quaternary activity.                                             
                                                                                             
              In addition to its compositional variability, TSP is exceptionally             
              well exposed from its base: 1 km vertical (or composite) sections              
              (up to 150 flows) are exposed in deep glacial canyons from all                 
              quadrants of the cone.  These sections will be sampled on a 100%               
              flow-by-flow basis (chemistry and paleomagnetism) in conjunction               
              with sampling of abundant crustal xenoliths, lateral sampling of               
              select Pleistocene lavas, and detailed surface sampling of two                 
              spectacularly heterogeneous Holocene flows.  A detailed                        
              reconstruction of the eruptive history of TSP will be made by                  
              correlating among these sections through integration of                        
              paleosecular magnetic variation data, physical stratigraphy,                   
              geochemistry and petrography, and high-resolution geochronology.
