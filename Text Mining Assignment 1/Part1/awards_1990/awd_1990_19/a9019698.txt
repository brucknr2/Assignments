Abstract    :
              This award supports cooperative research in                                    
              applied mathematics to be conducted by Jim                                     
              Douglas of Purdue University and Paulo Jorge S.                                
              Paes Leme of the Polytechnic Institute of Rio de                               
              Janeiro, Brazil. The objective of the project is                               
              to mode., analyze and design numerical methods                                 
              for the simulation of multiphase flow in a                                     
              naturally fractured porous medium.  The                                        
              introduction of an appropriate system of                                       
              differential equations with proper boundary                                    
              conditions have recently improved various aspects                              
              of such flow.  For single and two-phase flow this                              
              will lead to a better description of the                                       
              interaction between fluids in fractures and in                                 
              porous rock.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              A further goal of this work is to extend this                                  
              approach to other flows where the effect of                                    
              compressibility, as well and the interchange of                                
              mass between phases is considered.  Also, another                              
              objective is the study of macroscopic properties                               
              of the parameters of these models from                                         
              microstructural analysis.  This award will allow                               
              continuation of a productive U.S.-Brazil                                       
              collaboration.
