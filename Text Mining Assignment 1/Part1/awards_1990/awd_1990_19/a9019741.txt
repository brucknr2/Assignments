Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This is a statistical study of abyssal hill morphology on                 
              the East Pacific Rise at 7.7 to 9.3S. Two days of ship time                    
              will be added to a cruise to gather abyssal hill bathymetric                   
              and sub-bathymetric data along flow lines west of the ridge                    
              axis. The data will be analyzed to investigate correlations                    
              between the variation in abyssal hill characteristics and the                  
              variation in morphology and associated geophysical processes.                  
              The Principal Investigator has generated a two-dimensional                     
              model for seafloor characterization and a method for estimating                
              model parameters from multibeam bathymetric data. The model                    
              parameters provide quantitative physical information regarding                 
              abyssal hills, describing their rms height, characteristic                     
              width and length, aspect ratio.asimuth of lineation, and                       
              fractral height, dimension.
