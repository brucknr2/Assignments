Abstract    :
                   The objective of the proposed research is to extend the                   
              University of Denver atlas of high resolution (0.002 cm-1)                     
              infrared solar absorption stratospheric spectra and the                        
              corresponding laboratory studies initiated under previous NSF                  
              grants.                                                                        
                   The currently published 0.002 cm-1 stratospheric atlas                    
              covers the intervals 800-810 cm-1, 934-960 cm-1, 992-1002 cm-1                 
              and 1240-1260 cm-1.  The major objectives of the proposed                      
              research are:  1) to extend the 0.002 cm-1 resolution atlases                  
              over additional intervals in the 2.5-30     region, mostly with                
              solar and laboratory spectra already obtained, and new spectra                 
              anticipated to be obtained in 1990-1992.  2) to extend the                     
              spectroscopic analysis of specific stratospheric molecules, such               
              as O3, HNO3, COF2 and others, from the laboratory and the                      
              stratospheric spectra.
