Abstract    :
                This research is proposed as an Accomplishment Based Renewal                 
              based on the strength of the past research of the proposer.                    
              Future work will continue to concentrate on the factors that                   
              control a major earthquake's size, location, and timing.  Using                
              plate tectonics as a framework, measurements will be made of the               
              depth extent and geometry of the seismogenic zone, i.e., that                  
              portion of the plate interface capable of generating large                     
              earthquakes.  The methodology developed to perform this                        
              measurement is innovatively flexible and powerful with rigorous                
              statistical error estimates.  Measurements will also concentrate               
              on the "inside" part of the earthquake where spatial                           
              heterogeneity in coupling strength along the fault controls many               
              features of seismicity and earthquake rupture processes.  This                 
              research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard                      
              Reduction Program.
