Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Potassium is the most abundant ion found in mammalian cells and                
              many cell functions are critically dependent on its concentration.             
              Indeed, too much or too little potassium in the blood can cause                
              changes in blood pressure and precipitate life threatening muscle              
              weakness and heart rhythm disturbances.  For these reasons, the                
              total amount of potassium in the body and its distribution in and              
              out of cells is very tightly regulated.  The kidney is the major               
              organ involved in the long term regulation of total amount of                  
              potassium in the body.  In many cells, including those of the                  
              kidney, potassium is transported via specialized protein structures            
              called ion channels.  In the kidney, nothing is known about the                
              structural properties and regulation of these proteins.  Using a               
              new and powerful research technique called the Polymerase Chain                
              Reaction (PCR) Dr. Desir and collaboration have been able to                   
              isolate parts of six genes which encode potassium channels in the              
              kidney.  He now proposes to further characterize these kidney genes            
              using the tools of molecular biology.  He will then examine the                
              mechanisms by which these proteins are regulated in the kidney.                
              These studies will make fundamental contributions to our                       
              understanding of the physiology and pathophysiology of potassium               
              transport in the kidney.//
