Abstract    :
                This research is a continuation of a study to investigate the                
              hypothesis that variations in normal stress across a fault                     
              surface are a primary factor controlling stick-slip behavior in                
              laboratory simulations and in earthquakes.  The hypothesis has                 
              been suggested on the basis of recent work on stick-slip behavior              
              in foam rubber and, if true, will have a major impact on current               
              ideas about rupture nucleation and the characteristics of                      
              premonitory slip.  The existence of normal vibrations during                   
              stick-slip has implications for rupture mechanics, fault                       
              behavior, and short-term earthquake prediction.  This research is              
              a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
