Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Pressing national concerns with global change and the mitigation               
              of natural hazards are leading to increased importance for                     
              research on the environments of the recent geological past.                    
              International collaboration has become essential for the analysis              
              of important scientific problems related to these issues.  This                
              project will support the participation of key U.S. researchers,                
              including new-career scholars, at the XIII Congress of the                     
              International Union for Quaternary Research (INQUA) in Beijing,                
              China, August 2-9, 1991.  Due to its strong multidisciplinary                  
              tradition, INQUA has direct relevance to seven programs within                 
              NSF. The scientific contacts achieved at this meeting and the                  
              related scientific field excursions will be invaluable for                     
              enhancing understanding of the dynamic earth system at a critical              
              point, when upon that understanding will depend the habitability               
              of the planet.  This project will provide the necessary support                
              for 32 U.S. Quaternary scientists to participate in this very                  
              significant international meeting.
