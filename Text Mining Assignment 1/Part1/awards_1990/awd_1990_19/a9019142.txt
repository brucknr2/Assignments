Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator and several colleagues will                    
              organize the interdisciplinary meeting entitled "Converging                    
              Approaches in Computational Biology".  The aim of this conference              
              will be to identify those computational tools common to several                
              disciplines and to facilitate an exchange among computational                  
              biologists in an interdisciplinary atmosphere.  The proposed                   
              meeting will bring together scientists working in a wide range of              
              disciplines (such as x-ray crystallography, electron microscopy,               
              sequence analysis, neurophysiological signal processing) with the              
              purpose of encouraging interdisciplinary exchange on underlying                
              concepts of mathematical modeling and techniques of numerical                  
              analysis in biology.
