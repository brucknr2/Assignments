Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              This award is in support of fundamental research into the                      
              astrophysics of ionized nebulae.  Dr. Ferland is one of the leading            
              investigators working on numerical simulations of radiative                    
              transfer in astrophysical plasmas, and his code has been used by               
              many astronomers to understand the physical conditions in                      
              astrophysical plasmas.  This research will extend his already                  
              powerful code in directions necessary for a fuller understanding               
              of the broad line regions of quasars.
