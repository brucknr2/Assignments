Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              It will be determined whether the central North sea was glaciated              
              and the rate and pattern of retreat of the Scandinavian ice sheet              
              form the northern North Sea will be determined by dating the                   
              first glacial marine sediments deposited upon submarine tills in               
              a series of in situ quality geotechnical bore holes. High                      
              resolution isotoped and faunal records will be developed from                  
              rapidly deposited postglacial sediments to monitor changes in                  
              meridional circulation and melt.water discharge at the centruy                 
              time scale. These studies will allow the evaluation of the                     
              relationship between glacier melting and changes in meridional                 
              circulation with unprecedented resolution and sensitivity.
