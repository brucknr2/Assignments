Abstract    :
              This special minority award will give Ph.D. student Edwin Melendez             
              additional flexibility in pursuing his graduate studies and                    
              research in economics.  This award will strengthen minority                    
              research participation in economics.  More specifically, the grant             
              will permit Melendez to study the youth labor market in 1988 using             
              the March 1988 Current Population Survey.                                      
                                                                                             
              Melendez will compare the labor force status of Hispanic, black and            
              white youth across 50 standard metropolitan statistical areas.  The            
              research will make a significant contribution to our understanding             
              of the factors that influence the labor supply and employment                  
              opportunities of black and Hispanic youth.  This is especially                 
              important because there has been little research on Hispanic youth             
              employment.  The research will also enhance the the graduate                   
              training of Melendez by developing and refining his research                   
              skills.  An important part of the project consists of learning the             
              necessary computer skills to access the data needed to conduct this            
              project.
