Abstract    :
              The production of humoral immune responses is dependent on                     
              antibody-producing B-cells which develop from precusor stem cells              
              that are present in the bone marrow.  Antigen-independent B-cell               
              differentiation involves a series of developmental stages                      
              (generally designated as pre-B cell stages) during which a                     
              sequential and ordered recombination of antibody genes occurs.                 
              Although the stages of pre-B cell differentiation have been fairly             
              well characterized, the control signals that regulate the                      
              progressive steps of pre-B cell maturation are not yet understood.             
              We have previously proposed that DNA recombination might play a                
              role in the initiation of lambda gene recombination in maturing                
              pre-B cells.  We now propose to directly test this hypothesis by               
              producing mice carrying a mutation that prevents the recombination             
              of RS DNA.  We will determine the physiological effect of this RS              
              mutation on B-cell maturation.                                                 
                                                                                             
              The results from this project have the potential to have a major               
              impact upon our understanding of the events which occur in the                 
              formation of active antibodies in mammals.
