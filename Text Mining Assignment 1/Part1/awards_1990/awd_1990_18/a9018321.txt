Abstract    :
                This research is to use modern techniques of waveform inversion              
              to determine both source parameters and travel times for all                   
              large to moderate-sized earthquakes that occurred deeper than 200              
              km in the Kuril-Kamchatka subduction zone in the past 25 years.                
              The resultant data will be used to invert for 3-D structure in                 
              the upper mantle and to investigate the stress directions in the               
              subducting slab.  The goal is to address the question of whether               
              the slab stops at the 670 km boundary or passes through into the               
              lower mantle, a significant question affecting models of earth                 
              dynamics and the chemical layering of the mantle.
