Abstract    :
              This conference concerns a Geochemical Society Symposium                       
              entitled: "Oxygen and carbon isotopes in Paleozoic and Early                   
              Mesozoic marine sediments: toward a global isotope stratigraphy",              
              to be convened Tuesday, October 30, 1990 in conjunction with the               
              National Geographic Society of American meeting in Dallas.  This               
              symposium directly addresses the goals of the NSF program on the               
              Geologic Record of Global Change.  The development and                         
              understanding of a global isotope stratigraphy requires good                   
              geographic coverage to separate the regional from the global                   
              signal.  This in turn requires international involvement.                      
              Furthermore, because of the qualitative techniques involved in                 
              distinguishing altered from unaltered specimens, international                 
              cooperation in sample and data exchange is vital.
