Abstract    :
                   The PIs propose to establish an embedded systems laboratory to be         
              used to support two new courses in the area of real-time systems and           
              applications.  Project funds will be used to purchase equipment and            
              software to permit students hands-on-experience in designing and               
              solving real time problems.  Tangible outputs of this project will             
              include two new text books, instructional manuals, software and tools.         
              Support will be provided to transfer the real-time systems                     
              environment to other institutions.
