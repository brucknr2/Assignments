Abstract    :
              This special minority award will give Ph.D. student Augstin Jose               
              Ros additional flexibility in pursuing his graduate studies and                
              research in economics.  This award will strengthen minority                    
              research participation in economics.  More specifically, the                   
              grant                                                                          
              will permit Ros to study the effects of the 1981/82 world                      
              recession                                                                      
              on Brazilian Economic development.                                             
                                                                                             
              Ros will investigate the overall effect the recession had on                   
              numerous macro and micro variables.  Special attention will be                 
              paid                                                                           
              to Brazil's important substitution policy implemented in the mid               
              seventies. The import substitution policy of the mid seventies                 
              was                                                                            
              geared to make Brazil less dependent on imported basic inputs and              
              capital goods.  This research investigates the net effect the                  
              recession had on these goals.  The grant permits Ros to                        
              investigate
