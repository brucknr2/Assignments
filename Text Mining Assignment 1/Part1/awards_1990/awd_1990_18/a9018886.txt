Abstract    :
                   This award provides partial funding for the acquisition of a              
              specialized cesium sputter ion source to be installed in the                   
              accelerator mass spectrometry facility at Purdue University. The               
              ion source will be capable of producing high-intensity beams of                
              ions of the elements beryllium, carbon, aluminum, chlorine, calcium            
              and iodine from target samples loaded in a 60-sample cassette. The             
              facility is based on a model FN tandem Van de Graff accelerator                
              and, with the installation of the ion source, will be capable of               
              measuring extremely small concentrations of the cosmogenic isotopes            
              (such as carbon-14, for example) of the above elements. These                  
              isotopes have proven useful as tracers and for determining the ages            
              of a wide variety of natural samples in which they are incorporated            
              at very low concentration levels.
