Abstract    :
                   This award will provide support to a group from Rochester                 
              University, to continue research in high energy physics.  The                  
              group will participate in a collaboration using the CLEO II                    
              detector at the Cornell Electron Storage Ring (CESR).  The                     
              collaboration plans a wide range of studies in high energy                     
              physics including the decay of heavy quarks.  The Rochester                    
              group will concentrate their studies on the decay of the heavy                 
              b quark.  In particular they will determine the fraction of b                  
              quarks that decay to u quarks rather than to c quarks, search                  
              for forbidden decays of b quarks and investigate the decays of                 
              the upsilon (4S) meson into non bb states.  These studies are                  
              fundamental to the corroboration of the so called "standard                    
              model" of the electronweak interactions.
