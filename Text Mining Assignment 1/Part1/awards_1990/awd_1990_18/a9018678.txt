Abstract    :
                   This award provides 50% funding for the development of                    
              chromatography and vacuum systems that will be installed and                   
              operated in the Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research at the                 
              University of Colorado. The University is committed to providing               
              the remaining funding required.                                                
                   The equipment will allow specific organic components such as              
              humic acids, lipids, and amino acids to be isolated from small (50-            
              300 microgram) samples for 14C dating using accelerator mass                   
              spectrometry.
