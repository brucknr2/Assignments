Abstract    :
                   The field of several complex variables is a broad and active              
              area of research, and the subject has connections with many other              
              important areas of mathematics.  In the past two decades                       
              especially, very rapid progress has been made on a large number of             
              problems of the subject.  Rather than survey the field as a whole,             
              this Symposium will concentrate only on certain aspects, in                    
              particular, on the detailed study of the boundary behavior of                  
              holomorphic functions and mappings in domains in n-dimensional                 
              complex space, on the construction of smooth domains in complex                
              space or complex manifolds which provide examples or                           
              counterexamples, and on the connection of complex analysis in                  
              several variables and harmonic analysis on nilpotent groups.                   
                   This grant will partially fund a week-long Symposium on                   
              Complex Analysis to be held at the University of Wisconsin-Madison             
              from June 2-7, 1991.  In addition to the 15 invited hour lectures,             
              there will be opportunity for shorter talks, seminars and more                 
              informal discussions.  The Symposium will bring together leading               
              researchers and graduate students in the area of several complex               
              variables.  The texts of the invited lectures, as well as other                
              contributed papers will be refereed and then published as a                    
              collection, so the results of the Symposium will be available to               
              the general mathematical community.
