Abstract    :
                   The study will test the Boyle model that vertical                         
              rearrangement of nutrients in the ocean through time can explain               
              the glacial/interglacial CO2 changes in the atmosphere.  This will             
              be accomplished through the reconstruction of bathymetric                      
              distribution of nutrients in the northwest tropical Pacific Ocean              
              over the past 25 K years and comparison of a 150 K years long                  
              record of mid-depth nutrient content of the Pacific with                       
              atmospheric CO2 record in Vostock ice core.  The study will also               
              verify the deglacial C-13 minimum that occurred in mid depth levels            
              of the subtropical Pacific.
