Abstract    :
              HeT DNA is a family of complex repeated sequences in the genome of             
              Drosophila melanogaster.  The sequences are entirely confined to               
              the telomeres and the pericentric heterochromatin.  One subset of              
              the HeT DNA family consists of the HeT-A elements a novel set of               
              retroposon-like elements that have bee found added onto the ends of            
              the four "healed" telomeres that have been studied in Drosophila or            
              they may be able to organize telomere sequences.                               
                                                                                             
              We propose to test the putative function of HeT DNA sequences by               
              attempting to construct functional Drosophila mini-chromosomes                 
              using these sequences.  The mini-chromosomes will be transformed               
              into cultured Drosophila cells and assayed for their ability to be             
              maintained and replicated as linear chromosomes.  Such chromosomes             
              would allow a direct test of our conclusions about functions of HeT            
              DNA sequences.  If we are successful in constructing mini-                     
              chromosomes, they will be a useful tool for other studies on                   
              Drosophila.***//
