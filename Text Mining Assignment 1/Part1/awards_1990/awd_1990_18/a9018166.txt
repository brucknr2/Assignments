Abstract    :
                This research is a continuation of a project begun in 1989 with              
              seismologists of the Institute of Physics of the Earth in Moscow               
              to exploit USSR seismic array data in central Asia: the Tien                   
              Shan.  The objective is to delineate the seismicity, structure,                
              and tectonics of this major continental collisional feature.                   
              Results to date include a significant reduction of earthquake                  
              epicenter scatter and 3-D velocity models of the Tien Shan.                    
              Further work will concentrate on wave-form modelling of converted              
              phases from discontinuities in the crust and upper mantle, shear-              
              wave velocity analysis from surface waves, and anisotropy                      
              investigations from SKS.  This research is a component of the                  
              National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
