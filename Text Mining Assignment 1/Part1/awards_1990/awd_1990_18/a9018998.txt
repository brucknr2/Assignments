Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research work deals with the development of optimal                       
              linear reconstruction schemes and algorithms for bandlimited                   
              signals from subband and other multiresolution                                 
              decompositions.  The main results expected are development                     
              and assessment of very flexible reconstruction algorithms                      
              which will satisfy multiple desirable criteria in the                          
              reconstruction process, such as:  robustness to additive                       
              noise and coding errors, as well as efficiency and                             
              flexibility in implementation.  Signal decomposition choices                   
              which perform better will be identified and evaluated.                         
                                                                                             
              These signal recovery techniques will be improvements and                      
              generalizations of existing rigid schemes based on Quadature                   
              Mirror Filter (QMF) banks, and Perfect Reconstruction (PR)                     
              filter banks.  These techniques do not directly take into                      
              account the effects of noise or implementation issues.                         
              Incorporation of new developments in multiresolution                           
              representations, including wavelet transforms, will be part                    
              of this research.  The potential applications of these                         
              techniques are in systems for efficient and flexible storage                   
              or transmissions of signals such as:  speech, audio, images                    
              and image sequences (video).  This last case is of major                       
              importance today in research for the following systems:                        
              high definition television, digital television, visual                         
              communication through ISDN, and space/earth transmission of                    
              visual scientific information.
