Abstract    :
              This project will use the petrologic framework of voluminous,                  
              middle Tertiary, intermediate to silicic volcanism in east-                    
              central Nevada as a basis for : (1) A study of the petrologic                  
              processes acting at an instant in the evolution of the system, by              
              completing work on zonation in the Kalamazoo Tuff; (2) A detailed              
              analysis of isotopic and textural changes during inception,                    
              climax, and waning of the system; and (3) Development of a mass                
              and thermal budget of an evolving magma system.  The rocks of                  
              east-central Nevada are particularly suited for this study                     
              because they represent a large volume (thousands of cubic                      
              kilometers) of metaluminous magma, the intrusive equivalent of                 
              which could be a typical "calcalkaline" batholith.  Also, they                 
              have been characterized with respect to their age, texture,                    
              mineralogy, and major-element, trace-element, and isotopic                     
              compositions, all of which are consistent with a three stage                   
              evolution of the magmatic system.
