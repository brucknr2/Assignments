Abstract    :
                   Despite recent advances in the understanding of processes                 
              leading to Lagerstatten formation, many important Lagerstatten have            
              yet to be studied from a combined taphonomic, sedimentologic,                  
              stratigraphic, paleoecologic, and geochemical perspective, all of              
              which lead to understanding of how Lagerstatten form.                          
              Understanding preservational processes in these exceptional                    
              deposits is important because: 1) taphonomic processes controlled              
              preservational biases, 2) understanding preservational processes               
              will lead to better understanding of the depositional environments             
              that ultimately exerted ecological control on the suite of                     
              organisms available for preservation, and 3) secular variations in             
              taphonomic processes could influence perceived evolutionary                    
              patterns.  Although most Carboniferous Lagerstatten occur in                   
              laminated mud-sized sediment, they may represent a range of                    
              depositional environments and paleoecologies.  To this end, this               
              is a study of five well-known Carboniferous Lagerstatten in North              
              America: Bear Gulch Limestone (Chesterian, Montana), Mecca Quarry              
              Shale (Desmoinesian, Indiana), Hamilton and Garnett localities                 
              (Virgilian, Kansas), and Kinney Brick Company Quarry (Virgilian,               
              New Mexico).  A multidisciplinary approach using stratigraphy,                 
              sedimentology, taphonomy, paleoecology, and geochemistry will be               
              used to distinguish among four models of Lagerstatten formation:               
              1) tidal sedimentation, 2) deposition in euxinic, stratified basin,            
              3) production of in-situ cyanobacterial mats, and 4) storm-bed                 
              deposition.//
