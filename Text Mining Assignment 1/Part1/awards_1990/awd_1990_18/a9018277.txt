Abstract    :
                   During the past ten years there has been a close symbiotic                
              relationship between the areas of probability in Banach Spaces and             
              modern empirical process theory, with the main ideas from one                  
              having one or more useful analogues in the other.  The conference              
              which this grant will support is divided into two one-week                     
              sessions.  The first, devoted to probability in separable Banach               
              spaces, will cover such topics as new finite-dimensional limit                 
              theorems, new infinite-dimensional limit theorems, proofs of                   
              probabilistic theorems in Banach spaces and applications of these              
              results to analysis and random sets.  The second week, devoted to              
              empirical process theory, will cover new work on Vapnik-Cervonenkis            
              combinatorics, entropy conditions, non-linear functionals and other            
              statistical aspects.                                                           
                   This conference will be held July 7-20 at Bowdoin College.                
              Each week of the conference will be composed of a minicourse and               
              individual lectures on recent results.  This will provide an                   
              excellent atmosphere for analysts, probabilists and statisticians              
              from these two overlapping fields to interact.
