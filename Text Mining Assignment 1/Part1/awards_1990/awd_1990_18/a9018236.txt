Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The goal of this work is to understand and control the chemical                
              nature of particular types of processing used to passivate GaAs                
              surfaces for improved electronic device performance, uniformity                
              and reliability.  The chemical nature of sulfidation of GaAs, its              
              dependence on particular processing parameters, and long term                  
              response to heat, light, and ambient gases are being studied.                  
              Infrared spectroscopy is used for real time in situ monitoring of              
              specific chemical and physical processes which occur at the                    
              surface.  Auxillary measurements using XPS and photoluminescence               
              are used to correlate film structure and chemistry with                        
              electronic properties.
