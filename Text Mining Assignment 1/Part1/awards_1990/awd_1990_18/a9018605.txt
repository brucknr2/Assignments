Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This grant will partially support a Research Symposium on                 
              Some Recent Developments in Homotopy Theory to be held at New                  
              Mexico State University in December 1990.                                      
                                                                                             
                   The composition of the Symposium centers on a series of ten               
              one-hour lectures to be presented by Professor Douglas C. Ravenel              
              of the University of Rochester.  Augmenting the lectures will be               
              sessions for contributed papers, research considerations, and                  
              discussion.  The focus of the lectures will be the Nilpotence                  
              Theorem of Devinatz-Hopkins-Smith and the Periodicity Theorem of               
              Hopkins-Smith, the algebraic considerations that motivated them,               
              and their applications.  The entire series of ten lectures,                    
              beginning with history, development of recent results, and                     
              thence into applications and open questions, will be video-                    
              taped, as will contributed talks on an individual-consent basis.
