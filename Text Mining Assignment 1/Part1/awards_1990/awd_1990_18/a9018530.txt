Abstract    :
              This award supports a ground-based radar sounding program in                   
              Antarctica on Ice Stream B with a primary purpose of                           
              determining the differential motion between the top of the                     
              ice and the base of the ice and the top of the bed.  This                      
              will be done by measuring the movement, relative to the                        
              surface, of diffraction ("fading") patterns associated with                    
              irregularities in the ice-bed interface.  Differential                         
              motion, which can be measured with a resolution of about 1                     
              meter, will be attributable to shear deformation within the                    
              ice sheet and sliding on its bed.  It is also planned to                       
              determine bed topography for drill-hole site selection and                     
              strain analyses, monitor drill holes for lateral penetration                   
              of water layers, study internal layering, and map near-                        
              surface crevasses using a short-pulse, high-resolution radar                   
              system.
