Abstract    :
              The College of Engineering at the University of California, Berkeley,          
              is developing a program for six underrepresented undergraduate                 
              engineering students to pursue doctoral degrees.  To meet the objectives       
              of the program the College's Women and Graduate Minority Program will          
              actively recruit underrepresented students, assist them in the                 
              application process, and award Graduate Engineering Education                  
              Fellowships in accordance with selection guidelines.  Graduate                 
              Engineering Education Fellows will be place in research throughout the         
              College in areas in which the nation faces growing and critical needs,         
              but where the supply of new doctorates is inadequate.
