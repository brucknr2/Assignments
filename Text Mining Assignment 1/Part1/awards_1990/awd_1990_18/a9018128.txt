Abstract    :
              The principal investigator, in a collaborative effort with David               
              Yuen (Univ. of Minnesota), will model binary solid-melt phase                  
              change problems in magmatic systems.  The solid, mush, and                     
              totally molten regions will be solved for temperature, fraction                
              solidified, velocity, pressure, and coexisting solid (if present)              
              and melt at every location and time.  The model will be tested                 
              against existing experimental data for various systems.  Further,              
              it will be used to address fundamental questions about igneous                 
              processes for both basaltic and granitic systems.
