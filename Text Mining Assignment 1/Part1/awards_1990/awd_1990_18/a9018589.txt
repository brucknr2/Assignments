Abstract    :
                This research is to do a broadband seismic study of the Earth's              
              mantle using a combination of ScS reverberations and traditional               
              passive-seismic methods, such as fundamental and higher-mode                   
              surface-wave dispersion, regional phase, and mode-converted phase              
              analyses.  Digital data sets from the IRIS, GDSN, Chinese digital              
              seismic network, RSTN, and Geoscope networks will be utilized.                 
              The transition width and lateral continuity of mantle                          
              discontinuities will be mapped and applied to questions of the                 
              extent of the continental roots and how discontinuities are                    
              dominated by chemical versus phase change transitions.
