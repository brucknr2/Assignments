Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The time is ripe for a review of the progress in                          
              marine chemistry. Ths is particularly true with the advent of                  
              global change issues. Such issues like the exchange of greenhoue               
              gases with ocean or availability of trace micro nutrients in                   
              limiting primary productivity depend fundamentally on the                      
              physical chemistry of sea water. The American Chemical Society                 
              has long been a champion of the bright of marine chemistry as a                
              new field of applied chemistry. At its 200th annual meeting,                   
              the ACS has chosen to recognize marine chemistry by holding                    
              a symposium on Progress in Marine Chemistry. The symposium will                
              be sponsored by the Geochemistry Division of ACS and will be held              
              August 27 and 28 in Washington, DC. The Geochemistry Division                  
              will also take the opportunity of honoring the contribution of                 
              Professor Edward D. Goldberg to marine chemistry during his long               
              and productive career.
