Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Structure function relationship in enolase will be studied                     
              using a combination of x-ray crystallography, site directed                    
              mutagenesis, and kinetic studies.  There are two, or perhaps                   
              three, divalent metal ion binding sites per subunit of enolase                 
              which are sequentially filled.  Some metal ions activate                       
              enolase, others bind strongly but don not activate.  Dr.                       
              Lebioda will study ternary and quaternary complexes of enolase-                
              metal ion-substrate-metal ion to image the sequential steps in                 
              the enzyme mechanism.  Crystals of mutant enolase will be                      
              obtained (in collaboration with Drs.  Brewer and Robson) and                   
              their structure determined.  The mechanism of enolase                          
              inhibition by fluoride ions will be studied.  Interaction of                   
              single stranded DNA with enolase will be modeled by studying                   
              the complexes of oligonucleotides with enolase.  The yeast                     
              enolase crystals scatter to 1.8A resolution; this makes the                    
              system an excellent object of the proposed studies.                            
                                                                                             
              In addition to enolase research, Dr. Lebioda also proposes to                  
              study the structure of another metalloenzyme, transcarboxylase                 
              (TC).  There is significant sequence identity indicating homology              
              between TC and one or more domains of other biotin enzymes. Thus,              
              its structure will be representative for this class of proteins.
