Abstract    :
              The objective is to demonstrate the use of a nondestructive method             
              called the Spectral-Analysis-of-Surface-Waves (SASW) to evaluate,              
              1) the degree of damage to the structural and foundation elements,             
              2) location and extent of damage, and 3) the extent and quality of             
              repair.  One of the key thrusts of research will be the integrated             
              study of both body and surface stress waves.
