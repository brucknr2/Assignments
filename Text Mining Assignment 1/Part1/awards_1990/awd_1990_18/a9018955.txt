Abstract    :
              The principal investigator, in collaboration with Theodore                     
              Labotka of the University of Tennessee, will study the 160 Ma                  
              regionally metamorphosed calcareous argillites in the Wildrose                 
              Canyon area of the Panamint Mountains, California.  The purpose                
              of the work will be to understand the effects of fluids on the                 
              geochemistry and minerals of rocks which have undergone low-                   
              pressure regional prograde and retrograde metamorphism.                        
              Principal methods to be utilized include petrographic work (and                
              in turn phase equilibria analyses), stable isotope measurements,               
              and total major-element mass  balance calculations.  The study                 
              will enhance our understanding of regional metamorphism and                    
              fluid-rock interactions at mid-crustal depths.
