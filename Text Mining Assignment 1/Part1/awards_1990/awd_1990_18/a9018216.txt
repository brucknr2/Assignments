Abstract    :
              This project is to model several different aspects of the                      
              emplacement of silicic lava flows and domes, using a combination               
              of field mapping, isotopic determinations, laboratory simulation,              
              image processing of topographic and remote sensing data sets, and              
              theoretical analyses of cooling.  Aims: (1) determine                          
              relationships among lava texture, volatile contents, isotopic                  
              characteristics, and eruptive parameters; (2) use thermal infra-               
              red spectrometry to map the chemistry of lava flows; (3) map                   
              compositional variations and calculate cooling profiles of a very              
              large rhyolite flow in SW Idaho; (4) use laboratory and                        
              theoretical models to determine which factors control the                      
              intrusive or extrusive style of silicic domes.
