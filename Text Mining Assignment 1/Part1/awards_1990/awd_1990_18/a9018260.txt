Abstract    :
              The objective is to understand in chemical-mechanical terms how                
              ribosomes and the macromolecules that interact with them form                  
              proteins.  The primary objective is to monitor and describe the                
              extension of a nascent peptide as it is extended by the stepwise               
              addition of amino acids at the ribosomal peptidyl transferase                  
              center.  particular attention will be given to the question  of                
              whether the nascent peptide is channeled from the peptidyl                     
              transferase to the exit domain through a tunnel that transversed               
              the large ribosomal subunit, and if so, to determine how the                   
              nascent peptide is inserted into the tunnel.  Secondary objective              
              are to determine when the mRNA moves through the ribosome during               
              the reaction step of peptide elongation and to further analyze                 
              how antibiotics such as erythromycin and chloromphenical inhibit               
              protein synthesis.  The approach is to covalently attack                       
              fluorophores at specific sites on the tRNA, mRNA ribosomal                     
              proteins, and ribosomal RMA, then to use fluorescence techniques               
              to monitor changes in the position and conformation of the                     
              components that occur during the specific reaction steps of                    
              protein synthesis.  The results are anticipated to be directly                 
              relevant to the in vitro synthesis of artificial enzymes by                    
              biotechnological procedures and to the control of protein                      
              synthesis in certain pathologies.
