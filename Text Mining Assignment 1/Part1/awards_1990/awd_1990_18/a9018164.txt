Abstract    :
              9018164                                                                        
              This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                      
              continuing work of Professor Gajewski at Indiana University. The               
              results of this research will provide fundamental information                  
              about the exact mode by which organic molecules undergo thermal                
              reactions and rearrangements. One  of the questions to be answered             
              is, are there short-lived intermediates in these processes or do               
              they occur in a one step process without intermediates? Knowledge              
              of these processes is important to a basic understanding of                    
              organic chemistry.                                                             
                                                                                             
              Dr. Gajewski's research will provide basic information about                   
              thermal reactions and rearrangements in several areas. There is a              
              concern that the preferred suprafacial-inversion stereochemistry               
              in methylvinyl cyclopropanes is determined by substituent effects              
              rather than by orbital symmetry. An attempt will be made to                    
              resolve this question by the use of deuterium isotope effects.                 
              Another phase of the research deals with oxyanionic vinyl                      
              cyclopropane and cyclobutane rearrangements, where two orbital                 
              symmetry allowed concerted reactions and a stepwise reaction are               
              possible. Deuterium isotope effects will be used to sort out these             
              possible mechanisms as a function of solvent and counterion. In                
              addition, substituent effects on Cope rearrangements will be                   
              studied and the question of double rotation in the thermolysis of              
              spiropentane geometric isomerization will be pursued.
