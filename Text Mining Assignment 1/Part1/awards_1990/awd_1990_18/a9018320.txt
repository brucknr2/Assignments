Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              All cells are known to transiently increase the expression of a                
              group of proteins--the heat shock or stress proteins--in response              
              to a variety of imposed stresses.  These proteins, known to be                 
              present at reduced, but significant, levels in non-stressed cells              
              are of, largely, unknown function, although the hsp70 family have              
              been implicated recently as essential for protein maturation                   
              events.  The work planned will focus on putative interactions of               
              hsps70, both in vivo and in vivo,  focusing on the role of ATP in              
              binding/release of targets, and in the fate of targeted proteins;              
              evaluation of amounts and types of pre-existing proteins that may              
              interact with hsp70, as a function of stress, and the relationship             
              to thermotolerance will be studied.   Such studies should lead to              
              a fuller comprehension of the functions of hsps in normal cell                 
              events, and in those that accompany stress responses.                          
                                                                                             
              The cellular responses to a variety of stresses--heat, heavy metal             
              contamination, pressure, etc.--involve an increased level of                   
              synthesis of certain proteins designated heat-shock-proteins; the              
              interactions of these proteins with other cell proteins will be                
              examined as part of an effort to understand the precise role these             
              heat shock proteins play in normal, as well as stressed, cells. //
