Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              In order to meet its objectives, the Joint Global Ocean Flux                   
              Study must operate in both spatially intensive and spatially                   
              extensive modes (JGOFS, 1990), that is, in process studies at                  
              specific sites and in ocean surveys.  This project is for the                  
              collection and processing of data on optics and pigment                        
              distributions in the survey mode, and combines the efforts of                  
              JGOFS and the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE)                        
              Hydrographic Program (WHP).  The researchers will operate a bio-               
              optical profiler to collect data on the biological and optical                 
              properties of the upper water column.  The measurements to be                  
              made include spectral irradiance (upwelling and downwelling),                  
              broad-band visible irradiance (PAR), fluorescence, and beam                    
              transmission.  This study represents the first undertaking of a                
              systematic and consistent data collection on the oceans pigment                
              and optical properties, and should be invaluable in improving                  
              algorithms for satellite imaging of ocean pigments and in                      
              estimating primary production.  The data collected under this                  
              program will be provided to the oceanographic community in                     
              particular to JGOFS and WOCE Investigators in a timely fashion                 
              for analysis.
