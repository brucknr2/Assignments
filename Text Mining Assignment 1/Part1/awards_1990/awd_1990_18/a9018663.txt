Abstract    :
                   The Ceratopsia or horned dinosaurs represent an evolutionary              
              radiation of dinosaurs rich in morphological variation but                     
              circumscribed taxonomically.  The known history of the Ceratopsia              
              extends between late Early Cretaceous and the end of the                       
              Cretaceous.  Major patterns of the phylogenetic and stratigraphic              
              history of the Ceratopsia have been established.  The purpose of               
              the proposed study is to apply procedures of modern multivariate               
              morphometrics, including tensor methods of landmark analysis,                  
              finite-element analyses, principal components analyses with                    
              appropriate shear, and resistant-fit theta-rho analysis, to samples            
              of Centrosaurus and Chasmosaurus in order to map out patterns of               
              variation within species.  A point of focus will be the                        
              documentation of fluctuating asymmetries, which may reveal the                 
              genetic structure of the species.  Functional trends in ceratopsian            
              skulls will be traced, and stratigraphic trends in the evolution               
              of the masticatory system will be determined.  I will test the                 
              hypothesis that changes in the jaw suspensorium; rejection of this             
              hypothesis will call into question the use of the frill for muscle             
              origins.  This study will provide a model for further studies of               
              dinosaur morphometrics, and will contribute to understanding                   
              biodiversity of the past, and thus the biodiversity of our own                 
              world.
