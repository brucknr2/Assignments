Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The hormone responsive glue genes of Drosophila are expressed at               
              high levels in the salivary glands of late third instar larvae.                
              Unlike the other glue genes, Sgs-4 is expressed at early times in              
              development and in a second tissue, the proventriculus. Dr.                    
              Beckendorf proposes to use footprinting, in vitro mutatgenesis,                
              and germ line transformation to establish which cis acting                     
              sequences govern this unique expression pattern. Because the Sgs-              
              4 enhancer is made up of multiple, partially interchangeable                   
              elements, the interactions of these elements and the differences               
              in their regulatory functions will be examined. To isolate trans-              
              regulators of Sgs-4, a monoclonal antibody library directed                    
              against salivary gland DNA binding proteins will be constructed                
              in phage lambda. Monoclonal antibodies will be isolated after                  
              screening with enhancer DNa-protein complexes. These monoclonals               
              will then be used to screen a cDNA library. Isolated cDNA clones               
              and the antibodies used to isolate them will then be used to                   
              characterize the regulation and expression patterns of the new                 
              genes and the DNA-binding activities of the proteins.
