Abstract    :
              Project WENDI (Women Engineering Doctoral Incentives) at the University        
              of Kentucky presents a strategy for increasing the number of female            
              Ph.D.s pursuing research careers in academia, industry, and government.        
              It specifically provides a strategy for a mid-tier chemical engineering        
              department to produce increase the number of new female Ph.D.s over the        
              next several years, beginning with three fellowships.  To encourage            
              women to consider graduate study, Project WENDI proposes a mentoring           
              program for our undergraduates and contact with our alumni to reach            
              potential non-traditional students.  A "critical Mass" of women will           
              result from these efforts.
