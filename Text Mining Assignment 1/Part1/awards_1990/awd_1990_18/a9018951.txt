Abstract    :
                   This study will extend earlier work on time control of the                
              major deformation and syntectonic deposition events on the southern            
              flank of the Pyrenees.  Active shortening occurred on the southern             
              margin of the Ebro basin at the same time as strike-slip faulting              
              occurred along the Catalan Coast Range transpressional margin.                 
              This project will investigate the timing of the deformation and the            
              amount of rotational strain along the Catalan Coast Range by dating            
              a series of fan-deltas, and will relate the findings to deformation            
              in the Pyrenees to the north.  The fan deltas will also be studied             
              for contrasts in size, position along the range front, source                  
              area(s) and syntectonic sedimentation characteristics.  The results            
              of this study will allow the relative roles of tectonism and                   
              sediment supply to be evaluated for these foreland basins, and will            
              have significance for foreland basin development in other orogenic             
              belts.
