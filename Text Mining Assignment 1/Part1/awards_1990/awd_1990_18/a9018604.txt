Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will endeavor into an important area of study.                    
              The P.I. intends to study comparisons across generations within                
              the Mexican and Mexican-Americans cultural groups. It has been                 
              identified that Mexican and Mexican-Americans have the highest                 
              fertility rate in the U.S. and are projected to comprise the                   
              majority of the population in certain parts of the country by                  
              the end of the century. Information regarding the early                        
              socialization practices of Mexican and Mexican-Americans would                 
              provide valuable assistance to social scientists and                           
              practitioners interested in understanding how cultural                         
              background interacts with early experiences to influence                       
              developmental outcome in children. Prior research has pointed                  
              out that one of the most important factors affecting a child's                 
              development is the quality of the mother-infant attachment                     
              relationship. Attachment has been defined as an affectional tie                
              that one person develops with another person that transcends                   
              time and space.  The goal of the attachment relationship is                    
              that of felt security in the infant. The development of a                      
              secure attachment is thought to encourage exploratory                          
              behavior, promote social competence with peers, and assist with                
              the development of ego resiliency by school age.  The proposed                 
              study intends to build upon Beckwith and Cohen's findings on                   
              attachment by comparing and contrasting the quality of the                     
              mother-infant relationship and security attachment.
