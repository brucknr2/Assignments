Abstract    :
                   Matchup scheduling is a strategy for overcoming disruptions               
              in large, complex scheduling systems.  It assumes that a                       
              preschedule has been constructed offline to set material and labor             
              schedules.  While operating the system, a disruption, such as                  
              machine breakdown or material unavailability, has rendered the                 
              preschedule obsolete. Matchup scheduling reconstructes a small                 
              section of the preschedule resulting in a feasible, near-optimal               
              schedule.  To execute this strategy, the schedule beyond a selected            
              matchup time is not altered.  Jobs on a subset of machines are                 
              rescheduled with the objective of matching up with the preschedule             
              at the matchup time.  That is, all inventories and machine setups              
              should be as if the disruption had not occurred.  It is assumed                
              that this is possible due to slack in the preschedule for the                  
              disrupted family of machines.  It has been shown that, under quite             
              general conditions, such a process can be carried out without loss             
              of optimality.                                                                 
                  It is the intent of this project to enhance this strategy by               
              (1) applying new theory to better choose the matchup  time, and (2)            
              enhancing the methods used for reconstructing the  schedule                    
              section.  The approach will be evaluated against optimal schedules             
              or bounds on optimal schedules.//
