Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A cooperative program with oceanographers at Kagoshima and Kyushu              
              Universities in Japan will investigate the variability of the                  
              Kuroshio for about one year.  Seven inverted echo sounders (IES)               
              complement the array of current meters provided by the Japanese                
              universities and allow time series of baroclinic fluctuations to               
              be calculated.  Free exchange of data and joint analysis will                  
              take place between the principal investigators.
