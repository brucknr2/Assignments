Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will develop new means to predict                   
              diffusion kinetics data for rock-forming minerals, measure                     
              specific cation diffusion kinetics useful for predictive                       
              capabilities, and collect new oxygen diffusion data to clarify                 
              contradictions in the literature.  One objective of this work is               
              to establish a framework that permits computation of a diffusion               
              coefficient for any particular mineral under a given set of                    
              physical conditions, and in turn develop a data base that can be               
              used to solve a range of problems for which diffusion data are                 
              not yet available.  An attempt  also will be made to understand                
              the diffusion data on a sound theoretical basis.  Results will                 
              have wide application in geochronology, metamorphic petrology,                 
              and many other areas of geology.
