Abstract    :
              The purpose of the Tennessee Technological University project is               
              threefold:  (1) to encourage female engineering students to enroll in          
              graduate school and continue their studies until they have attained the        
              Ph.D. degree;  (2) to assist such students to understand the                   
              expectations of graduate education and fully develop their potential in        
              school and beyond; and (3) to encourage the students to consider careers       
              as engineering educators.  Special encouragement and support of the            
              students will be provided by the project director and two specially            
              selected outstanding engineering faculty members (mentors) in addition         
              to the support provided by each student's major professor.  The director       
              and mentors will recruit the students, will meet regularly with them,          
              will monitor their progress, and will offer help and guidance relative         
              to the students' personal and career development.
