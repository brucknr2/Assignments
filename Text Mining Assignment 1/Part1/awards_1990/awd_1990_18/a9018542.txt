Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Leukotrienes are biomedically important regulatory compounds                   
              synthesized from arachidonic acid by 5-lipoxygenase/LTA4 synthase              
              in mammals.  However, information concerning the structures and                
              functions of leukotrienes is almost completely lacking in non-                 
              mammalian vertebrates.  It is important to examine leukotriene                 
              synthesis and action in poikilothermic vertebrates, such as                    
              amphibians because (a) their cell membranes contain other                      
              polyunsaturated fatty acids which may modulate leukotriene                     
              synthesis (b) metabolic and physiological processes are affected               
              by environmental temperature and (c) frog tissues are simpler than             
              their mammalian counterparts and can serve as less complex model               
              for leukotriene action.  Previous research by this laboratory has              
              demonstrated biological effects of leukotrienes on hypotension in              
              cannulated bullfrogs and in in vitro studies on contractility of               
              isolated bullfrog heart and lung strips.  This proposal will                   
              examine 1) regulation of leukotriene synthesis by heart, lung, and             
              blood vessels 2) involvement of cyclic nucleotides and                         
              phosphoinositides in the mechanism of leukotriene action on the                
              heart, lung, and vascular system and 3) characterization of                    
              leukotriene binding to amphibian heart and lung membrane receptors             
              using radioreceptor assays and autoradiography.  The proposed                  
              research will provide additional insight into the evolution of                 
              these important regulatory compounds.//
