Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will map, sample, and make a                        
              mineralogic-petrologic-geochemical-isotopic study of selected                  
              plutonic and volcanic rocks in north Luzon, Philippines.  The                  
              purpose is to determine the chemical and isotopic compositions of              
              four distinct increments of crustal rocks that have led to the                 
              progressive transformation from basaltic island arc crust to more              
              highly evolved crust.  The investigation will address the                      
              question of whether the Luzon arc systems formed largely from                  
              melts of the mantle wedge above subduction zones, followed by                  
              modification via assimilation zone-refining of the arc crust,                  
              plus fractional crystallization, resulting later in the                        
              production  of more granitic compositions.  This area offers a                 
              unique opportunity for geologists to trace the early stages of                 
              crustal evolution of a microcontinent.
