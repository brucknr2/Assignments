              support for Richard Astur, a graduate student at Michigan State                
              University.  The award will allow Mr. Astur to continue work on                
              his thesis project in particle physics at Fermilab.  This award                
              is an integral part of the strategy of the National Science                    
              Foundation to strengthen and increase minority participation in                
              the field of physics.
