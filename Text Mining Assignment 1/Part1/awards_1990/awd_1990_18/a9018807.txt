Abstract    :
              Block copolymers enjoy increasing use in a wide range of materials             
              applications, due primarily to properties derived from the                     
              thermodynamic interactions between blocks.  With increasing chain              
              length and/or interaction strength, block copolymer liquids undergo            
              an order-disorder transition (ODT) to a microstructured state.                 
              Although much has been learned about the accessible morphologies in            
              the strong-segregation limit, i.e., well into the ordered state,               
              the behavior in the vicinity of the ODT, i.e., the weak-segregation            
              limit, is much less understood.  We will use a powerful optical                
              technique, oscillatory flow birefringence (OFB), to both diagnose              
              and characterize the ODT and associated order-order transitions.               
              In addition, extensive calculations have shown that the dilute-                
              solution OFB properties of block copolymers are uniquely sensitive             
              to the lengths and chain locations of the various blocks; both                 
              quantities are otherwise difficult to determine.  We will explore              
              the potential of OFB as a characterization tool for block                      
              copolymers, and in so doing assess the effect of the block-block               
              interaction on the relaxation spectrum.  Finally, the investigation            
              will be continued of the role of the solvent in conformational                 
              dynamics experiments such as OFB, both in terms of solvent dynamics            
              and solvent quality.  In particular, a remarkable relationship                 
              between solvent rotational relaxation and the high-frequency                   
              viscoelastic properties of polymer solutions will be examined                  
              further.
