Abstract    :
              The structure imposed upon spoken sentences by intonation seems                
              frequently to be orthogonal to their traditional surface-                      
              syntactic structure.  The involvement of two apparently uncoupled              
              levels of structure in Natural Language grammar appears to                     
              complicate the path form speech to interpretation unreasonably                 
              and to thereby threaten a number of computational unreasonably,                
              and to thereby threaten a number of computational applications in              
              speech recognition and speech synthesis.  This work will complete              
              the specification of a generative theory of intonation in                      
              relation to syntax and discourse function, and instantiate the                 
              theory by constructing a "discourse-model driven" utterance                    
              generator and speech synthesizer.  Such a device is to be                      
              contrasted with "text-to-speech" generation.  The input to the                 
              system will be a representation of discourse context                           
              characteristic of a simple natural language query system.  On the              
              basis of such representations,  the system will be capable of                  
              constructing a variety of contextually appropriate intonation                  
              contours for any given sentence covered by its grammar.  Such a                
              device is expected to considerably improve comprehensibility and               
              naturalness of the synthesized speech.
