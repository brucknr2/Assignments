Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The research proposed focuses on an apparent interaction between               
              two chloroplast enzymes, an interaction that may play significant              
              roles in regulation of carbon dioxide fixation in photosynthesis.              
              The studies will assess whether interactions between one of these              
              enymes and others in the reductive pentose-phosphate pathway occur;            
              kinetic analyses and phase partition experiments, and effects of               
              putative modulators will be employed to explore potential                      
              interactions.  The findings will be pertinent to understanding                 
              regulation of key events in photosynthesis.                                    
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
              The role of possible interactions between different enzymes                    
              involved in the chloroplast's metabolism of carbon dioxide during              
              the latter's conversion to organic compounds will be examined in               
              this research; an enlarged understanding of the regulation of                  
              carbon dioxide fixation in photosynthetic organisms should result.
