Abstract    :
                This research is to investigate the factors that control the                 
              localization of moment release at subduction zones.  By comparing              
              the positions of maximum moment release between subduction zones               
              with different characteristics and correlating them with a                     
              variety of subduction zone parameters, information on the                      
              physical processes that influence the localization of moment                   
              release will be revealed.  Determination of whether earthquakes                
              of very different magnitudes rupture the same regions on the                   
              plate interface is important in understanding the role that fault              
              strength plays in the localization of moment release.  Since                   
              great earthquakes account for the majority of moment release at                
              subduction zones, their influence on seismic behavior is                       
              essential to understanding the localization of moment release.                 
              This research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard                 
              Reduction Program.
