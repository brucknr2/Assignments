Abstract    :
                   This New England Appalachians are composed of several tectonic            
              blocks whose relationships to one another are relatively unknown               
              or poorly constrained.  Existing models indicate origins are                   
              diverse and spatially separate, so detrital zircons in sedimentary             
              assemblages may be distinctive.  This project will apply a recently            
              developed direct 11 evaporation mass spectrometric technique for               
              single zircon grains to several of the tectonic blocks to                      
              characterize the age of continental and/or volcanic-arc sources of             
              the sediments included in each terrane.  Results will evaluate the             
              utility of this technique in testing the various models that have              
              specified the relative locations of blocks through the Paleozoic               
              evolution of the Appalachians.
