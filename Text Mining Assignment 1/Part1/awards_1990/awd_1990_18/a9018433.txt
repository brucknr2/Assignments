Abstract    :
                   Geometric studies in thrust belts have given rise to a number             
              of kinematic models for the development of specific structural                 
              geometries, but the models have remained to a large extent untested            
              for large scale examples because of a lack of sufficient                       
              incremental strain data and diagnostic microstructures.  This                  
              project is designed to provide an adequate data set from well-                 
              exposed folds and thrusts in the northern Lost River Range in Idaho            
              in order to constrain models for the development of those                      
              structures.  The work involves construction of detailed 3-D                    
              structural geometries and cross-sections and the determination of              
              strain histories using syntectonic fibers from samples collected               
              from appropriate parts of these structures.  Results are expected              
              to allow a vigorous test of several hypotheses concerning how such             
              folds and thrusts develop.  The outcome will be utility in                     
              understanding the kinematics of deformation in other fold and                  
              thrust belts.
