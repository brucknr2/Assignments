Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Electrical conductivity, which depends on ionic fluids, metal             
              or carbon content and temperature, provides complementary                      
              information to properties determined from seismic or potential                 
              field data.  Our ability to image conductivity structure has                   
              recently undergone a revolution.  This is a project involving high             
              resolution magnetotelluric (MT) profiling in the Trans-Hudson                  
              Orogen (THO) and the southeast Appalachians (SEA).  The common                 
              element in the two experiments is illumination of processes in                 
              fossil zones of continental collision.  The THO experiment will                
              coincide with an 850 channel COCORP seismic reflection line across             
              the Williston Basin and will be closely coordinated with the                   
              Lithoprobe transect of the THO.  The THO project will focus on the             
              largest known conductivity anomaly in N. America and on the upper              
              mantle structure of the area.  The SEA experiment will take                    
              advantage of the fact that the ocean edge can amplify MT response              
              to certain structures.  It is expected to settle the controversy               
              about the location of the Alleghanian suture, map the sedimentary              
              package under the thrust associated with this collision event,                 
              provide important insight into the preservation of retrograde                  
              metamorphic conditions in deep continental crust and estimate the              
              volatile content in (and the presence of partial melt beneath) very            
              old oceanic lithosphere.
