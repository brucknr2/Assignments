Abstract    :
              This is an award to support research on developing a                           
              method for rapid detection and identification of the HIV-I                     
              in environmental media by use of a method involving                            
              extraction of nucleic acids from the samples and                               
              amplification of the target deoxyribonucleic acid                              
              sequences using a polymerase chain reaction method.  This                      
              method has been used to detect low numbers of genetically                      
              engineered microorganisms in environmental media.  A                           
              similar method proposed for study in this project has                          
              shown promise in improving the sensitivity for detection                       
              of retroviruses such as the HIV-I in environmental media.                      
                                                                                             
              The results of this project are expected to be useful in                       
              developing a method for determining the presence and                           
              amount of the target virus in environmental media and may                      
              lead to development of strategies for use in engineering                       
              design of collection and treatment systems for waste                           
              residues that are contaminated with viruses of                                 
              significance to public health.
