Abstract    :
                   This award provides 50% funding for the acquisition of a                  
              modest computer system that will be used to control and automate               
              the operation of a stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer installed            
              in the Division of Marine Geology and Geophysics at the University             
              of Miami. The University is committed to providing the remaining               
              funds needed.                                                                  
                   The stable isotope laboratory at Miami is actively engaged in             
              a number of projects involving isotopic analyses of large numbers              
              of samples, and the lab's current, non-automated system is causing             
              a serious bottleneck. A modest investment in a PC based automation             
              system will provide a much-needed improvement.
