Abstract    :
              This award is made as the starter grant increment of Dr. John                  
              Griffin's Postdoctoral Fellowship in Chemistry Award in support                
              of his research at Stanford University. The thrust of Dr.                      
              Griffin's research is the isolation, purification and                          
              characterization of enzyme and antibody catalysyts for polyene                 
              cyclization reactions.                                                         
                                                                                             
              Enzymatic activity of purified cyclase will be quantified and                  
              the amino acid and gene sequence will be determined. The                       
              cyclizing acive site will be studied through affinity labelling                
              and directed mutagenesis experiments.  This should permit the                  
              design and preparation of engineered enzymes having novel                      
              substrate and/or product specificities. Heterobicyclic                         
              immunogens will be synthesized which will elicit antibodies                    
              capable of initiating, directing and terminating the                           
              cyclization of diene epoxides. Once antibody catalysts have                    
              been identified, their mechanism of action will be studied.                    
              This should lead to a better understanding of sterol                           
              biosynthesis and macromolecular catalysis and may provide                      
              useful catalysts for the synthesis of sterols.
