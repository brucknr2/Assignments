Abstract    :
                This research is to analyze body wave phases recorded over a                 
              period of several months by a digital three-component local array              
              operated in the Subandean Province and East Peru Basin above the               
              zone of flat subduction and resubduction in the central Andes.                 
              The analysis will include a systematic interpretation and                      
              inversion of body wave seismograms making use of a recently                    
              developed technique for the deterministic calculation of                       
              synthetic seismograms.  Dipping plate structures outside the                   
              region of flat subduction will be studied by means of 3-D ray                  
              tracing routines which incorporate conversions and reflections at              
              first-order discontinuities.  The Andean system offers unique                  
              opportunities for the study of many fundamental problems of                    
              continental dynamics including earthquake hazard, and the fine                 
              structure and properties of the subducting slab, the overriding                
              lithosphere and the interface between them.  This research is a                
              component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
