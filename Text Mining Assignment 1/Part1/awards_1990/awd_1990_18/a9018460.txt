Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports the study of the response spectrum of the                  
              Avalanche Breakdown (AB) detector, and its high detection                      
              sensitivity in the far infrared.  Recently, response has been                  
              measured for very low powers at a wavelength of 151 microns.                   
              This approaches the ultimate quantum detectivity limit.  The                   
              detector element is n-type germanium maintained unconventionally               
              at a bias current above the point of impact ionization.  Under                 
              these conditions, the signal current is found to be proportional               
              to the square rood of the incident power.  Although several                    
              mechanisms have been suggested to explain this unusual behavior,               
              none has yet proven satisfactory.                                              
                                                                                             
              The Free Electron Laser (FEL) at University of California, Santa               
              Barbara, will be used to measure the detector's response spectrum              
              over a wide range in the far infrared.  These studies will                     
              provide the theoretical framework necessary for further work as                
              well as more complete experimental results.
