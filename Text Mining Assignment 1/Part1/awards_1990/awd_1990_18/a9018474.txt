Abstract    :
              The PI propose to test if the prokaryotic EcoRI DNA                            
              methyltransferase (MTase) catalyzes methylation at N6 of                       
              adenine via a covalent intermediate involving cysteine 223                     
              and the C6 position of adenine.  This will be tested by                        
              constructing and testing mutant enzymes containing serine,                     
              glycine or alanine in place of cysteine 223.  The existence                    
              of a covalent intermediate will be further tested with a                       
              mechanism-based inhibitor designed to activate the enzyme by                   
              forming a covalent linkage between cysteine 223 and the                        
              inhibitor.  In addition to elucidating the chemical mechanism                  
              of this enzyme, these results may provide a new class of                       
              highly specific inhibitors as well as providing insights into                  
              the design of (bio)catalysts with novel substrate                              
              specificities and mechanisms.  using both random and                           
              nonrandom in vitro mutagenesis methods, the substrate                          
              specificity of the enzyme will be offered.  Specificity                        
              mutants will be identified through molecular selection and                     
              gene amplification using polymerase chain reaction                             
              techniques. Understanding which amino acids are critical for                   
              DNA recognition will aid in understanding of sequence-                         
              specific DNA modification mechanisms and may aid the design                    
              of agents with novel specificities.
