Abstract    :
              In the course of our work on the control of flagellar formation                
              we showed that flagelin gene expression was controlled by DNA                  
              inversion mediated by Hin Recombinase.  Our detailed studies                   
              of the mechanisms of this reaction have revealed that it involves              
              the formation of nucleo-protein complexes that include multiple                
              proteins associated with specific DNA binding sites.  The                      
              assembly of similar structures involving elaborated DNA-protein                
              interactions has been implicated in the mechanisms involved in                 
              specific gene expression, viral integration and transposition.                 
              Hin-Recombinase offers a relatively simple model in which to                   
              study the role of "enhancers" and other "factors" in the                       
              formation of the complex DNA-protein structures required to                    
              achieve efficient, site specific, directional recombination.  Our              
              immediate goal is to understand in detail the nature of the Hin                
              Recombinase reaction, i.e. the mechanism of Hin-DNA interaction,               
              the activation of the Hin-DNA cleavage reaction, the nature of                 
              the interaction of Hin with the enhancer complex and the                       
              mechanism involved in Hin-DNA inversion.  We will use extensive                
              mutagenesis, studies of invivo function and in vitro                           
              reconstitution with modified protein and DNA sites to understand               
              how the recombinase and enhancer function during the course of                 
              the reaction.
