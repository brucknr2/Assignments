Abstract    :
              Geomagnetically induced currents (GIC) could saturate                          
              a transformer core and result in transformer stray flux                        
              heating.  Many such incidents have occurred during the                         
              March 1989 K-9 solar magnetic disturbance.  Stray flux                         
              distribution within a transformer is complicated and                           
              involves many factors.  A systematic three dimensional                         
              analysis of transformer flux distribution under GIC is                         
              proposed.  Magnetic fields everywhere inside a                                 
              transformer will be calculated.  Stray flux patterns as well                   
              as eddy currents for different transformer designs, core                       
              configurations will be analyzed and compared.  The                             
              objectives of this study are to reveal the fundamental                         
              transformer magnetization mechanism under the                                  
              influence of GIC, to assess potential stray flux heating                       
              possibilities of geologically vulnerable transformer units.                    
              The research findings will help utilities to justify the                       
              needs for mitigation actions on high risk units.                               
              Manufacturers may use the research results to review                           
              their design strategies and introduce possible design                          
              considerations to reduce GIC effects in the future.
