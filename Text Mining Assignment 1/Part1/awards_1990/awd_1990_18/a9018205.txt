Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Dr.  Honzatko proposes to carry out x-ray crystallographic                     
              investigations which will reveal the structural basis for the                  
              mechanisms of catalysis and inhibition of adenylosuccinate                     
              synthetase from Escherichia coli, the enzyme which governs the                 
              first committed step in the de novo synthesis of adenine                       
              nucleotides.  The synthetase from E. coli may be the first                     
              enzyme of the purine biosynthetic pathway for which a high                     
              resolution crystal structure will be available.  Furthermore,                  
              the synthetase is a prime example of an important class of                     
              enzme involved in ternary reactions.  Indeed, adenylosuccinate                 
              synthetase is a guanosine triphosphate (GTP) hydrolyase which                  
              is either distantly related to GTP binding proteins of mammals                 
              or represents an altogehter distinct class of  GTP hydrolyses.                 
                                                                                             
              Two different crystal forms of adenlylosuccinate synthetase                    
              have been obtained and are under investigation .  The complex                  
              of the enzyme with succinate and the complex with succinate,                   
              inosine monophosphate and magnesium guanosine diphosphate.                     
              Studies of these two crystal forms will reveal the details of                  
              substrate-enzyme interactions and the conformational changes                   
              induced in the synthetase by the binding of substrates and                     
              substrate analogues.  Additional structural investigations are                 
              planned as well, specifically of the complex of the antibiotic                 
              hadacidin with the first crystalline form and several mutant                   
              forms of the enzyme.
