Abstract    :
                   This award provides one-half the funding for the acquisition              
              of an automated electron probe microanalyzer to be installed and               
              operated in the Materials Characterization Laboratory of the                   
              College of Earth and Mineral Sciences at the Pennsylvania State                
              University. Penn State University is committed to providing the                
              remaining half of the funding required.                                        
                   Major users of the microanalyzer will include staff and                   
              students of the departments of Geosiences, Metallurgy, Minerals                
              Processing and Fuel Sciences. The need to accurately characterize              
              chemical composition of both natural and synthetic solids with a               
              spatial resolution of micrometers is a requirement that runs common            
              to many of the sponsored research projects at the College of Earth             
              and Mineral Sciences.
