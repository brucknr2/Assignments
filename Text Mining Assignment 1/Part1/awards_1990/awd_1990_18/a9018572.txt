Abstract    :
              The main objective of this proposed research is to develop and test            
              optical fiber strain and stress sensor systems for on-line,                    
              accurate, and real-time monitoring of critical components of                   
              structural systems under service load conditions.                              
                                                                                             
              In this proposed research the combined resources of Rutgers' Civil             
              Engineering Department and those of its center for Fiber Optic                 
              Material Research Program (FOMRP) will be devoted for development              
              and implementation of both discrete and continuous optical fiber               
              strain / stress sensors for detection and warning of imminent                  
              structural failures for both concrete, and steel structures.  In               
              the case of concrete structural components, the sensor system will             
              be evaluated under both embedded (internal) and exposed (external)             
              condition; where the latter is attached to existing structures and             
              the former is embedded in the structure during its construction.
