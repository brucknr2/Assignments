Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The aim of the study is to examine the mechanisms involved in                  
              regulating the stability of messenger RNAs (mRNA). An early focus              
              will be on the mechanism of RNA turnover and the enzymes involved,             
              using a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches.  The                
              model system will be the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and both              
              cytoplasmic and mitochondrial mRNA stabilities will be examined,               
              ultimately.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              The regulation of gene expression in eukaryotic organisms involves             
              the coordination of both initiation of transcription as well as RNA            
              processing at the post-transcriptional level.  This study is aimed             
              at elucidating the mechanism of RNA turnover and an understanding              
              of the enzymes that catalyze this significant process.
