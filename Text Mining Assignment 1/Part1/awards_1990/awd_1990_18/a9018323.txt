Abstract    :
              The principal investigator proposes to study the kinetics of                   
              hydrogen and majority point defects in olivine.  Experiments on                
              olivine will be carried out in order to determine the dependence               
              of hydrogen solubility on hydrogen fugacity.  Results, determined              
              from infrared spectroscopic data, will be used to understand the               
              mechanism by which hydrogen affects important internal properties              
              of olivine.  Additionally, coulometric titration measurements                  
              will be made to study the mobilities of the majority point                     
              defects in olivine, as well as the deviation in stoichiometry, as              
              a function of various thermodynamic parameters.  Ultimately all                
              studies will lead to the development of a point defect model for               
              olivine.  This in turn will be critical to understanding the                   
              behavior of olivine and, for example, to interpreting conditions               
              in the earth's mantle, as well as other geological environments.
