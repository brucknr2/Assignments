Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Dr. Wasserman is using genetic, molecular, and biochemical                     
              techniques to define the intracellular signalling pathway that                 
              establishes dorsoventral polarity in the Drosophila embryo.                    
              Initially, he has focussed his interests on the molecular                      
              analysis of two genes, tube and pelle. A cDNA clone for tube has               
              been identified by its ability to direct in vitro synthesis of                 
              RNA that, upon microinjection, can phenotypically rescue embryos               
              lacking tube activity. A cDNA clone for pelle will be obtained by              
              a similar route. Patterns of gene expression and of post                       
              translational modification will be characterized as a means of                 
              exploring the mechanism of signal transduction. Deduced                        
              functional sites and domains in the tube and pelle proteins will               
              be disrupted by mutations engineered in the cDNA sequences;                    
              transcripts generated in vitro from the altered cDNAs will then                
              be assayed for activity in the microinjection bioassay. Existing               
              or newly induced mutations for each gene will be used to generate              
              null allele combinations for phenotypic analysis. Lastly, gel                  
              filtration chromatography and immunoblotting will be used to look              
              for stable interactions that may define functional modules in the              
              signalling pathway.
