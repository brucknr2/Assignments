Abstract    :
                   This work will develop a generalized three-dimensional model              
              for the interaction of normal and strike-slip faults during                    
              continental extension.  The relationship between transverse                    
              structures (strike-slip faults) and detachment (normal) faults in              
              southern Nevada will be examined in detail, and a temporal and                 
              structural history will be established.  To accomplish this, an                
              integrated study will be conducted that involves geologic mapping,             
              geochronology, and seismic reflection profiling across both                    
              detachment and strike-slip faults.  This collaborative proposal                
              with 9017629 which will address the geologic mapping and                       
              geochronology.  Three classes of models will be tested:                        
              strike-slip faults ar crust-penetrating, fundamental first order               
              structures and normal faults are secondary; detachment faults are              
              first-order structures and strike-slip faults are secondary                    
              transfer faults in the shallow crust; and, strike-slip and normal              
              faults are synchronous and allow extension to occur by the                     
              horizontal translation of crustal blocks.  The results of this                 
              study will provide fundamental three-dimensional information on                
              the mechanisms by which continental crust may extend, and as such              
              have wide-reaching tectonic importance.
