Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Constraining the magnitudes of stresses in the earth's crust              
              if fundamental to a broad range of problems of lithospheric                    
              mechanics.  The plan to drill and core to 10 km depth by the KTB               
              project of West Germany represents the first opportunity to                    
              measure in situ stress magnitudes at seismogenic depth in                      
              continental crust.                                                             
                   Conventional stress measurement techniques cannot be                      
              employed in the KTB main borehole, or most other deep boreholes.               
              Thus, this project is aimed at development of a novel integrated               
              stress measurement strategy for eventual use to 10 km depth in                 
              the KTB borehole and other deep holes, such as those that exist                
              in the Soviet Union.  There are four main  activities associated               
              with developing and implementing the proposed stress measurement               
              strategy:  Making detailed observations of breakouts and thermal               
              fractures in the borehole, development of sufficiently                         
              comprehensive theories of borehole failure, conducting                         
              comprehensive laboratory tests on core and making least principal              
              stress measurements utilizing hydraulic fractures through                      
              perforations in the casing.  This research is being done in                    
              collaboration with Prof. Karl Fuchs of the University of                       
              Karlsruhe and Prof. Fritz Rummel of  Ruhr University-Bochum.                   
              Laboratory strength measurements of core samples will be done in               
              collaboration with Dr. James Byerlee of the U.S. Geological                    
              Survey.
