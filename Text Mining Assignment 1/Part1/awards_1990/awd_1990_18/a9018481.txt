Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Recent evidence suggests that the alpha-subunit of the Na-pump has             
              glycan moieties exposed to the cytosolic side of the plasma                    
              membrane of animal cells.  A novel aspect of these glycans is that             
              they are sensitive to peptide N-glycosidase F, a phenomenon not                
              previously noted, and suggestive of a topology that can not be                 
              explained by current notions of glycoprotein biosynthesis and                  
              insertion into plasma membrane.  This project is aimed at                      
              elucidating this topology by describing the structure and                      
              composition of the glycans, determining where in the cell they are             
              synthesized and attached to protein, and establishing to which                 
              amino acid(s) of the Na-pump the sugar molecules are bound.  These             
              studies may be expected to lead to an understanding of how it is               
              that the carbohydrate moieties of the glycoproteins become                     
              positioned on the cytosolic side of the membrane.                              
                                                                                             
              The finding of an apparently novel topography of the Na-pump that              
              plays a key role in the functions of cell membranes raises                     
              fundamental questions about the chemical nature of this particular             
              membrane glycoprotein and the site and means by which the                      
              glycosylation occurs.  The research planned is aimed at enlarging              
              our understanding both of protein glycosylation and the role of                
              oligosaccharides in membrane glycoprotein functions.
