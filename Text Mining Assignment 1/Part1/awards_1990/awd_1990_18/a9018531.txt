Abstract    :
                   This award provides 56% of the funds required for the                     
              acquisition of a computer system required for the research of the              
              geophysics faculty in the Department of Physics at New Mexico State            
              University. The University is committed to providing the remaining             
              funds needed for the acquisition.                                              
                   The computer system will allow the researchers to address                 
              computationally intensive problems such as the propagation of                  
              elastic waves in heterogeneous media, travel-time inversion from               
              earthquake data, and other research projects in computational and              
              observational seismology, potential field studies, paleomagnetism,             
              and neotectonics.
