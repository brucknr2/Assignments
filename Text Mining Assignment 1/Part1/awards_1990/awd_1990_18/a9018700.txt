Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              The long range goal of the proposed research is to                             
              understand the role of intercellular communication in                          
              regulating adenohypophyseal cell function.  To                                 
              investigate this issue, initial studies will elucidate the                     
              relationship between somatotroph function and topography                       
              of Growth Hormone (GH) and other cell types in individual                      
              tissue slices.  Basal and stimulated GH release will be                        
              measured from sections placed in perifusion; subsequently,                     
              tissue slices will be processed for routine histological                       
              examination.  Serial (adjacent) paraffin sections obtained                     
              from each tissue slice will be stained                                         
              immunocytochemically for GH, ACTH, TSH, LH/FSH, PRL and                        
              the S-100 protein.  Distributions of these cell types,                         
              assessed by image analysis, will be correlated with GH                         
              secretory profiles.  These studies are based on the                            
              hypothesis that differential GH release from tissue                            
              sections is the result of specific neighboring cells                           
              influencing somatotroph function via cell-to-cell                              
              communication.  A second component of the project will                         
              identify to what extent cell-to-cell contact affects                           
              somatotroph function.
