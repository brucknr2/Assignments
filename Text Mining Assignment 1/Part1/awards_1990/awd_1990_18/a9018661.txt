Abstract    :
                   This award provides 50% of the funds required for the                     
              acquisition of a computer file server system required for the                  
              research of the seismology group in the Department of Earth and                
              Planetary Sciences at Harvard University. The University is                    
              committed to providing the remaining funds needed for the                      
              acquisition.                                                                   
                   The computer system will allow the researchers to address a               
              broad range of problems dealing with the interpretation of data                
              from globally distributed digital seismographic stations to arrive             
              at the Earth's three-dimensional internal structure from its crust             
              to the core.
