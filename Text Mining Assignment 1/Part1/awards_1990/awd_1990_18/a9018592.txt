Abstract    :
              The PIs propose to: (1) determine Pb, Sr, and Nd isotopes on the               
              geochemically well-characterized samples from their                            
              reconnaissance study, (2) collect additional samples on Lanai                  
              from thicker sections of lava, and collect glass from dikes, (3)               
              analyze these additional samples for major and trace elements,                 
              and selected samples for isotopic compositions, and (4) analyze                
              selected samples from the reconnaissance study and from                        
              additional field work for mineral chemistry.  Samples from a                   
              thick stratigraphic section will allow examination of the                      
              temporal, geochemical and isotopic evolution of Lanai.
