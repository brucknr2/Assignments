Abstract    :
              The College of Engineering at the University of Maryland College Park          
              is establishing seven fellowships to recruit women, minorities, and/or         
              persons with disabilities.  Five departments in the College that will          
              participate in this program are aerospace; chemical, nuclear and               
              materials; civil; electrical; and mechanical engineering.   The Dean of        
              Engineering has appointed a Project Director to head this effort.  The         
              program will be administered by a committee made up of faculty members         
              and administrators.  The College, through the Graduate School, will            
              provide matching funds for seven fellowships; and the Dean of                  
              Engineering has made commitments to continue the effort after NSF              
              support ends by setting aside fifteen graduate assistantships or               
              fellowships.
