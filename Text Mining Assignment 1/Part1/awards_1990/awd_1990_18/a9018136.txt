Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The 34S-enrichment of arc volcanics relative to Mid-Ocean Basalt               
              and the heterogeneity of mantle values of delta-S34 have been                  
              ascribed to contributions from subducted ocenaic crust. Recent                 
              work by the Dr. Alt has shown, however, that altered oceanic                   
              crust by itself cannot account for these observations. He plans                
              to look for these sources of sulfur and its isotopes in the                    
              sediments that are carried into the trench along with igneous                  
              basement rocks. He will examine the entire pelagic column and its              
              pore waters at 3 sites from Leg 129 of the Ocean Drilling Program              
              in the western Pacific, define the sulfur budget within the                    
              sediment column, and determine the effects of low-temperature                  
              metamorphism on sulfur in the uppermost crust.
