Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The progression of activated (G1-phase) T cells into S-phase, and              
              ultimately, mitosis is initiated by the binding of the T cell-                 
              derived growth factor, interleukin 2 (IL2) to high affinity cell               
              surface receptors.  At present, the intracellular pathways involved            
              in the propagation of mitogenic signals in IL2-stimulated T cells              
              are unknown.  Although the IL2 receptor does not contain an                    
              intrinsic protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) domain, IL2 receptor                   
              occupancy stimulates the phosphorylation of intracellular proteins             
              at tyrosyl residues.  The long-term goal of this project is to                 
              define the mechanism by which ligand-stimulated IL2 receptors                  
              initiate and propagate growth-regulatory signals from the plasma               
              membrane to the nucleus.  The present study will utilize                       
              homogeneous populations of IL2-responsive, murine and human T cells            
              to address the following specific aims:  (1) To further define the             
              interactions of the ligand-bound IL2 receptor with various non-                
              receptor PTKs normally expressed in T cells.  (2) To characterize              
              IL2 receptor signaling functions and growth factor sensitivities               
              in a panel of T cell clones transfected with genes (p60c-src,                  
              polyomavirus middle T antigen) whose protein products alter PTK                
              activity in these cells.                                                       
                                                                                             
              These studies will provide novel insights into the interactions of             
              receptors for hormone-like "cytokines" with non-receptor enzymes,              
              PTKs, and into the role of protein tyrosine phosphorylation in                 
              signal transduction leading to proliferation of specific cells of              
              the immune system.
