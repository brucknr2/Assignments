Abstract    :
              This award is the result of the NSF initiative on QNDE of Large                
              Structural Systems.  The objective is to demonstrate the use of                
              magnetic hysteresis and Barkhausen measurement technologies in                 
              establishing the safety of steel components in large railroad                  
              bridges from a practical viewpoint.  In particular the growth of               
              fatigue cracks will be emphasized.
