Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will study the intrusion of alkali                  
              olivine basalt dikes into limestones at Killala Bay, Ireland.                  
              The nature and extent of fluid-rock interactions will be                       
              determined from measured reaction progress, supplemented by                    
              stable isotope analyses.  Rates of fluid generation and transport              
              will be quantified with thermal history models.  Numerical models              
              of the intrusion will be used to quantitatively analyze grain                  
              coarsening of several minerals, as well as the kinetics of                     
              grossularite nucleation and growth, and to provide a timescale                 
              for fluid production and interaction.  The study will help                     
              geologists understand the influence of fluids, and the                         
              metamorphic kinetics, associated with the intrusions of igneous                
              rocks.
