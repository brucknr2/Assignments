Abstract    :
              The meiotic pathway, way which diploid cells are converted to                  
              haploids, is the fundamental mode of sexual reproduction for                   
              eucaryotic organisms.  This award focuses on a key regulatory                  
              decision made during meiosis in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.            
              Yeast cells can initiate meiosis without being committed to its                
              completions; that is, they retain the ability to directly re-enter             
              the mitotic cell cycle while undergoing premeiotic DNA synthesis               
              and meiotic recombination.  However, this ability is lost prior to             
              the first meiotic division: cells which proceed beyond pachytene               
              (a substage of prophase I) may re-enter the vegetative cell cycle              
              only following completion of meiosis and the formation of viable               
              spores.  The stage of commitment is analogous to the point of                  
              oocyte maturation in higher eucaryotes.  Our ultimate goal is to               
              understand the mechanism (s) by which a cell becomes committed to              
              the completion of meiosis.  To this end, a genetic search for                  
              components of the regulatory network underlying the decision has               
              been initiated.  We anticipate that these will include components              
              of both the signal transduction apparatus and the chromosome                   
              segregation apparatus.  Further characterization, combining                    
              genetic, molecular and cytological approaches, will reveal the                 
              functions of individual genes and identify components which                    
              interact directly with one another.  These studies will contribute             
              to the elucidation of a fundamental biological process at the                  
              molecular level.
