Abstract    :
              Three CAD design tools, produced in research projects at the                   
              University of Washington, are being developed and enhanced so as               
              to bring them into a state for distribution to general users.                  
              These tools are:  (1) MacTester, an interactive testing and                    
              debugging environment built around the Mackintosh computer; (2)                
              WireC, a mixed graphical and procedural language for describing                
              hardware systems; and (3) Gemini, a VLSI layout verification                   
              program that compares the circuit specification with the circuit               
              layout.                                                                        
                   This grant is made under the Software Capitalization Program.
