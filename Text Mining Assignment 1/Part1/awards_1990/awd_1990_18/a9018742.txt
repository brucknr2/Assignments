Abstract    :
              This award supports an investigation of the early seafloor                     
              spreading history of the Marie Byrd Land Margin, Antarctica.                   
              This effort will carefully map the magnetic lineations, the                    
              gravity anomalies, the topography and, where possible, the                     
              seismically determined depth to basement.  The study will                      
              integrate the tectonic lineations determined from the                          
              gravity, bathymetry and seismic information with the                           
              magnetic anomalies to construct a new seafloor spreading                       
              history of the Marie Byrd Land Margin.                                         
                                                                                             
              The analysis of these new data sets and the resultant                          
              seafloor spreading history will be used to address the                         
              following questions:  (1) Did the early opening of the                         
              Pacific-Antarctic Ridge involve an additional plate, the                       
              Bellingshausen Plate, or did the ridge undergo very                            
              asymmetric, non-orthogonal spreading?  (2) With a better                       
              refined opening history for the Pacific Antarctic Ridge,                       
              what are the implications for relative motions between the                     
              tectonic blocks which compromise West Antarctica and for the                   
              structure and evolution of the Marie Byrd Land Margin?                         
              (3) Can the global plate circuit solution be enhanced by                       
              refining the early Tertiary history of Pacific-Antarctic                       
              seafloor spreading?
