Abstract    :
                   The PI will continue his work on high precision dating of                 
              carbonates and marine geochemistry of rare earth elements with                 
              multiple objectives in mind, including:  the determination of                  
              chronology of marine carbonates of the past 400 K years; marine                
              terraces and their relationship to sea-level changes; isotopic                 
              chemistry of pore waters and the effect of diagenesis on U-Th                  
              chronometer; abundance of Platinum and Silver in seawater; and                 
              geochemistry of Nd, U and Th.  The work will help refine the C-14              
              time scale and the chronology of sea-level changes of the recent               
              past.
