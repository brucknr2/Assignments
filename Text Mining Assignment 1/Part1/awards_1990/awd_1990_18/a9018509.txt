Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The long term goal of this work is to delineate the factors                    
              which control electron transfer in biological systems                          
              specifically in cytochromes c and b5.  (1) The role of protein                 
              surface charges will be evaluated by studying cytochromes with                 
              altered electrostatic surfaces.  (2) The rate constant for                     
              electron transfer is thought to decrease exponentially with                    
              distance; this distance dependence may in turn be a function                   
              of the driving force for the reaction.  Dr. Dixon will make a                  
              series of cytochromes b5. with increasing steric bulk at the                   
              electron transfer site.  Rate constants at different driving                   
              forces will be measured.  The resulting matrix of rate                         
              constants will be used to assess the dependence of electron                    
              transfer on distance and driving force.  (3) Dr. Dixon will use                
              NMR techniques to measure both electron transfer rate constants                
              and protein motions for a series of cytochromes c in an effect                 
              to understand the molecular basis of conformational and                        
              reorganizational control of electron transfer.  Particular                     
              emphasis will be placed on the structure of cytochrome c as a                  
              function of ionic strength, on the kinetics of the reversible                  
              loss of the axial methionine and on the roles of residues near                 
              the heme in controlling electron transfer.
