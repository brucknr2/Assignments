Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The molecular properties and the regulation of the carriers                    
              involved in the sodium cycle of extremely alkaliphilic bacteria are            
              the focus of the research planned.  Transposon mutagenesis will be             
              used to identify genes of Bacillus firmus OF4 that encode the                  
              Na+/H+ antiporter or its regulatory genes.  This approach, coupled             
              with analysis of gene sequences, should provide a key initial step             
              in the definition of these antiporters characteristic of extreme               
              alkaliphiles and permit rigorous testing of hypotheses about the               
              functioning of such antiporters.                                               
                                                                                             
              Bacteria which thrive under alkaliphilic conditions carry out a                
              cycling of sodium using proton pumps.  The molecular properties of,            
              and the regulation of, the carriers involved in the unusal,                    
              membrane-related events of these bacteria will be studied and                  
              should lead to a more complete understanding of the functioning of             
              these carriers in extreme alkaliphiles.
