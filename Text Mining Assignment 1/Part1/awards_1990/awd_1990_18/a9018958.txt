Abstract    :
                   Late Pleistocene small mammal faunas from North America are               
              used extensively as proxies for climate changes during the last                
              20,000 years.  The dominant characteristic regarding these                     
              Pleistocene biotas is their high species diversity, the existence              
              of non-analog communities (disharmonious faunas), and the                      
              individualistic response of species to regional climate change.                
                   Because the concept of disharmonious faunas is critical to                
              modeling climate change and the development of biotic communities,             
              this hypothesis must be tested quantitatively---by accelerator mass            
              spectrometry (AMS)  C dating of individual fossil species that are             
              now allopatric.  The goal is to AMS  C date  140 fossils from three            
              stratified caves along an environmental transect:  Hall's Cave,                
              Texas; Peccary Cave, Arkansas; and Baker Bluff Cave, Tennessee.                
              In addition, approximately 20 pairs of disharmonious fossil species            
              from single-component sites will be added to the data set.  The                
               C dates will 1) evaluate if disharmonious assemblages are natural             
              occurrences, 2) provide chronologies for species migrations and 3)             
              will improve significantly the chronologies for biotic changes                 
              during the past 20,000 years.  Ultimately, the  C dating will                  
              provide quantitative data on background levels of faunal change--              
              data presently unavailable to ecologists.
