Abstract    :
              With the appearance of depleted springtime ozone abundances  over              
              Antarctica there has been much concern over the impact of enhanced             
              ultraviolet radiation on the region's ecology.  Dr. Gautier                    
              proposes to develop a method for mapping biologically active                   
              ultraviolet (UV-B) and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR)               
              falling on the Antarctic and the surrounding Southern Ocean.                   
              Satellite remote sensing techniques, validated with surface                    
              measurements from NSF's UV monitoring program at specific Antarctic            
              sites, will extend the geographical mapping of ozone and UV                    
              radiation over Antarctica. The project will place special emphasis             
              on the period of springtime ozone depletion.  Atmospheric data will            
              be collected to develop a thorough understanding of solar radiation            
              transfer in the Antarctic earth-atmosphere system.  Moreover, this             
              information will be used to modify for high-latitude work the                  
              satellite remote sensing algorithms already developed by Dr.                   
              Gautier for surface radiation budget studies at lower latitudes.               
              The results of this project will be maps of surface UV-B and PAR               
              irradiance having 50 kilometer resolution which are comparable to              
              maps of stratospheric ozone abundance using satellite remote                   
              sensing.
