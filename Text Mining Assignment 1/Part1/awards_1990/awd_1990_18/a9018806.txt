Abstract    :
              Understanding the basic physical characteristics of fluids in                  
              hydrothermal systems is critical in modelling fluid flow in such               
              environments and in characterizing the extent and depth of                     
              crustal alteration produced by high temperature fluids. The                    
              present award will support the development of new instrumentation              
              to measure temperature, pressure and electrical resistivity of                 
              fluids in high temperature systems. This instrumentation will                  
              play an important role in understanding fluid flow in both marine              
              and continental environments and should be an important                        
              contribution to documenting the basic physical environment in                  
              boreholes.
