Abstract    :
                   This project will examine the deformation behavior of a                   
              series of two-phase aggregates of mantle minerals under well                   
              constrained thermodynamic conditions, starting with the olivine-               
              orthopyroxene system, and focusing on the effect of the relative               
              concentration so the two components on the overall strength of                 
              the aggregate.  Experiments will be performed under conditions                 
              favoring deformation by dislocation creep in the constituent                   
              minerals.  Detailed microstructural investigations using scanning              
              and transmission electron microscopy will check for any                        
              microcracking and to investigate the nature and relative                       
              contributions of the creep mechanisms in the individual minerals.              
              The experiments will also provide some insight into how the                    
              individual deformation mechanisms and slip systems, measured in                
              single crystal studies, can be recast into the behavior of an                  
              aggregate.
