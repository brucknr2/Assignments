Abstract    :
                   This award provides 50% funding of the costs associated with              
              the machining and assembly of a multi-anvil high-pressure apparatus            
              that will be used in research projects in the Department of Earth,             
              Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences at the Massachusetts Institute              
              of Technology. MIT is committed to providing the remaining funds               
              needed. The apparatus will employ an "octahedron-within-a-                     
              cube" design for the nested pressure chambers of the multi-anvil               
              system and will be capable of high-temperature experiments in the              
              pressure range up to 20 GPa (200 kilobars). The apparatus will be              
              employed primarily in high-pressure experiments on melting                     
              phenomena relevant to the chemical differentiation of the Earth's              
              mantle.
