Abstract    :
              An accurate and continuous chronology does not exist for the                   
              loess and tephra overlying the 140ka-old Old Crow tephra and                   
              underlying the oldest C-14 dated (ca 35ka) beds in central                     
              Alaska.  The relevant stratigraphic units (Goldstream Formation                
              and equivalent loess, and underlying upper Gold Hill Loess) are                
              dominantly loess with interbedded discontinuous tephra and some                
              organic layers.  The lack of accurate deposition ages for these                
              sediments in the time period ca. 30-140ka makes interpretation of              
              the local and regional paleoenvironmental and paleontological                  
              records ambiguous.  This proposal therefore seeks to develop the               
              first firm chronology for these sediments in this time range by                
              thermoluminescence (TL) dating of the widespread loess and                     
              occasional interbedded tephra from 5 sites near Fairbanks.                     
              Additional laboratory equipment is also requested to permit the                
              efficient execution of this and other TL dating projects in this               
              laboratory.  This research will demonstrate the reliability of TL              
              dating and obtain TL dates of Holocene and Wisconsin loess and                 
              tephra in a key geologic area of Alaska.
