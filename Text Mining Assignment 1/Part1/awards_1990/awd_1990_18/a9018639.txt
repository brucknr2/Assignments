Abstract    :
              This project is designed to test whether Cu and other chemical                 
              components are leached from wallrock during deep sodic-calcic                  
              alteration in the Yerington porphyry.  It will involve geologic                
              mapping and petrologic phase equilibria studies of sodic-calcic                
              alteration.  S, Sr, O, and Nd isotopic compositions in fresh and               
              altered rocks will be used as tracers to constrain whether these               
              fluids and components originated inside or outside the batholith.              
              Integration of volumes of alteration and gains or losses should                
              yield a mass-balance estimate of wallrock leaching of Cu, Fe, Zn,              
              Au, K, and other components and allow assessment of their                      
              contribution to the Cu ore body.
