Abstract    :
              The evolution of red supergiant stars to white dwarfs through the              
              "planetary nebula nucleus" (PPN) stage occurs very quickly and is              
              therefore one of the most poorly understood stages of stellar                  
              evolution.  It is also a very important stage.  It is during this              
              time that a star returns many of the intermediate-weight elements              
              (such as carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen) into interstellar space,                
              from which new generations of stars are eventually formed once                 
              again.  The PI proposes a program first, to identify new PPN                   
              candidates and, second, to determine their spectral energy                     
              distributions.  This information will be used ultimately to infer              
              the distribution of ages and thereby to do a sensitve "census" of              
              their properties as they evolve through this brief phase.  This                
              study requires a great deal of data analysis and reduction,                    
              preferably on a dedicated computer.  This award will support the               
              purchase of a workstation to perform these tasks.
