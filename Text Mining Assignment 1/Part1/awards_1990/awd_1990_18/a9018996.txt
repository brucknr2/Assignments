Abstract    :
              The principal investigators will attempt to determine controls of              
              element mobility as a function of metamorphic grade by studying                
              boron partitioning between minerals, mass balance whole-rock                   
              trace element compositions, zoning of trace elements in minerals,              
              and correlations between trace element compositions of                         
              progressive metamorphic suites.  Work will involve the identity                
              of minerals that contain boron, and certain other trace elements,              
              as well as whole-rock characterizations for additional fluid-                  
              mobile elements. Results will be applied to subduction zone                    
              metamorphism and the evolution of arc magmas.  This research will              
              help geologists understand important chemical processes deep                   
              within the earth.
