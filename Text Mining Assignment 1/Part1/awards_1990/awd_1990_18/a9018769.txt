Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                  Understanding basin geometry and its relationship to the                  
              sedimentary record is critical for the development and testing of              
              rifting models.  Seismic imaging, combined with drill hole data                
              and surface geology,provides one of the best methods for                       
              understanding this relationship.  The purpose of this project is               
              to use recently released seismic data from the Newark basin.  The              
              studies to be under taken deal with establishing the relationship              
              of units imaged in the seismic profiles to units known at the                  
              surface, establishing the nature of units known only in the                    
              subsurface, determining the three-dimensional structure, and                   
              working out the relationship between faulting, subsidence, and                 
              sedimentation.
