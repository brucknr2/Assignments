Abstract    :
              With this award, the Chemistry Division is supporting efforts                  
              in the area of curriculum development by sponsoring a two-day                  
              workshop for the 51 current chemistry Research Experience for                  
              Undergraduate (REU) Site directors and interested persons from                 
              the Foundation.   The aims of the workshop, to be held at the                  
              Foundation during September 19-21, 1990, are: 1) to discuss the                
              role of chemistry research in the undergraduate curriculum and                 
              in the students' career choices, 2) to assess the impact of the                
              REU Program on undergraduate education, on subsequent                          
              enrollment in graduate chemistry-related research programs and                 
              on ultimate career decisions, 3) to formulate specific                         
              proposals for the enhancement and increased effectiveness of                   
              the REU Program and the operation of individual sites, and 4)                  
              to develop strategies for expanding the visibility of the                      
              Program.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              The concrete results of the workshop will be 1) a "White Paper"                
              summarizing the conclusions of the workshop, a document which                  
              will serve in part to advise those at the Foundation who are                   
              involved in the REU Program, 2) a set of guidelines for REU                    
              site directors, and 3) plans for a future symposium at a                       
              National Meeting of the American Chemical Society dealing with                 
              undergraduate research and the REU Program.  It is anticiupated                
              that the overall impact of the workshop will be an improvement                 
              in opportunities for direct student exposure to research and an                
              increase in the number of people opting for research careers.
