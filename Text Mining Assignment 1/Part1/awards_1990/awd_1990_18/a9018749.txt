Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Flower development remains one of the most interesting and                     
              complex processes unique to plants, and yet little is known about              
              the molecular mechanisms involved. Dr. Yanofsky has cloned one of              
              the genes, Agamous (AG), that plays a key role in determining the              
              correct pattern of floral organs in Arabidopsis thaliana.                      
              Mutations in the AG gene result in a "double flower" phenotype.                
              Similar phenotypes have been described in other plants for as                  
              much as two thousand years, making this the oldest recognized                  
              flower abnormality. Dr. Yanofsky's goal over the next three to                 
              five years is to begin  to dissect the complex regulatory network              
              that allows the expression of the AG gene to be controlled such                
              that expression occurs in a precise spacial and temporal manner.               
              This will be achieved through a detailed characterization of the               
              cis acting elements involved in regulation the expression of AG,               
              and by identifying the sequences within the AG promoter to which               
              trans acting regulatory factors bind. In addition, since the data              
              suggest that the Agamous protein is a sequence specific DNA                    
              binding protein that regulates genes involved in stamen and                    
              carpel formation, he will directly test the ability of AGamous to              
              recognize specific DNA sequences. In addition, by manipulating                 
              the expression of Agamous in transgenic plants, he will directly               
              test predictions of a model for flower development that has thus               
              far been based entirely on genetic data.
