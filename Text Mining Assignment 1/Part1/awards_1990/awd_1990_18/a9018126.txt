Abstract    :
                   A basin analysis of the Skeena group of west-central British              
              Columbia will be undertaken to evaluate Early Cretaceous tectonics             
              and mechanics of terrane collision.  The model to be tested is that            
              initial terrane collision resulted in the mergence of two                      
              subduction zones and uplift of the Late Jurassic to earlier                    
              Cretaceous Skeena Arch.  Progressive collision led to the expansion            
              of the arch behind an active arc to the west.  The arch subsided               
              in the Early Cretaceous and the Skeena Group were deposited in the             
              back-arc basin.  The two hypotheses that this study will address               
              are (1) back arc subsidence was the result of extension or                     
              transtension, or (2) subsidence was due to shortening, tectonic                
              loading and lithospheric flexure.  Distinguishing criteria will                
              include sediment provenance, facies analysis, subsidence history,              
              paleocurrent analysis, diagenetic history, and trace element                   
              geochemistry of interbedded volcanics.  The results of this study              
              will have important implications for the evolution of the Jurassic-            
              Cretaceous Pacific basin and the Farallon plate.
