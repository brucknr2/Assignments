Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The biogeochemistry of H.2S and OCS in the oxic ocean will be                  
              examined with the objectives (1) to elucidate specific production              
              mechanisms (e.g., for H.2S; OCS hydrolysis, photosynthetic                     
              production for OCS; photolysis of dissolved organic sulfur                     
              compounds, organic matter regeneration), (2) to evaluate the                   
              interactions of H.2S and trace metals, (3) to quantify the sea.air             
              exchange of H.2S, and (4) to examine the sources and long range                
              transport of H.2S and OCS in the major thermocline of the Sargasso             
              Sea.  These objectives will be met through field sampling,                     
              cooperative studies with trace metal and atmospheric researchers,              
              and laboratory.based experiments.
