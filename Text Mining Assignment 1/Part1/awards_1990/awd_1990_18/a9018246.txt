Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Florida Museum of Natural History holds extremely valuable                 
              anthropology and zooarchaeology collections.  These are widely                 
              used in anthropological research, and the latter, which include                
              large numbers of faunal specimens, constitutes a significant                   
              national resource.  Analysts working with archaeologically                     
              recovered animal and fish bones turn regularly to these materials              
              of known species and origin for reference.  The Florida State                  
              Museum plans to move these materials this summer to a new compact              
              storage system.  To prevent damage of fragile specimens during                 
              this move and to guard against mixing, it is important that                    
              careful packing is done, and National Science Foundation funds                 
              will be used for this purpose.                                                 
                                                                                             
              This work is important because the anthropological specimens are               
              used by a large number of researchers and should be made                       
              available in a maximally efficient manner.
