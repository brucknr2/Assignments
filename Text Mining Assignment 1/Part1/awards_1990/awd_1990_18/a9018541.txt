Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Work just completed has shown that the isotopic fractionation                  
              accompanying photosynthetic fixation of carbon by marine algae                 
              can be related to the concentration of dissolved CO.2 in                     
              surface waters.  Specifically, during the past 100 kyr, the                    
              carbon.isotopic difference between planktonic foraminiferal                  
              carbonate and C.37 diunsaturated ketones produced by                         
              coccolithophorid algae has varied in proportion to the partial                 
              pressure of CO.2 in the atmosphere.  This phenomenon can be                  
              understood in terms of the molecular processes involved in                     
              carbon fixation, and it is the goal of this work to determine                  
              whether a consistent quantitative relationship between CO.2                  
              levels (oceanic and atmospheric) and isotopic fractionation can                
              be established.  If so, it should be possible to define a                      
              "paleobarometer" for CO.2 and to examine the variation of                    
              levels of this important greenhouse gas over tens, if not                      
              hundreds, of millions of years of earth history.
