Abstract    :
                   This award provides 50% funding for the development of a                  
              logging tool for temperature versus depth measurements in deep and             
              hot drillholes. The logging tool will be developed by the PI in the            
              Department of Geological Sciences at Southern Methodist University.            
              SMU is committed to providing the rest of the funding required for             
              this project.                                                                  
                   Use of present equipment to measure heat flow through the                 
              Earth's crust is severely limited in depth and temperature, mainly             
              because of the use of electric cabling to transmit back to the                 
              surface. Consequently, few research quality temperature logging                
              tools can be used at more than 450K and 3 kilometers. This project             
              will adapt downhole computer and cryogenic technology to develop               
              a temperature logging tool that is more accurate than existing ones            
              and capable of operating up to 650K and 5 kilometers. Such                     
              measurements are needed to interpret the heat flow from the                    
              interior and its role in the Earth's thermal budget.
