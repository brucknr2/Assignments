Abstract    :
                   This award provides 50% of the funds needed to assemble a                 
              laser fluorination extraction line for the analysis of oxygen                  
              isotopes in small samples. The extraction system will be installed             
              in the Division of Geological and Planetary Sciences at the                    
              California Institute of Technology. Caltech is committed to                    
              providing the remaining 50% necessary to acquire the laser source.             
                   The equipment will be used by Caltech geochemists to analyze              
              the oxygen isotope composition of small mineral samples from                   
              terrestrial igneous and metamorphic rocks, ore deposits, and                   
              meteorites. The technique involves laser heating of silicates in               
              a reaction chamber that contains the sample and a fluorinating                 
              agent. The reaction produces oxygen for isotopic analysis with high            
              sensitivity and excellent spatial resolution and allows the                    
              solution of geological problems such as the multiple timing of vein            
              mineralization, isotopic zoning of mineral grains, and the                     
              explanation of hydrothermal effects in and around crystallizing                
              magma bodies.
