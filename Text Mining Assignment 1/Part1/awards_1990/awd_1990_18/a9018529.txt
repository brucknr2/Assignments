Abstract    :
              The University-National Laboratory System (UNOLS) fleet of                     
              research vessels, operated by academic institutions, provides                  
              support services to those NSF sponsored researchers who require                
              time at sea to complete their investigations.  All of these ships              
              use oceanographic cable as part of this research support.                      
              Arrangements have been made which allow bulk purchases of cable                
              resulting in considerable cost savings.                                        
                                                                                             
              Sixteen reels of cable will be purchased.  The cable is stored                 
              until needed by ship operators at the Woods Hole Oceanographic                 
              Institution (WHOI) on the east coast and at the Scripps                        
              Institution of Oceanography on the west coast.                                 
                                                                                             
              Mr. Donald A. Moller, Marine Operations Coordinator, WHOI,                     
              will manage this project.
