Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This long-term study focuses on the ecological disturbances               
              to eastern Pacific coral reefs that accompanied the severe and                 
              historically unprecedented 1982-83 ENSO (El Nino-Southern                      
              Oscillation) event. During the first 3-year segment (1985-87) of               
              the study a strong causative link was established between                      
              prolonged sea warming and numerous kinds of primary disturbances.              
              During the first and second 3-year (1988-90) study periods the                 
              team of workers involved in this study have (a) demonstrated the               
              importance of several secondary (long-term) disturbance                        
              processes, (b) revealed the extent of recovery and continuing                  
              reef destruction to date, and (c) provided some indication of the              
              frequency of severe El Nino disturbances to coral reefs in an                  
              historical context. Because some important secondary                           
              disturbances are still occurring, and reef recovery has been slow              
              (Costa Rica, Panama) or non-existent (Galapagos Islands), it is                
              necessary to continue with this study in order to understand the               
              variety of changes involved and the full impact of a major                     
              disturbance on coral reef survival and the potential for                       
              continued reef building. ENSO warming disturbances can provide                 
              some clues to the probable changes in coral reefs worldwide if                 
              global warming causes repeated and/or protracted sea temperature               
              increases comparable to the 1982-83 El Nino event.
