Abstract    :
              This is an expedited award the goal of which                                   
              is the development of a set of exercises and                                   
              projects to be conducted on a modern desk-top                                  
              computer or workstation to significantly                                       
              improve the engineering educational process.                                   
              The proposed research will focus in the                                        
              engineering subject area of signal processing,                                 
              but the techniques that could be developed                                     
              will have broad applicability in engineering                                   
              education.  Six highly experienced faculty                                     
              members at five different universities will                                    
              collaborate in this research to organize,                                      
              write, test, and produce a book of exercises                                   
              for use with a normal signal processing                                        
              course.  These exercises will use the computer                                 
              in a fundamentally different way to utilize                                    
              the numerical and graphical power of the                                       
              computer together with a modern interactive                                    
              software system as the basis of an improve                                     
              engineering educational methodology.
