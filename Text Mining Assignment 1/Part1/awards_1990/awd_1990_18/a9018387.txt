Abstract    :
              In this project, the P.I. will study upper ocean variability and               
              thermohaline circulation in the region east of the Antilles                    
              Archipelago, using data obtained as part of the NOAA Sub-Tropical              
              Atlantic Climate Studies (STACS) program.  Data include shipboard              
              upper ocean currents from Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers,                  
              water density from Conductivity Temperature Depth profilers, and               
              absolute velocities from the PEGASUS profiler.
