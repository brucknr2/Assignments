Abstract    :
                   This award provides one-half the funding required for the                 
              acquisition of a computer system that will installed in the                    
              Department of Geology and Geophysics at Yale University and used               
              primarily by the seismology and geodynamics faculty and their                  
              students. Yale University is committed to providing the remaining              
              half of the funding.                                                           
                   The added computing power of the system will be applied to                
              problems of mantle rheology, convection in the Earth's core,                   
              seismic anisotropy modeling, free oscillations of the Earth, global            
              scale seismic tomography, and other computing-intensive geophysical            
              research projects.
