Abstract    :
              This is a project to study the transport, distribution and                     
              fate of chemical species in snow accumulations as they                         
              undergo metamorphism, melting and final release.  The                          
              research involves carrying out intermediate-scale and                          
              bench scale experiments of solute transport followed by                        
              field-tracer studies at a well-instrumented site to                            
              verify/confirm the mathematical solute-transport models.                       
              The investigator plans on conducting image processing of                       
              snow sections at the Center for Remote Sensing and                             
              Environmental Optics and plans to utilize laboratory                           
              facilities of the Sierra Nevada Aquatic Research                               
              Laboratory, operated by the University of California,                          
              Santa Barbara.  His research also involves collaboration                       
              with the U.S. Army Cold Regions Research and Engineering                       
              Laboratory in Hanover, New Hampshire.                                          
                                                                                             
              Results of the modeling, bench-scale and field studies are                     
              expected to improve our understanding of physical                              
              processes that control the movement of chemical solutes by                     
              water from melting snow.  The model expected to result                         
              from this research is expected to be utilized in                               
              developing strategies for predicting and managing the                          
              flush of acidic substances from accumulated deposits of                        
              snow.
