Abstract    :
                   The position of several blocks of continental crust during the            
              Permian-Triassic closure of the Gulf of Mexico- Caribbean region               
              are presently unconstrained, yet must be accommodated in any model.            
              This project will obtain paleomagnetic data from one of the larger             
              of these enigmatic central American Blocks- the Yucatan block                  
              presently exposed in Belize and Guatemala.  Paleopoles of late                 
              Paleozoic and Mesozoic strata may constrain the paleolatitude and              
              relative position of Yucatan during the existence of Pangea and the            
              incipient break up to form the Gulf/Caribbean region.
