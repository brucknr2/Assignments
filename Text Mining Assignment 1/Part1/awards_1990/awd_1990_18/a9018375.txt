Abstract    :
              This award is made as the starter grant increment of Dr.                       
              Jeffrey Moore's Postdoctoral Fellowship in Chemistry Award                     
              insupport of his research at the University of Michigan. The                   
              main thrust of Dr. Moore's research is the development of new                  
              polymerization strategies for synthesizing macromolecules that                 
              contain main group elements in their backbone. These                           
              macromolecules are valuable intermediates for ceramics and                     
              other novel solid-state materials.                                             
                                                                                             
              The initial approach will be the synthesis of bicyclic                         
              cyclohexadiene monomers containing main group elements. The                    
              objective of these studies is to identify systems which can                    
              catalytically eliminate the inorganic substituents by                          
              simultaneously extruding an aromatic fragment. These reactions                 
              may be initiated by either cationic or anionic reagents. Once                  
              systems have been identified, model reaction studies will be                   
              used to optimize molecular parameters relevant to this                         
              chemistry.
