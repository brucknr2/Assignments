Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Colicin E3 is a toxic protein secreted by certain strains of E.                
              coli in order to eliminate related strains of bacterial living                 
              in the same ecological niche.  Colicin E3 inactivates the                      
              protein biosynthetic machinery of the infected cell by nicking                 
              16S ribosomal RNA at a specific site.  Colicin E3 thus acts                    
              enzymatically as an endoribonuclease.  The producing organism                  
              is immune to the toxicity of its own colicin E3 by virtue of a                 
              "immunity protein" which binds to colicin E3 and thus renders                  
              it inactive.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              Dr. Shoham proposed a crystallographic structure determination                 
              of colicin E3 and its inhibitor, the immunity protein gain                     
              understanding at the molecular level of the ribonuclease action                
              of colicin E3 and its inhibition of immunity protein.  Detailed                
              knowledge of the enzyme-inhibitor interactions will also shed                  
              light on the structure of the ribosome at large, in the                        
              vicinity of the cutting site.  the immunity protein is one the                 
              very few known ribonuclease inhibitors.  Its three-dimensional                 
              structure may provide a basis for the design of other RNAse                    
              inhibitors with desired specificity.
