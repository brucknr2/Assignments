Abstract    :
                   Workshops in molecular evolution will be offered at the                   
              Marine Biological Laboratory at Woods Hole in 1991, 1992 and                   
              1993.  The goal is to provide an opportunity for organismal,                   
              evolutionary and population biologists to learn about the                      
              powerful tools of molecular biology while providing                            
              molecular/cell biologists with an enriched understanding of                    
              evolutionary theory.  Lectures exploring multiple approaches to                
              molecular evolution will be supplemented by a computer workshop                
              for the analysis of protein and genetic sequences.  The workshop               
              is designed for established investigators, college and university              
              professors, postdoctoral fellows, and graduate students from                   
              diverse biological fields.  The theoretical basis of comparative               
              sequence analysis and phylogenetic tree construction will be                   
              presented as well as lectures about the application of molecular               
              techniques to problems in ecology and population packages for                  
              analysis of molecular data on different computer systems                       
              including workstations, personal computers and large mainframes.               
              Guided by authors for phylogenetic software packages, the                      
              students will have the opportunity to compare different data                   
              analysis techniques for molecular data.
