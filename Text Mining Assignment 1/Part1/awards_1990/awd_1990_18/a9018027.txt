Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              The goal of this research is to study the mechanism of                         
              peptide transport in human small intestine using brush                         
              border membrane vesicles.  Presently, there is no                              
              information on the specificity and multiplicity of the                         
              peptide transport systems located on human small                               
              intestine.  The specific aims are:                                             
                                                                                             
              1. To determine total uptake of the peptide substrate.                         
                                                                                             
              2. To investigate the kinetics of peptide transport.                           
                                                                                             
              3. To classify the structural characteristics of the                           
                 peptide transporter.                                                        
                                                                                             
              The investigator proposes to conduct a series of                               
              experiments starting with the isolation of the human                           
              intestinal brush border membrane vesicles obtained from                        
              organ donations.  Uptake of labeled substrates will be                         
              determined by the rapid filtration method and hydrolysis                       
              of the peptides will be monitored using high performance                       
              liquid chromatography.  The simple diffusion component of                      
              the peptides will be determined by treating each peptide                       
              as a competitive inhibitor of its own mediated transport.                      
              Experiments will be conducted to determine the kinetic                         
              characteristics of peptide uptake.  Various dipeptides and                     
              tripeptides will be used as inhibitors in order to                             
              determine the specificity of transport.
