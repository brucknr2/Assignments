Abstract    :
                This grant supports travel for U.S. scientists to attend a                   
              symposium and field trip related to the Xianshuihe fault in                    
              Chengdu, China.  The symposium and field trip are a part of the                
              Protocol for Earthquake Studies between the PRC and the USGS/NSF.              
              The symposium was motivated by the importance of the Xianshuihe                
              fault both as a hazard and as the best analog in the world to the              
              most active coterminous US fault, the San Andreas.  Because slip               
              rates on the Xianshuihe may be up to 4 times those on the San                  
              Andreas, research results could be available in a much shorter                 
              time for fulfilling goals of the National Earthquake Hazard                    
              Reduction Program (NEHRP) of which NSF is a lead agency.  The                  
              Xianshuihe would serve as a highly desirable testing ground for                
              theories developed in San Andreas studies.  One of the objectives              
              of the trip is to develop joint US/PRC investigations of the                   
              Xianshuihe under the Protocol.  This research is a component of                
              the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
