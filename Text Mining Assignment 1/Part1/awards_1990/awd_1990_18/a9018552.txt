Abstract    :
                This research is to analyze and interpret the high-quality,                  
              multicomponent, normal-incidence to wide-angle data that were                  
              collected by the University of Arizona PACE Piggyback                          
              Lithospheric Experiment.  Focus of the work will be: 1) to place               
              constraints on Poisson's ratio and lower crustal composition; 2)               
              analyze upper crustal P-wave and S-wave anisotropy; 3)  model                  
              normal-incidence to wide-angle reflections to determine P-wave                 
              and S-wave velocity structure; 4) reconcile refraction and COCORP              
              reflection results that offer widely differing interpretations of              
              crustal thickness and reflectivity; 5) place quantitative                      
              constraints on the dip of the Moho beneath the transition zone                 
              and constrain the nature of this fundamental boundary; and 6) to               
              interpret upper crustal structures that control Colorado Plateau               
              monoclines.
