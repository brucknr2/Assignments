Abstract    :
              Geological, geochemical, and isotopic studies indicate that                    
              Archean komatiites at Kambalda, Western Australia, thermally                   
              eroded and assimilated crustal rocks during ascent.  Similar                   
              komatiites occur in the Chukotat Group of the early Proterozoic                
              Cape Smith belt in northern Quebec which are superbly exposed and              
              only slightly metamorphosed.  This project is to establish                     
              stratigraphic and petrogenetic relationships between the                       
              mineralized komatiitic peridotites and associated gabbros and                  
              basalts of the Chukotat Group, and determine the influence of                  
              thermal erosion and hybridization on the genesis of associated                 
              nickel sulfide mineralization.  The project will involve detailed              
              field mapping, relogging of selected diamond drill cores, whole-               
              rock geochemical and Nd isotopic analysis, and S isotopic                      
              analysis of sulfide ores and sulfide sediments.
