Abstract    :
                   This project will provide new geochronological data on several            
              terrane components in the northern Philippines using U-Pb isotopic             
              studies.  Each terrane is bounded by major fault zones and contains            
              a distinct assemblage of rock type and structures.  The                        
              geochronology will provide an "absolute time" framework upon which             
              kinematic, paleomagnetic and stratigraphic data can be interpreted.            
              Areas selected for detailed study include the Angat and Zambales               
              ophiolites and selected plutons from the Central Cordillera and S.             
              Sierra Madres of Luzon Island.  The results will provide much                  
              needed reliable time markers for other workers in the region, and              
              will help formulate better models for the tectonic evolution of the            
              northern Philippines.
