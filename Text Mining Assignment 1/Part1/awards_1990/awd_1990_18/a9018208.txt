Abstract    :
              This proposal is for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric                      
              Administration (NOAA) to continue, through 1995, the operation of              
              an atmospheric monitoring observatory at Amundsen-Scott South                  
              Pole Station, under the direction of the Climate Monitoring and                
              Diagnostics Laboratory, Boulder, Colorado.  Program objectives                 
              are the determination of concentrations, time variations, and                  
              other properties of atmospheric trace gases and aerosols that may              
              have potential impacts on the global climate.  Solar and infrared              
              radiation fluxes are also monitored to determine long-term means               
              and any possible trends that could be associated with climate                  
              changes.
