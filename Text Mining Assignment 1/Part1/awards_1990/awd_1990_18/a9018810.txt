Abstract    :
              This grant funded a workshop wherein 40 participants evaluated the             
              state and needs of U.S. microelectronics systems education, and                
              then prepared recommendations and plans for this decade.  The                  
              emphasis was on experimental systems building.  The principal                  
              topics considered in microelectronics systems education were                   
              curriculum, design frames, computer-aided design, equipment, and               
              infrastructure.  Copies of the report were distributed to                      
              university department chairs, workshop attendees, plus interested              
              leaders in industry and government.
