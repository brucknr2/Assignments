Abstract    :
                   Recent studies have suggested that the Triassic to middle                 
              Jurassic arc of the southwest Cordilleran United States occupied               
              an extensional graben from the Klamaths to the Sonoran Desert.                 
              Preliminary work indicates that the arc may also have been the site            
              for large-scale sinestral rifting in the Mojave Desert to Sonoran              
              Desert portion, with continued transpression in the northern                   
              portion.  This project will conduct detailed sedimentologic and                
              geochronlogical studies aimed at testing these working hypothesis.             
              Results may demonstrated the importance and timing of both                     
              transtension and transpression along the Menozoic arc of the                   
              southwestern United States.
