Abstract    :
                   Colony integration is the term used to define the degres of               
              functional interdependence between ramets (e.g., zooids, polyps)               
              within a colony.  Work in many different systems has revealed                  
              repeated patterns of colony integration within and between taxa                
              and found repeated correlations between patterns of integration                
              and patterns of clonal organism life history traits.  Despite the              
              success of this correlative approach, virtually all work on                    
              colony integration has been based on morphological inference,                  
              with little attempt to directly observe, measure, or                           
              experimentally perturb the vascular systems of colonial                        
              invertebrates.  This work will initiate a research program                     
              designed to place studies of colony integration on a firm                      
              functional foundation based on detailed analysis of the anatomy                
              and behavior of the vascular system of a clonal invertebrate.
