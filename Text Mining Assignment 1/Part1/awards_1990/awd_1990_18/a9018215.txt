Abstract    :
                This research is to perform a series of forward modelling                    
              experiments to study the effect of rough and anisotropic upper                 
              mantle structure on long-period seismic waveforms, and data                    
              experiments to infer the size and extent of such structure.  This              
              includes the synthesis of seismic anisotropy models derived from               
              simple convective flows using the theory for lattice-preferred                 
              orientation.  This will be combined with finite amplitude thermal              
              convection models and free oscillation calculations to generate                
              synthetic seismograms for anisotropic aspherical models derived                
              from physical first principles.  Objectives of the study include               
              an understanding of the tradeoff between rough lateral structure               
              and anelasticity in long-period surface-wave data, the tradeoff                
              between isotropic and anisotropic mantle structure, and the bias               
              introduced into smooth tomographic inversions by rough and/or                  
              anisotropic velocity structure.
