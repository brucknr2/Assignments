Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Animal communities at the recently discovered deep Sea                         
              hydrothermal vents (depth >2000 m) exhibit biomass densities                   
              which are probably as high as any ecosystem on earth.  As a                    
              matter reaches the sea floor at such depths (Suess, 1980).                     
              Instead, local production of organic carbon by chemoautotrophic                
              bacteria is believed to form much or all of the nutritional                    
              base at these vents.  At the vents some of these bacteria are                  
              free-living either suspended in hydrothermal plumes or attached                
              to surfaces (Jannasch and Mottl, 1985; Jannasch, 1989).  These                 
              offer food sources for filter feeding and surface grazing vent                 
              animals.  In this permanently dark environment, however, the                   
              major portion of life-supporting interactions between bacteria                 
              and animals occurs in endosymbiotic associations (reviewed by                  
              Childress et al., 1987).  In most examples studied to date the                 
              symbiont is some type of chemoautotrophic sulfur bacterium, but                
              methane oxidizing symbionts are also known (Cavanaugh et al.,                  
              1987; Childress et al., 1986).  Chemoautotrophic sulfur                        
              bacteria generate energy (ATP or a proton motive force) by the                 
              oxidation of reduced sulfur compounds (sulfide, elemental                      
              sulfur, thiosulfate, etc.) and usually fix CO2 via the Calvin-                 
              Benson cycle also employed by green plants and algae,  There                   
              are two general ways a symbiont might provide nutrients to its                 
              host.  The symbiont might remain intact but overproduce certain                
              organics which leak out of the symbiont or be deposited                        
              extracellularly.  Alternatively, the host might degrade a                      
              fraction of the bacteria using lytic enzymes, possibly                         
              localized in vacuoles.  There is little evidence pointing to                   
              the operation of either mechanism.
