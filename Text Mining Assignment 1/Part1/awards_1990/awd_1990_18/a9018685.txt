Abstract    :
              The functional and structural properties of Rp1 will be analyzed at            
              the molecular level and by complementation studies.  Individual                
              clones from the Rp1 region will be fine-structure mapped relative              
              to Rp1 functional components and screened for the location of                  
              encoded transcripts.  cDNA clones derived from potential Rp1                   
              transcripts will be isolated and mapped relative to the genomic                
              clones.  Chromosome walking will be used to acquire genomic clones             
              that are likely to fully encode Rp1-derived disease resistance.                
              These clones will be transformed into maize and tested for the                 
              ability to impart race-specific resistance to transformed                      
              tissues.***//
