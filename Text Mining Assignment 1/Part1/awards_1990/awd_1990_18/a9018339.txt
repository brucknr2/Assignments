Abstract    :
                   This award provides 50% funding for the acquisition of a                  
              specialized temperature control system to be incorporated in the               
              high-temperature-pressure laboratory in the Department of Geology              
              and Geophysics at the University of Wisconsin. The system will                 
              automatically control the temperature of 20 pressure vessels during            
              long-term experiments.                                                         
                   The laboratory is devoted primarily to the investigation of               
              the aqueous solubility of minerals under temperature and pressure              
              conditions comparable to those existing in the Earth's crust.
