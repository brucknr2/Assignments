Abstract    :
              This research is an attempt to couple the mechanics of particulate             
              media with the continuum theory of mixtures in order to better                 
              quantify the behavior of fine grained soils in terms of the soil               
              fabric.  This will be accomplished through the use of the theory               
              of mixtures in a Cosserat continuum.  The resulting coupled theory             
              will have the capability of handling problems involving initial and            
              evolving fabric and stress anisotropy, rotation of principal                   
              stresses, and partial drainage.//
