Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The aim of this research program is to understand the mechanism                
              for electron transfer reactions in biological systems.  The                    
              work is focussed on electron tunneling pathways in proteins,                   
              i.e., how the protein environment mediates the electron                        
              transfer reaction.  The work is divided into three categories:                 
                                                                                             
              1)  Tunneling Pathways in Proteins - Searches for tunneling                    
              pathways in native and modified will be performed.  Dr. Onuchic                
              will try to understand how details of the protein structure                    
              define a tunneling pathway.  New theoretical techniques will                   
              be developed to understand inference effects in individual                     
              pathways as well as between the pathways.                                      
                                                                                             
              2)  Dynamical Modulation of the Tunneling Maxtrix Element - A                  
              tunneling pathway is composed of covalent bonds, through space                 
              contacts, and hydrogen bonds.  These though space contacts may                 
              be flexible, and their motion may modulate the tunneling matrix                
              element.  Dr. Onuchic proposed to investigate how this motion                  
              introduces a temperature dependence to the tunneling matrix                    
              element.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              3)  Model Improvement and New Theoretical Aspects - New                        
              theoretical calculations will be performed to improve the                      
              parameters used in the model and to understand the importance                  
              of multi-electron effects on tunneling pathways.
