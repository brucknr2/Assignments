Abstract    :
              The fellowship research and training will be carried out by Dr.                
              Ann Bucklin in the laboratory of Mitchell Sogin, Director of                   
              the Molecular Evolution Program at the Marine Biological                       
              Laboratory, Woods Hole.  Molecular techniques will be used to                  
              sequence the mitochondrial ribosomal RNA genes of several                      
              oceanic planktonic copepods.  Sequencing will be done by                       
              polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the genes,                    
              using conserved and newly-designed primers, and a modification                 
              of the Sanger dideoxynucleotide sequencing method.  Sequences                  
              of both small (12S) and large (16S) subunit rRNA genes and                     
              their flanking regions will be obtained.  Intra- and                           
              interspecific variability in these sequences will be quantified                
              in order to evaluate their use as indicators of population                     
              genetic and evolutionary phenomena.  It is anticipated that                    
              mitochondrial rRNA genes will prove to be useful indicators of                 
              population genetic structure and gene flow patterns in oceanic                 
              copepods.  Conserved regions of the rRNA genes may be useful to                
              examine phylogenetic relationships within copepod or other                     
              crustacean families, and will provide interesting comparisons                  
              with similar studies using genomic indicators.
