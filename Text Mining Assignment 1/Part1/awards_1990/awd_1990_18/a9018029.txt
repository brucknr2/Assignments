Abstract    :
              The objective of this research is to explore new ideas, advanced               
              technoligies, and new materials utilized by Japanese construction              
              companies and research centers in order to establish an innovative             
              and creative engineering solution to the existing construction and             
              design problems of concrete core slipforming with a cross-                     
              disciplinary approach.
