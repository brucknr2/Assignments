Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project investigates the regulation of vertebrate renal                   
              function, focusing on the reptiles.  Although paradigms have been              
              accepted for the regulation of the kidney in nonmammalian                      
              vertebrates, relatively little quantitative data is available for              
              any group.  This study proposes to investigate the determinants of             
              release for hormones likely to influence renal function.  And to               
              provide important information on the hormonal regulation of the                
              reptilian kidney at the whole organ level and at the level of the              
              single functional unit within the kidney, the nephron.  These                  
              approaches will utilize intact animal studies, isolated organ                  
              perfusion, and intravital microscopy.  Although mammals and                    
              nonmammalian vertebrates share virtually all the hormonal and                  
              neural components for the control of excretion by the kidney, the              
              relationships between plasma hormones, neural activity, and renal              
              function appear to be significantly different.  This variation in              
              the response of the kidney and in regulatory dominance among                   
              vertebrates may allow specific regulatory mechanisms to be more                
              easily observed and elucidated in nonmammalian kidneys.  Therefore,            
              this project will markedly broaden our understanding of the                    
              regulation of reptilian kidney function, and at the same time, may             
              provide a useful model for investigating principles and mechanisms             
              of renal regulation by hormonal and neural control shared by all               
              vertebrates.//
