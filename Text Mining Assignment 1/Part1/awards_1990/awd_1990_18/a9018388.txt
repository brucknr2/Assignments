Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Processes driving the baroclinic circulation in the Gulf of                    
              Maine will be investigated by using a three-dimensional                        
              numerical model.  Extensions in the use of Finite Element                      
              Methods to complicated coastal regions will result as well as                  
              better understanding of circulation within the Gulf of Maine.
