Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The Reunion hot spot has been active over at least the past               
              70 M.y. and has left its mark on the Indian and African                        
              tectonic plates of the Indian Ocean. On the African plate, the                 
              Mascarene ridge is coincident with a significant positive geoid                
              anomaly, similar to the Hawaiian swell, indicating that the                    
              apparent compensation of the topographic load is deep in the                   
              lithosphere or asthenosphere. Utilizing a French research                      
              vessel based in the Indian Ocean, the PI will make appropriate                 
              heat flow measurements to determine the extent to which the                    
              deep compensation may be explained by a static thermal anomaly,                
              or whether it is primarily dynamic support as a result of                      
              active mantle convection, as the Hawaiian hot spot now appears.                
              The heat flow and other geophysical fields will be modeled with                
              numerical methods.
