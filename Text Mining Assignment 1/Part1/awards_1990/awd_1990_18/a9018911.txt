Abstract    :
                   This project will measure the uniaxial compressive stress-                
              strain relationship of a suite of cemented tungsten-carbide                    
              samples. Because of its high strength, cemented tungsten carbide               
              is used as a key structural component in the design of state-of-               
              the-art high pressure multi-anvil apparatus capable of                         
              experimentation up to 25-30 GPa. Optimal design of high-pressure               
              apparatus is hampered by a lack of information about the                       
              fundamental rheology of this material under conditions that mimic              
              the conditions imposed on the material in such high-pressure                   
              systems. This project is intended to provide the necessary data,               
              and the results will also enable finite element analysis of new                
              designs for improved high-pressure apparatus. Experimental                     
              capabilities in the ultra-high range of static pressure are                    
              necessary for basic research in earth sciences and materials                   
              science.
