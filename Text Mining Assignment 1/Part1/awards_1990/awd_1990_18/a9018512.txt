Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Under the direction of Dr. Douglas Price, Mr. Joseph Ezzo will                 
              conduct doctoral dissertation research.  He will carry out                     
              chemical analysis on the approximately 270 human skeletons from                
              the archaeological site of Grasshopper Pueblo, located in                      
              Arizona.  He will reconstruct changes in the inhabitant's diet                 
              over time.  To do this he will determine concentrations of trace               
              elements such as strontium and calcium which reflect the relative              
              amount of meat consumed.  Analysis of carbon isotopic ratios will              
              provide insight into the importance of plants such as maize in                 
              the diet.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              The Grasshopper site is important for several reasons.  First                  
              occupied ca. A.D. 1295, it grew into a major prehistoric                       
              settlement but was suddenly abandoned about A.D. 1400.  This same              
              trend in mirrored in other sites in the region, and it is unclear              
              to archaeologists what underlying process is responsible.  Mr.                 
              Ezzo postulates that examining change in diet may shed light on                
              this issue, because non-chemical analyses of human skeletal                    
              material suggest that subsistence related stresses may have grown              
              severe as population density increased.  Chemical analysis                     
              provides a new and complimentary approach to this question.                    
              Because Grasshopper is one of the best-known sites in North                    
              America - research has been conducted there for 27 consecutive                 
              field seasons - the comparative data base is excellent.                        
                                                                                             
              Several benefits will result from this research.  New light will               
              be shed on a major prehistoric site, and our understanding of the              
              mechanisms which govern the growth and decline of technologically              
              simple populations will be increased.  The project will also                   
              provide a test of the utility of such chemical based approaches                
              and, finally, will assist in the training of a promising young                 
              scientist.
