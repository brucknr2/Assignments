Abstract    :
              Enhancers can be located thousands of base pairs from a gene                   
              promoter and still stimulate transcription.  Although there is no              
              definitive data on how enhancers act over such long distances,                 
              enhancers are widely believed to serve as the binding sites for                
              transcription factors which migrate to gene promoters via a looping            
              out of the intervening DNA.  In contrast to this conventional view,            
              we have obtained evidence suggesting that the c-fos and polyoma                
              enhancers act by inducing a greater accessibility of the DNA                   
              template as detected by increased DNase I sensitivity.  A major                
              goal of this proposal is to test the model that enhancers act at               
              a distance by increasing the genetic accessibility of chromatin.               
              To address this objective, enhancers or enhancer deletions will be             
              inserted into the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT)               
              gene of male human diploid cells by site-directed homologous                   
              recombination (gene targeting).  Nuclei from recombinant or wild               
              type cells resulting from the DNA inserts.  Relative rates of DNase            
              I sensitivity will be determined by a novel PCR assay that reliably            
              measures DNA accessibility at any genetic loci in chromatin.                   
                                                                                             
              These experiments will determine definitively whether enhancers can            
              elevate DNase I sensitivity at a locus characterized by low native             
              DNase I sensitivity.***//
