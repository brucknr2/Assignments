Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is the first experimental study of the effect of magnesium                
              content and precipitation rate on the  13C of magnesian calcite.               
              Magnesian calcite (Mg-calcite), calcite with roughtly greater                  
              than 10 mole percent MgCO3, is an important and often dominant                 
              component of shallow marine sediments, and serves as a Mg and CO3              
              source for subsequent dolomitization.  Surprisingly, the 13C                   
              fractionation between Mg-calcite and HCO3 has never been                       
              determined.  Experimental procedures have been developed for the               
              precipitation of calcite and aragonite at constant rates in                    
              solutions of constant temperature and chemical and isotopic                    
              composition.  Eighty-five previous experiments yield calcite-                  
              HCO3 and aragonite-HCO3 13C enrichment factors averaging 1.0 and               
              2.5% respectively.  Calcite-HCO3 enrichment factors ( cl-HCO3-)                
              do not vary significantly with temperature (10o to 40oC) or                    
              precipitation rate (103.0 to 105.2 umol m2hr1).  Aragonite-HCO3                
              enrichment factors ( ar-HCO3) show a weak correlation with                     
              temperature, suggesting that  ar-HCO3 decreases 0.020%oC-1.  Only              
              in experiments at 10o and 25oC does  ar-HCO3 exhibits a weak                   
              inverse correlation with precipitation rate.  The project                      
              includes roughly 30 experiments at 25oC over a range of                        
              precipitation rates between 2 and 5 umol m2 hr1 for solutions                  
              having Mg/Ca ratios of 5 to 20, producing Mg-calcites with 7 to                
              20 mole % MgCO3.  Determination of these Mg-calcite-HCO3 13C                   
              fractionation relations will permit researchers to better                      
              quantify the original isotopic composition of marine sediments                 
              and waters, vital information for studies of global change and                 
              carbonate diagenesis.
