Abstract    :
              This project will make cosmological measurements of two distinctly             
              different types.                                                               
                                                                                             
              1.   The experimenters will make cosmic microwave background                   
              radiation (CMBR) measurements of the absolute brightness of the sky            
              above South Pole at three frequencies, 1.0, 1.5 and 7.5 GHz.                   
              Similar measurements were made at the higher two frequencies from              
              Pole in 1989, but the 1.0 GHz radiometer is new.  The purpose is               
              to determine if there are deviations from the CMBR temperature of              
              2.735 K which has been measured at higher frequencies, most notably            
              by the new NASA satellite Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE).                   
              Deviations, at different wavelengths, from the 2.736 K figure would            
              indicate that there has been an input of significant energy into               
              the universe since the time of the big bang.                                   
                                                                                             
              2.   They will attempt to measure microwave radiation coming                   
              upwards from the polar ice sheet, which is over two kilometers                 
              thick at South Pole.  It has been hypothesized that extremely                  
              energetic neutrinos that have passed entirely through the Earth can            
              interact in the ice, or rocks just below, and cause a                          
              electromagnetic shower that could result in detectable radio                   
              emissions.  If this is true, then the polar ice sheet could be used            
              as a vast detector for the new field of neutrino astronomy.                    
                                                                                             
              This project is jointly funded by the Divisions of Polar Programs              
              and Astronomy.
