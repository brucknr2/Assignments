Abstract    :
                This research follows advances developed under a prior NSF                   
              grant where new techniques were formulated for the detection and               
              characterization of earthquakes with anomalously long duration.                
              A new 10-year catalog of normal-mode excitation events has been                
              made that allows the systematic identification of slow                         
              earthquakes on a global scale.  This has led to the discovery of               
              a new type of earthquake which excites free oscillations but does              
              not generate wave groups observable on long-period or short-                   
              period seismograms, called "quiet earthquakes."  These unusually               
              slow events may be precursory to fast ruptures, or normal                      
              earthquakes.  This research will more precisely define the slow                
              ruptures and investigate whether they are precursory to large                  
              damaging events and thus provide a means of short-term earthquake              
              prediction.  This research is a component of the National                      
              Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
