Abstract    :
              The Black Mountains, Death Valley, CA, present an opportunity to               
              characterize a magmatic system developed during large-scale                    
              intracontinental extension.  The goals of this project are to:                 
              1) determine the relationship of magma sources and magma                       
              evolution to the geometry and stages of extension, 2) determine                
              the chemical and isotopic signature of new additions to the crust              
              in extensional provinces, 3) determine the crust-mantle mass                   
              balance for the southern Basin and Range Province, 4) determine                
              whether or not the geochemistry of the intrusive series is                     
              reflected in the eruptive sequence.  The PI hopes to: 1)                       
              determine the ages of various plutonic bodies through U-Pb, Rb-Sr              
              and fission track studies, 2) measure the Nd, Sr, and Pb isotope,              
              and trace element composition, and 3) apply geobarometry studies.              
              All this wil be done following careful field work.
