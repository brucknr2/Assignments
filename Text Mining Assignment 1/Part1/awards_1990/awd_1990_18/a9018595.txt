Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will study the partitioning of                      
              important radiogenic and trace elements between mineral and melt               
              under mantle conditions.  Using the laser heated diamond cell,                 
              experiments will be conducted at pressures up to 100 GPa and                   
              temperatures up to 5000 K.  The proposed experiments will be the               
              first done under the appropriate high pressure and temperature                 
              conditions to provide constraints on lower mantle geochemistry.
