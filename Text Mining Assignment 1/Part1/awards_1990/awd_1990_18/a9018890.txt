Abstract    :
                   This project is concerned with developing basic data on                   
              atomic and molecular nitrogen that is needed to better understand              
              energy flow and chemistry in the upper atmosphere. Electron                    
              impact dissociation and photodissociation of molecular nitrogen                
              produce atomic nitrogen in either the ground state N(4S) or in                 
              one of its excited states, N(2D) or N(2P). The reactivity of                   
              atomic nitrogen and its role in the odd nitrogen cycle depends                 
              sensitively upon the state of excitation of the nitrogen atom.                 
              Changes by 100% in thermospheric NO concentrations are predicted               
              when the ratio of ground to excited states produced in                         
              dissociation  is varied from 50:50 to 46:54.  While a ratio of                 
              50:50 is assumed on theoretical grounds, the ratio itself has                  
              never been determined experimentally.  The principle investigator              
              has developed a novel technique that permits direct measurement                
              of the excitation state of both nitrogen atoms produced in N2                  
              dissociation.  The measurement is carried out in a fast beam of                
              nitrogen molecules using laser excitation to study  excited                    
              states of N2 in the region from 10 to 18 eV.  This technique will              
              be used to determine precisely the rate of predissociation of                  
              excited states of N2 and the state of excitation of the atomic                 
              nitrogen products formed.  Branching ratios to N(4S), N(2D), and               
              N(2P) are then obtained by summation over all the states involved              
              in photodissociation and electron impact dissociation of N2.
