Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Drosophila melanogaster accessory  gland is a male specific                
              tissue whose cells synthesize and secrete a variety of products                
              which are transferred to females during copulation.  These                     
              transferred products are involved in several processes in the                  
              female. These include increased egg production and oviposition,                
              storage of viable sperm, and lowered receptivity to further                    
              mating. Dr. Kraus has obtained a cloned gene which is expressed                
              only in the accessory gland. The RNA encoded by this gene is                   
              approximately 400bp in length, making the determination of gene                
              structure and sequence a relatively simple task. The goal of the               
              proposed research is two fold; 1) to define the DNA sequences                  
              responsible for the regulation of this gene, and 2) to begin to                
              identify the function of this gene's polypeptide product. Dr.                  
              Kraus will first sequence the gene, and then define the sequences              
              responsible for the sex and tissue specific expression via                     
              deletion mutagenesis and germline transformation. A polyclonal                 
              antibody against the polypeptide will be raised in rabbits. Dr.                
              Kraus will then study this gene's expression during the processes              
              of aging and mating by a combination of Western and Northern                   
              analyses. Finally, he will begin to examine the role of the                    
              polypeptide in the reproductive process by determining whether or              
              not it is transferred to females.
