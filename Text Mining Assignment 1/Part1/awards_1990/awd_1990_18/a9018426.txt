Abstract    :
                   An active debate is centered on a substantial disagreement                
              concerning the importance of volume change in cleaved rock.  The               
              research integrates new methods of geochemical mapping with strain             
              maps to determine the non-volatile element and volume changes in               
              space cleavage in rocks.  Major element compositional data will be             
              acquired by an XRF macroprobe designed specifically for the                    
              purpose.  The machine bridges the gap in analytical resolution                 
              between electron beam and whole rock XRF methods.  Major element               
              data will be converted into volume loss information by identifying             
              insoluble elements and calculating volume equivalents.  Strain maps            
              will be constructed using established techniques such as pressure              
              shadow incremental strains and center-to-center methods.  Detailed             
              samples from the Delaware Water Gap area of PA and NJ will be used             
              to examine the variability of volume change within and between                 
              cleaved units of shale, carbonate and quartzite.  The results will             
              resolve important outstanding controversies concerning cleavage                
              development in rocks.
