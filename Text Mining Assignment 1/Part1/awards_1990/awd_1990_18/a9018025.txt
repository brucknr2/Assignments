Abstract    :
              The focus of this project is the reactivity of vanadium                        
              bromoperoxidase isolated from marine organisms (e.g.,                          
              Ascophyllum nodosum, Fucus distichus Macrocystis pyrifera).                    
              The marine environment is a very rich source of halogenated                    
              and selectively oxidized metabolites, many of which have                       
              important biological activities (e.g., chemical defense,,                      
              antimicrobial), and applications as pharmaceuticals                            
              (antineoplastic, antiinflammatory, antifungal, antibacterial)                  
              and specialty chemicals (e.g., dyes).  V-BrPO catalyzes the                    
              bromination of certain organic compounds and the oxidation of                  
              others.  The PI has shown that in the absence of a good                        
              substrate for bromination, V-BrPO catalyzes the formation of                   
              singlet oxygen.  V-BrPO is not inactivated by high                             
              concentrations of singlet oxygen or oxidized bromine species,                  
              contrary to the behavior of the FeHeme haloperoxidases.  The                   
              plan is to investigate the selectivity of bromination vs                       
              oxidation for important marine natural product precursors                      
              (e.g., indoles, furans, B-diketons and B-ketoacids), the                       
              kinetics and mechanism of bromination and oxidation.  The                      
              mechanism of chloroperoxidase activity of the vanadium enzyme                  
              which the PI has recently discovered , will also be                            
              investigated.  The non heme chloroperoxidase from the fungus                   
              Curvularia inaequalis will be studied, including                               
              determination of the active-site metal ion (e.g., likely to                    
              be iron, zinc or vanadium), the kinetics and mechanism of                      
              halogenation vs dioxygen formation, and the relative                           
              reactivity of oxidation vs halogenation.
