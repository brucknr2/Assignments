Abstract    :
                This research involves a collaborative effort of four                        
              universities to use the PASSCAL portable broad-band seismometer                
              array facility for a comprehensive imaging study of the lateral                
              transitions in mantle structure beneath the Rocky Mountain Front.              
                                                                                             
              The Front Range of the Colorado Rockies marks the eastern                      
              boundary of heavily tectonized western North America and the                   
              western physiographic boundary of the stable continental                       
              interior.  Earlier studies show that there is a major lateral                  
              transition in seismic velocities across the Front Range                        
              transition, but its details are poorly understood.  Understanding              
              this transition will provide constraints on models of western                  
              U.S. dynamics and evolutionary models of the North American                    
              craton.
