Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award provides support for a workshop to formulate a plan of              
              research to study terrane accretion in southeast Alaska and                    
              adjacent portions of British Columbia.  Geologists and                         
              geochemists who have extensive experience in the region will be                
              brought together with geophysicists who have expertise imaging                 
              features in the deep crust.  Because of the network of water ways              
              in southeast Alaska, it will be possible to exploit the logistic               
              and scientific advantages of using offshore/onshore seismic                    
              imaging techniques.  The geological community has a good working               
              understanding of the distribution of rock types in the area and                
              models for their formation and evolution.  What is now needed are              
              constraints on the nature and distribution of structures and                   
              lithologies to the base of the crust and into the upper mantle.                
              At the workshop, the overall tectonic history of the region will               
              be presented, followed by discussions leading to a determination               
              of what geophysical techniques could be used to resolve the                    
              major questions and where they could best be applied.
