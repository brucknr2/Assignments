Abstract    :
              This research is concerned with the atomic and electronic                      
              properties of tetrahedrally coordinated compound semiconductor                 
              surfaces and their interfaces with metals.  The technologically                
              important (100) surfaces grown by molecular beam epitaxy will be               
              studied in addition to II-VI wurtzite surfaces.  The work will                 
              focus on an in depth investigation of photoemission induced                    
              surface photovoltage and its implications on the validity of the               
              present Schottky barrier models in addition to the structural                  
              characteristics of (100) interfaces.  The study of gallium                     
              antimonide surfaces and their interfaces with a wide range of                  
              metals.  Following the successful determination of the atomic                  
              structure of (1120) and (1010) wurtzite cadmium selenide and                   
              sulfide studies will be initiated of their interfaces with                     
              totally reactive species such as antimony and bismuth.  The                    
              objective is to identify atomically ordered and abrupt model                   
              interfaces which can be employed in experimental and theoretical               
              studies of the role of the overlayer electronic structure,                     
              interface bonding, dangling bonds and local defects in the                     
              formation of Schottky barriers on these compounds.
