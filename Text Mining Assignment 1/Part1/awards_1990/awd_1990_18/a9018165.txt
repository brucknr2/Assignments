Abstract    :
                   One goal of research in aeronomy is to be able to determine               
              the properties of various regions of the upper atmosphere from                 
              ground-based measurements of airglow emission lines. The                       
              principal investigators involved in this work have made                        
              significant progress towards this goal through their past work in              
              determining thermospheric composition, temperature, and incident               
              EUV flux from ground-based measurements of twilight airglow                    
              lines; however much remains to be done to solve the complex                    
              theoretical modelling and data acquisition problems involved. The              
              proposed work is a carefully planned continuation of research                  
              aimed at advancing towards the goal. Development of models                     
              relating to attainable ground based airglow measurements will                  
              continue, with corroborative support from satellite                            
              measurements. The models developed will be upgraded and made user              
              friendly for use by the CEDAR spectroscopy community. The models               
              will further be modified and improved to incorporate incoherent                
              radar or ionosonde measurements, and to extend their range to a                
              global scope.  ***
