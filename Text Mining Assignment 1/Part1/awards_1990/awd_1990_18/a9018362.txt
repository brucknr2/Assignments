Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The overall objective of this project is to develop a model                    
              system for the study of the mechanism by which egg associated                  
              factors modulate sperm cell function and, potentially, regulate                
              fertilization. Speract, a peptide isolated from the jelly coat                 
              which surrounds the egg of the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus                   
              purpuratus, binds to specific receptors on the plasma membrane of              
              homologous sperm cells and initiates changes in sperm cell                     
              behavior and metabolism.  Previously, Dr. Dangott identified and               
              purified a 77,000 Mr glycoprotein as the speract receptor. A full              
              length cDNA clone has been isolated which codes for the receptor               
              protein. Using antibodies, nucleic acid probes and recombinant                 
              speract receptor proteins now available in his laboratory and                  
              others to be prepared, he proposes 1) to express recombinant                   
              speract receptors in heterologous cells in order to test and                   
              analyze the protein's function as a peptide receptor and signal                
              transducer, 2) recombinant chimeric receptor proteins will be                  
              engineered and expressed by standard molecular biological                      
              techniques in order to characterize the structural basis for the               
              receptor's peptide binding specificity and interaction with                    
              putative components of the signalling system, 3) prepare                       
              polyclonal antibodies to the speract receptor in rabbits that                  
              will be used to purify the receptor from sperm plasma membranes,               
              and 4) proteins associated with the receptor will be identified,               
              purified and primary amino acid sequence determined. The proteins              
              will be characterized for any biochemical activities and                       
              evaluated for any role in possible signal transduction pathways.
