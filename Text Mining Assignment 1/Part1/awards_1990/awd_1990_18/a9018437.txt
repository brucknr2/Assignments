Abstract    :
              Through preliminary studies, loci of magmatic transitions (e.g.,               
              from high Ba/Nb Steens-like lavas to low Ba/Nb alkalic basalts)                
              have been identified in north central Nevada (near Winnemucca,                 
              East of Fallon, and between Kane Springs Wash and the Lunar                    
              Crater volcanic field).  However, compositions of these magmas                 
              could also be influenced by lateral variations in basement                     
              (including lithospheric mantle) age and composition.  This                     
              project will carry out a detailed geochemical study of mafic                   
              lavas from roughly north-south and east-west transects across                  
              north-central Nevada to evaluate source characteristics.  Age                  
              determinations will be made for selected samples to establish the              
              chronology of magma source transitions.  These data will provide               
              important constraints on mantle involvement during the Cenozoic                
              regional extension of the Cordilleran region.
