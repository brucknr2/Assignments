Abstract    :
                   This award provides 50% funding for the acquisition of a mass             
              spectrometer system for the measurement of noble gases. The                    
              equipment will be installed at the Lamont-Doherty Geological                   
              Observatory of Columbia University. Columbia University is                     
              committed to providing the remaining funds needed.                             
                   The system will be capable of measuring all noble gases from              
              helium-3 to xenon-136 with high resolution and sensitivity.                    
              Applications will include projects emphasizing the use of noble                
              gas tracers in the field of hydrogeology, including reconstructions            
              of paleotemperatures for the continents, the dynamics of deep                  
              circulation groundwater using helium-4 and argon-40 and the dating             
              of groundwater using the tritium/helium-3 method
