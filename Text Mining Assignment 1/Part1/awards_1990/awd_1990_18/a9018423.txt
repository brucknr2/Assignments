Abstract    :
              The principal investigators will test the feasibility of                       
              conducting routine stable isotopic analyses of minerals and fluid              
              inclusions using a multichannel laser Raman microprobe.                        
              Successful development of the technique will enable analysis of                
              much smaller sample sizes than current techniques allow, and will              
              provide a means for testing isotopic homogeneity at a few per mil              
              level for spatial resolution of a few micrometers.  The technique              
              could greatly benefit both geological research, as well as                     
              research in other areas.
