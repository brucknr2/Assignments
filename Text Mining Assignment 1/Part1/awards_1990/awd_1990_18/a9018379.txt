Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              An international conference on the Large Marine Ecosystem (LME)                
              Concept and its application to Regional Marine Resource                        
              Management will be convened in October, 1990.  Its is supported                
              jointly by NOAA, NSF, IOC AND ICSEM.  LMEs are large regions of                
              the world ocean which are highly productive and subject to the                 
              forces of pollution and fishing as well as natural physical and                
              biological pressures.  The conference will seek ways to better                 
              predict the consequences of these forces with the goal of being                
              able to manage their continued productivity effectively.
