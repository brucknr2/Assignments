Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Individual Antennapedia and Bithorax complex homeobox genes in                 
              Drosophila have the remarkable property  of speciying the                      
              identity of entire segments of the larva during development.                   
              Current evidence indicates that these genes encode transcription               
              factors.  Although a great deal is known about the structure and               
              regulation of the two homeobox genes complexes, the next tier of               
              genes, "downstream" genes, regulated by the homeotics have not                 
              been identified.                                                               
                   The PI's laboratory has characterized "enhancer trap"                     
              transposon insertions in Drosophila whose expression of LacZ is                
              now regulated by the homeotic gene Antennapedia (Antp) in                      
              imaginal discs.  These newly acquired instances of regulation by               
              Antp are presumably due to adjacent enhancer sequences.  The                   
              isolation and characterization of these sequences which are                    
              normally regulated by Antp will allow for the generation of                    
              detailed patterns of expression of genes normally expressed later              
              in the developemnt of the imaginal discs and which are under the               
              control of Antp.  These studies should aid in understanding how                
              the regulatory mechaninms for establishing patterns are connected              
              to cell differentiation as it occurs during morphogenesis.
