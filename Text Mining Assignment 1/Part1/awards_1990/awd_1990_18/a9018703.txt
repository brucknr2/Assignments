Abstract    :
              This award is for support of a borehole study to determine                     
              the mechanisms that control the movement of antarctic ice-                     
              streams and to provide an observational basis for                              
              quantitative modeling of ice stream motions.  The objective                    
              is an understanding of the ice stream flow mechanism,                          
              including soft-bed deformation vs. basal sliding as the                        
              predominant flow process; flow law of basal till, or sliding                   
              law; nature of the basal water conduit system under the ice                    
              streams; sources of basal water; and lithologic evolution of                   
              basal till by erosion and comminution processes.
