Abstract    :
                   This award provides 50% funding for the acquisition of a                  
              theodolite, electronic distance measurer and ancillary equipment               
              to be used in detailed and very accurate local mapping of faults               
              and other near-surface manifestations of active tectonic movement.             
              The field equipment is to be used by the neotectonics research                 
              group in the Department of Geological Sciences at the University               
              of Oregon. The University of Oregon is committed to providing the              
              remaining funds needed.                                                        
                   Reconstruction of fault movements and other crustal                       
              deformation over the recent geological past is an important                    
              component of research leading to earthquake prediction.
