Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal is directed at evaluating whether a victorin-binding             
              protein (VBP) isolated from oat is the receptor for this toxin and             
              is the molecular determinant of susceptibility to the disease                  
              Victoria bight.  Using purified VBP, antibody thereto, and a full              
              length cDNA already cloned, the functional role of VBP will be                 
              examined in biochemical aspects, the binding domains examined,                 
              sequence of VBP-cDNA determined, a determination of segregation of             
              the gene encoding VBP studied, and sequence heterogeneity in VBP               
              of resistant and susceptible phenotypes compared.                              
                                                                                             
              This work is directed at a critical issue in modern plant                      
              pathology, namely an understanding of the site and function of a               
              plant gene product which regulated the pathogenicity of a fungal               
              pathogen that causes the disease, Victoria bight, of oat.
