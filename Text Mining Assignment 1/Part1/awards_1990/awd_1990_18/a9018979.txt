Abstract    :
              Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases esterify amino acids to cognate tRNAS               
              during the course of protein synthesis and are thus essential to               
              the decoding of genetic information in all organisms.  The                     
              objectives of the work proposed here are to determine the role of              
              zinc in the aminoacylation and/or DNA binding activities of E.                 
              coli alanyl-tRNA synthetase (ARS) and to elucidate structural                  
              elements that coordinate with this metal.  The function of zinc                
              in ARS will be explored through a series of denaturation,                      
              kinetic, and DNA binding experiments, and the location  of the                 
              metal binding site will be determined through a zinc-blotting                  
              procedure and atomic absorption spectroscopy.  Furthermore, the                
              hypothesis that this enzyme contains a metal binding domain                    
              resembling a zinc finger will be tested by chemical modification               
              and site-directed mutagenesis.  Such a domain may be involved in               
              the autoregulation of ARS synthesis, which is thought to be                    
              mediated through ARS binding to the promoter region of its gene.               
              Alternatively, the metal may be involved in the protein-RNA                    
              interaction, as is the case in retroviral zinc finger proteins.                
              The demonstration of either case would be novel for this                       
              important class of enzymes.
