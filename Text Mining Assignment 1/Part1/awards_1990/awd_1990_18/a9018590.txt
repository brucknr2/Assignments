Abstract    :
              The primary goal of this project is to determine both the                      
              prevalence and magnitude of protactinium-uranium fractionation in              
              volcanic rocks, so that the igneous processes causing the                      
              fractionation can be identified and temporally constrained.  The               
              secondary goal is to produce, purify, and calibrate an isotope-                
              dilution spike for Nb, and to develop the analytic methods to                  
              make isotope dilution thermal ionization mass spectrometry (ID-                
              TIMS) measurements of Nb in geologic materials.  A third goal                  
              assumes that protactinium and niobium have chemical properties so              
              similar that Nb may be considered a stable analog of Pa.  This                 
              hypothesis will be tested by analyzing young volcanic rock                     
              samples for Nb as well as Pa, Th and U.
