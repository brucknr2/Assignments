Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This international travel grant provides for roundtrip, coach                  
              airfare from South Bend, Indiana, to Frankfurt, FRG, for the                   
              week of September 20-27, 1990.  The purpose of this grant is                   
              to assist Dr. Joan F. Brennecke so that she may present a                      
              research paper at the European Federation of Chemical                          
              Engineering (administered by DECHEMA).  This meeting is held                   
              in Erlangan, Federal Republic of Germany, on September 24-26,                  
              1990.  The paper is entitled "Fluorescence Spectroscopy of                     
              Supercritical Fluid Systems with Entrainers."  This paper                      
              summarizes a new technique to investigate solute/entrainer                     
              interactions using fluorescence spectroscopy, which gives                      
              information on the strength of interactions, local entrainers                  
              concentrations, and sobent effect on reaction rate.  Many                      
              practical applications of supercritical fluid (SCF) extraction                 
              require the use of entrainers (usually 1 to 5 percent of a                     
              component of volatility intermediate between that of a solute                  
              and a SCF) to increase solubilities and selectivities.
