Abstract    :
              This award is for support of research to study the portion                     
              of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet which feeds in to the Ross                     
              Ice Shelf.  Satellite image analysis, ground surveying, and                    
              radar soundings by both airborne and ground-based systems                      
              comprise the necessary elements of this research.  These                       
              activities are an essential part of the Siple Coast Project                    
              and the new SeaRISE initiative which have as goals: 1)                         
              Determination of the configuration and mass balance of the                     
              Siple Coast region of the West Antarctic ice sheet, 2)                         
              Determination of the physical controls of ice flow in this                     
              region, and 3) Prediction of the future behavior of this                       
              region using numerical models.  These models will be                           
              enhanced by: 1) Completion of the surveys in the catchment                     
              areas of all the ice streams, 2) Determination of surface                      
              velocities in ice streams D and E,  3) Measurements of the                     
              discharge flux of ice streams D and E, 4) Examination of ice                   
              stream flow in the area of a surface undulation using                          
              satellite imagery, 5) Quantify the relative motion between                     
              the surface and bed in the grounded region just upstream of                    
              the grounding line.
