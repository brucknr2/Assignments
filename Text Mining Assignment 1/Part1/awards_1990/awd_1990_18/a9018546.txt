Abstract    :
              The potential for utilizing biological systems as a source of                  
              biodegradable thermoplastics is becoming increasingly                          
              attractive in view of the environmental problems associated                    
              with the disposal of oil based polymers.  A. eutrophus H16                     
              and P. oleovorans are biological organisms that produce poly                   
              D-3 hydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) with interesting polymeric                        
              properties.  The genes for the polymerases from these                          
              organisms have been cloned and sequenced.  The present                         
              proposal seeks support to develop methods for high level                       
              expression of the polymerases.  Large amounts of protein                       
              should facilitate isolation of polymerases, characterization                   
              of their substrate specificities and study of detailed                         
              reaction mechanism.  A detailed understanding of biological                    
              polyester formation should allow generation of PHA analogs                     
              (polymers and copolymers) of defined composition, length and                   
              functionality.
