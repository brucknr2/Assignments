Abstract    :
                   Survival analysis is a highly active area of research with                
              applications spanning the physical, engineering, biological, and               
              social sciences.  Researchers in survival techniques, in addition              
              to statisticians and biostatisticians, include epidemiologists,                
              reliability engineers, demographers and economists, who call this              
              area duration analysis.                                                        
                   This grant will partially support an international workshop on            
              Survival Analysis and Related Topics, to be held in June, 1991 at              
              the Ohio State University.  Two distinct groups are doing research             
              in the area of Survival Analysis.  The reliability and life testing            
              group focuses on survival analysis for physical systems, primarily             
              from a parametric viewpoint.  The biostatistical group studies                 
              techniques for use in the biomedical sciences, and uses                        
              nonparametric or semiparametric methods.  The major goal of this               
              workshop is to provide a forum for an exchange of ideas between                
              these groups, using the Bayesian approach, in order to develop an              
              environment for research leading to a synthesis of various ideas.
