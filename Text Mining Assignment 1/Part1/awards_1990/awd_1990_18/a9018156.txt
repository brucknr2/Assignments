Abstract    :
              The principal investigator, in a collaborative effort with Frank               
              Spera (Univ. of California at Santa Barbara),  will model binary               
              solid-melt phase change problems in magmatic  systems.  The                    
              solid, mush, and totally molten regions will be solved for                     
              temperature, fraction solidified, velocity, pressure, and                      
              coexisting solid (if present) and melt at every location and                   
              time.  The model will be tested against existing experimental                  
              data for various systems.  Further, it will be used to address                 
              fundamental questions about igneous processes for both basaltic                
              and granitic systems.
