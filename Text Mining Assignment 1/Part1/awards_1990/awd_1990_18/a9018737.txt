Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal outline experiments designed to increase                         
              understanding if pollen development through a molecular analysis               
              of stamen-specific genes.  Twelve, non-homologous, stamen                      
              specific cDNAs were isolated from tomato.  Four of the twelve                  
              genes are expressed only in tapetal tissue.  The tapetal tissue                
              is thought to be essential for the production of functional                    
              pollen.  Characterization of the tapetal specific cDNAs will                   
              provide direct evidence to establish the role of these genes in                
              pollen development.  DNA sequence of the tapetal-specific cDNA,                
              127a, shows the encoded protein to be glycine rich with a                      
              secretory sequence.  These properties and the proposed function                
              of the tapetal tissue for supplying material to the pollen                     
              strongly suggests that this protein is localized in the pollen                 
              cell wall.                                                                     
              The data obtained from the proposed experiments will be used to                
              predict the function of these genes and begin to elucidate the                 
              processes of the stamen that are essential for pollen                          
              development.
