Abstract    :
              In this project, P.I.'s will apply modeling techniques, including              
              a new ocean general circulation model, to study the occurrence of              
              deep zonal jets observed below the thermocline in equatorial                   
              regions of the world ocean.  Two models will be used, one with                 
              very fine resolution to determine the nonlinear nature of the deep             
              jets, and another, coarser resolution model, using the wave-                   
              parameterization from the first model to investigate large scale               
              forcing.
