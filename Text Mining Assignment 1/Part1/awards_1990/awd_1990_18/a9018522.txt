Abstract    :
              The purpose of this continuing project is to develop a set                     
              of engineering principles that can be used to design                           
              marine farms for U.S. waters, taking into account both the                     
              biological requirements of the organisms being farmed, and                     
              site-specific climatological and oceanographic conditions.                     
              The information needed to select a farm site, design and                       
              install a farm, and print, cultivate and harvest a crop                        
              must, for now, be gleaned from Japanese and Chinese                            
              literature, or books that focus on the cultivation of a                        
              specific group of organisms.                                                   
                                                                                             
              During the grant period, we will develop a real-time, on-                      
              site measurement and analysis system to quantify farm                          
              performance and immediately make adjustments at sea.  This                     
              will greatly speed up the process of identifying new                           
              design principles.  It will be possible to measure farm                        
              performance and then change buoyancy, adjust elastic                           
              members, and control flow around and through containers by                     
              using velcro-attached fins, damping disks, screens and                         
              scoops.  We will use dye and underwater photography to                         
              visualize and record flow patterns.
