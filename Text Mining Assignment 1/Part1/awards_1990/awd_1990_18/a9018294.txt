Abstract    :
                   This award provides 50% of the funds required for the                     
              acquisition of an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS) system            
              that is to be installed on the electron microprobe in the                      
              Department of Geological Sciences at Southern Methodist University.            
              The University is committed to providing the remaining funds needed            
              for the acquisition.                                                           
                   The EDS system will allow rapid chemical mapping of element               
              distribution in geological samples and will also serve to provide              
              rapid preliminary semi-quantitative analyses. The enhanced micro-              
              analytical capabilities of the electron microprobe system at SMU               
              will be used by faculty and students in the geological sciences,               
              anthropology, electrical engineering and other fields where micron-            
              scale chemical analysis is required.
