Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will investigate the structure and dynamics of fish               
              assemblages in selected coral reef habitats of the eastern                     
              Caribbean.  It will permit explicit comparisons between patch                  
              reef and continuous reef habitats at one site, and among                       
              comparable continuous reef habitats at several sites.  Species                 
              composition and abundance will be determined, as well as                       
              temporal change in these, and (for some species) associated                    
              patterns of settlement and recruitment.  At selected sites,                    
              dynamics of assemblages will use a consistent methodology, which               
              has been used  previously in studies on reefs in Australia, to                 
              collect comparable data on Caribbean reefs over several spatial                
              scales up to regional (750km), and over annual and daily temporal              
              scales.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              Current understanding of assemblage structure and dynamics                     
              emphasizes the "open" nature of these systems, and dynamics                    
              driven by, among other factors, highly variable rates of                       
              recruitment.  However, supporting data for this model come                     
              largely from a single habitat type in a few Great Barrier Reef                 
              sites, and its generality cannot be assumed.  This project will                
              provide the information necessary for a close comparison, on                   
              several spatial and temporal scales, of assemblage structure and               
              in addition, it establishes the essential descriptive baseline                 
              for Caribbean assemblage structure and dynamics from which the PI              
              will be able to build testable process hypotheses in future work.
