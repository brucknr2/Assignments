Abstract    :
                   This is a proposal to create and develop a sequence of                    
              courses for upper-level undergraduates in the area of                          
              human-computer interfaces.  The courses will be based on readings              
              and discussions and on group projects in the structured                        
              instruction, and will require novel materials as well as subject               
              matter.  A major objective will be developing skills to help                   
              students become competent in the design of computer-human                      
              systems.  Funds will be used to develop a hardware - software                  
              design platform and to promote an environment for group project                
              design.  Teaching materials and laboratory manuals will be                     
              developed to aid in transporting this environment to other                     
              institutions.
