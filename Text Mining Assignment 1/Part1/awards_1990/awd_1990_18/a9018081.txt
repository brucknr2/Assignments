Abstract    :
              Evidence is accumulating to suggest that small inputs of magnetic              
              gas could be an important, unrecognized parameter that might be                
              used to classify and understand systems that are otherwise                     
              similar.  Coupled analyses of gas abundances and isotopic                      
              compositions will be made of fluid inclusions from several                     
              deposits that might have received inputs of magnetic gas,                      
              including Comstock, Nevada and Hishikari, Japan.  Analyses will                
              also be made of vapor-rich inclusions from porphyry copper and                 
              acid-sulfate deposits.  The study will be guided by results of                 
              gas and isotopic analyses of materials from active geothermal                  
              systems.  This should impact our understanding of both active and              
              fossil hydrothermal systems.
