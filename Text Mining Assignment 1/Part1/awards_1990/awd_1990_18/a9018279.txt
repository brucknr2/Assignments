Abstract    :
                   This award provides partial funding for the support of a                  
              research technician for a period of three year. The technician will            
              be working in the laser Raman microprobe facility in the Department            
              of Earth and Planetary Sciences at Washington University in St.                
              Louis.                                                                         
                   The technician will maintain the optical, electronic, and                 
              computer components of the Raman microprobe, and perform analyses              
              for research projects that include Raman microspectroscopy of                  
              graphite samples from the Earth's mantle and fluid inclusions                  
              trapped in mineral grains of rocks of deep-seated origin.
