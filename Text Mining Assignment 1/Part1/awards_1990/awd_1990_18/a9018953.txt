Abstract    :
                   This award is for completion of the completion of the                     
              complex apparatus for shear anelasticity measurements on olivine.              
              The PIs have developed an active water cooling system to remove                
              waste heat from the furnace, and will soon have the apparatus                  
              working at high temperatures.  The oxygen fugacity control                     
              developed using remotely conditioned argon gas is operational,                 
              and will be incorporated into the system.
