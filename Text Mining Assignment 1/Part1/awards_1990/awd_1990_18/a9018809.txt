Abstract    :
                   Group theory is applied to the analysis of atomic shells                  
              to 1) understand better the many surprising and unexpected                     
              simplifications that occur when group labels are used to                       
              describe atomic states and 2) exploit that knowledge in                        
              constructing effective operators to fit experimental data more                 
              closely.  This leads to a description involving quasiparticles                 
              which can be thought of as quarks.  The work is applicable to                  
              the spectra of the rare earths and actinide elements and has                   
              applications to many other areas of physics.
