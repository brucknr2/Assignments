Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The long-range goal of this research is to identify, clone, and                
              sequence genes encoding allorecognition determinants from the                  
              colonial hydroid, Hydractinia.  Work to date has shown the                     
              feasibility of producing isogenic colonies which differ in their               
              histocompatibility responses.  During this grant period, the                   
              applicants propose to: 1)  continue ongoing analysis of the                    
              transmission genetics of fusibility in this hydroid, 2) produce,               
              in bulk, tissues from isogenic colonies which differ in their                  
              fusibility responses, and 3) generate cDNA libraries from these                
              tissues.  This effort will yield the materials necessary to pursue             
              subtractive hybridization as a strategy for isolating the genes of             
              interest.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              It is well known that vertebrate animals have well developed immune            
              mechanisms for rejection of foreign tissues, but little is known               
              about such mechanisms in invertebrates.  The proposed research                 
              represents a collaborative effort between an invertebrate zoologist            
              and a molecular immunologist.  Their ultimate goal is to accomplish            
              the first unambiguous characterization of the molecules involved               
              in an invertebrate self-recognition (tissue-type) response.  The               
              results of this research ultimately should resolve the long-                   
              standing question of the phylogenetic relationships of invertebrate            
              and vertebrate self-recognition and immune-like defense responses.
