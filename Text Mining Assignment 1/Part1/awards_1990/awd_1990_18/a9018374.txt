              Description: This grant provides support for a joint                           
              research by a U.S. team headed by Dr. John W. Leibacher of                     
              the National Solar Observatory (NSO) in Tucson, AZ, and an                     
              Indian team headed by Dr. A. Bhatnagar, Director of the                        
              Udaipur Solar Observatory (USO) in Udaipur, India.  The                        
              research, in its first phase, will cover site evaluation of                    
              Udaipur as one of six sites for the Global Oscillation                         
              Network Group (GONG) project.  The GONG project seeks to                       
              obtain information through observations, made at different                     
              sites on the surface of the earth, of the oscillations at                      
              the surface of the sun, the earth's nearest star.                              
              Helioseismology, the study of these solar oscillations, has                    
              been developed as a new powerful tool that can probe the                       
              solar interior with considerable precision much in the same                    
              way that terrestial seismology reveals information about the                   
              interior of the earth.  Because the instruments and the                        
              program of observation to be used during the second phase                      
              are quite sensitive and complicated, it is important to run                    
              certain evaluative experiments on the various sites under                      
              consideration around the globe, including the Udaipur site,                    
              before making the final selection of the six sites.                            
                                                                                             
              Scope:  Indian scientists have contributed significantly to                    
              the field of solar physics.  The USO has a unique                              
              geographical location being in an area of considerable                         
              atmospheric clarity and at approximately opposite position                     
              around the globe to the NSO in Tucson.  The support of the                     
              Government of India (GOI) will be crucial for the success of                   
              the experiments.  This grant will enable the U.S. team to                      
              conduct the necessary preliminary tests and to negotiate                       
              with the GOI the required facilities from different                            
              governmental agencies.                                                         
                                                                                             
              Funding:  This project is being funded under two grants as                     
              follows:
