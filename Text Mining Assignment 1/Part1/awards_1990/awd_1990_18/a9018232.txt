Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Most of the water used by the developing fetus comes from the                  
              mother and appears to be regulated by the mother.  However, fetus              
              may have available to it a way to regulate its own fluid volume.               
              Recently, the heart of the fetus has been shown to contain a                   
              substance-atrial natriuretic peptide that, when secreted into the              
              blood, apppears to alter the blood volume of the fetus.  The                   
              ability of the fetus to increase its plasma ANP concentration in               
              response to volume expansion may be a mechanism used and                       
              controlled by the fetus to eliminate any excess fluid received                 
              from the mother.  The purpose of this proposal is to determine                 
              how ANP interacts with other developing systems in the fetus to                
              maintain its fluid volume within normal limits.//
