Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              Radiochemical investigations will be made on material from two                 
              well studied systems (Endeavour Ridge and the S. Juan de Fuca                  
              Ridge) which have been shown to have specific, different                       
              chemical and physical characteristics.  These differences may                  
              be related to variations in particular process timescales                      
              which, in turn, can be resolved by radioisotopic studies.  The                 
              focus of this work will fall on two aspects of these systems:                  
                                                                                             
              1)  The crustal residence time of the hydrothermal fluids will                 
              be studied by measurements of 210Pb/Pb, 228Ra/226Ra and on the                 
              venting fluids.                                                                
                                                                                             
              2)  Chemical scavenging rates and particle settling within the                 
              hydrothermal effluent plume will be studied by measurements of                 
              210Pb, 210Po and Th isotopes on water samples and suspended                    
              vent and plume particles.
