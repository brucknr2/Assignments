Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              A newly developed atomic absorption instrument dramatically                    
              improves the technical capabilities of Zeeman graphite furnace                 
              atomic absorption.  A DC permanent magnet system and other                     
              improvements in optics and electronics leads to a 5-10 fold                    
              improvement in detection limits for certain key elements.  This                
              improvement will enable the analysis of samples which were                     
              previously too small and also will allow for more efficient                    
              laboratory operation.  For example, Cd/Ca analysis in                          
              foraminifera requires several hours of microscopic examination                 
              and separation before sufficient specimens are found, and in                   
              some important samples, there are insufficient individuals for                 
              analysis in the largest available sample.  The instrument has                  
              the capability to do both flame and graphite furnace work, and                 
              so also will address a looming problem concerning the                          
              repairability of our 19-year old flame atomic absorption                       
              instrument.
