Abstract    :
              This project is to distinguish the mantle helium isotopic                      
              signature with new measurements of deeply buried diamonds from                 
              kimberlites of various ages.  The helium isotopic measurements                 
              combined with IR spectroscopy and cathodeluminescence microscopy               
              will make it possible to relate the isotopic data to diamond                   
              mineralogy.  Laser dissection of individual diamonds will                      
              eliminate the possible effects of alpha particle implantation,                 
              resolve variations within individual diamonds.  Studies of                     
              several new alluvial localities will allow an assessment of the                
              importance of cosmic-ray-produced 3He to the diamond work.
