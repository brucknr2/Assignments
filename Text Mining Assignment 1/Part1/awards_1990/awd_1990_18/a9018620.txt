Abstract    :
                   The PI will continue investigations aimed at furthering                   
              understanding of the kinematics and dynamics of the secular                    
              variation, seeking to provide useful constraints on theories of                
              the geodynamo.  This work is largely based on the use of                       
              observations in the form of a time-varying model of the magnetic               
              field at the core-mantle boundary.  Specific areas of attention                
              include:  1. the determination of the pattern of fluid flow at                 
              the top of the core; 2. forward modeling techniques to provide                 
              simple explanations of observed phenomena in the magnetic field,               
              and to examine the importance of particular physical processes in              
              the core and lower mantle; 3. investigation of the short-period                
              secular variation and especially the search for wave-like                      
              phenomena in the core; 4. examination of the dynamics of                       
              compositional convection, and possible growth of a stable layer                
              near the core surface.
