Abstract    :
              This a petrologic, geochemical and isotopic (Pb, Sr, Nd & O)                   
              study of a comprehensive suite of lower crustal and mantle                     
              xenoliths that occur in Tertiary age (50 Ma) alkaline rocks of                 
              the Bearpaw Mountains, north central Montana.  The grant will                  
              support research of the PI, will provide funding for a graduate                
              student (Mr. Yoram Meroz) and will contribute to the support of                
              the isotope geochemistry facility in Earth Sciences that is under              
              the directorship of the PI.  The xenoliths represent a unique                  
              sampling of material from a wide variety of levels within the                  
              Wyoming craton lithosphere down to a depth of at least 100km.                  
              They should provide information on the chemical evolution, age,                
              and physical properties of deep continental crust and ther                     
              underlying lithospheric mantle.
