Abstract    :
              Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University is establishing the        
              Charles Minor Engineering Fellowship Program to encourage women,               
              minorities, and persons with disabilities to pursue a Ph.D. in                 
              engineering.  Nine departments within the College of Engineering will          
              compete internally for Charles Minor Engineering Fellowships.  The             
              project director of the Fellowship Program is Dean of the College of           
              Engineering.  An advisory committee and a selection committee will             
              assist him.  Once named a fellow, each student will be assigned a              
              mentor, and fellows will be assured of support throughout their academic       
              career.  An aggressive ten-step recruitment plan for potential                 
              applicants has been developed.  Two important initiatives include (1)          
              locating Tech alumni and (2) approaching corporations and federal              
              agencies that employ large numbers of engineers.
