Abstract    :
              The long term goal of this project is to understand the                        
              biosynthesis of cytokinins, a class of plant growth hormone.  The              
              project focuses on the first enzyme in the cytokinin biosynthetic              
              pathway: 5'-AMP-isopentenyltransferase (ITPase).  This enzyme has              
              been detected in cultured cytokinin-habituated tobacco tissue that             
              will serve as a source of this enzyme for further purification                 
              using conventional methods (batch, columns, HPLC).  Antibodies                 
              against this partially purified enzyme will be produced and                    
              purified by passing the antiserum through a Sepharose-4B column                
              coupled to soluble proteins obtained from the cytokinin-dependent              
              tobacco tissue which lacks IPTase activity.  The purified antibody             
              preparation will be used for immunoaffinity chromatography to                  
              further purify the enzyme.  The kinetic properties of the enzyme               
              will be studied.                                                               
                                                                                             
              The enzyme ITPase is the first enzyme in the cytokinin biosynthetic            
              pathway.  It is likely to catalyze the rate-limiting step in                   
              cytokinin biosynthesis.  An enzyme with similar catalytic                      
              properties but not genetically homologous to the plant enzyme has              
              been isolated from plants transformed by Agrobacterium tumefaciens.            
              Unfortunately the lack of homology between the Agrobacterium IPTase            
              gene and plant sequences means that the gene for the plant enzyme              
              must be obtained by conventional means.  This project is the first             
              step toward isolating the gene for the IPTase of plants.                       
              Understanding the regulation of this gene in plants is important               
              to our overall understanding of growth and development in plants.
