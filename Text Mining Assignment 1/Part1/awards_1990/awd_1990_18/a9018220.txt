Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The northern Great Bahama Bank "ramp" will be studied using high-              
              resolution seismic profiles to locate rock and sediment cores to               
              document the sea-level rise and carbonate cycle evolution on a                 
              carbonate ramp and thereby be extended to interpretative models for            
              ancient analogs.
