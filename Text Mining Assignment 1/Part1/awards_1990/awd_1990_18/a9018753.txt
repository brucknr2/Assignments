Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This renewal proposal is aimed at an application of variable angle             
              spinning combined with separated local field spectroscopy to study             
              the orientational ordering of three types of new ferroelectric                 
              liquid crystals.  The order parameters of several series of liquid             
              crystals with non-linear core structures will also be measured to              
              determine the orientation of the nematic director in the molecular             
              framework of these compounds.
