Abstract    :
              This is a proposal to develop the DNA sequencing technology using              
              the atomic force microscope (AFM).  AFM can image surfaces at                  
              submolecular resolution by scanning a sharp tip over the surface,              
              and under favorable conditions, and has resolved individual                    
              nucleotides of DNA.  In this project, feasibility studies will be              
              carried out to determine if, in fact, reliable methods could be                
              developed for AFM to actually sequence DNA molecules.  If                      
              successful, the new method could allow DNA sequencing at least                 
              100 times faster than the currently available technology.
