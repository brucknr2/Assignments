Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                     New oceanic crust forms along the mid.ocean ridge axis by a            
              complex interplay of magmatic, tectonic, and hydrothermal                      
              processes. These processes are known to vary significantly along               
              the axis, as manifested by the division of the ridge into                      
              segments bounded by transform faults and overlapping spreading                 
              centers. Hydrothermal venting along the mid.ocean ridge is a                   
              first.order process that is responsibe for much of the heat loss               
              from the ridge axis. This project will determine the                           
              distributions, relative intensity, and first.order chemical                    
              characteristics of hydrothermal venting along the                              
              morphologically, geophysically, and pertologically well.known                  
              segments of the East Pacific Rise between 9 03N and 11 10N by                  
              surveying the water column for hydrothermal plumes. This section               
              of the ridge was chosen because it is well.studied, and because                
              it encompasses portions of mid.ocean ridge with high magma supply              
              as well as portions that are magmatically starved.
