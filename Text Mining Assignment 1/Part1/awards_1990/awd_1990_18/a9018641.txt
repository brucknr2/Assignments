Abstract    :
                   This project is directed towards establishing improved                    
              analytical procedures for accurate electron microprobe analysis of             
              major, minor and trace elements in non-conducting materials, with              
              special emphasis on silicates, oxides and carbonates of interest               
              to earth and materials scientists. The result will be a set of                 
              correction factors for reducing the characteristic X-ray                       
              intensities that are directly measured by the electron probe to                
              accurate quantitative chemical compositions of such materials.                 
              Increased accuracy in quantitative microanalysis is of interest                
              for all fields of science dealing with small-scale chemical                    
              variations in solid materials.
