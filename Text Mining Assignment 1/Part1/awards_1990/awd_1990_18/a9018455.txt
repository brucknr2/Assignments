Abstract    :
              Professor Zilm is supported by a grant from the Experimental                   
              Physical Chemistry Program to study the structure of metastable                
              molecular fragments captured in a low temperature matrix using                 
              nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques for high resolution                
              studies in the solid state.  These studies should provide                      
              information on the nature of the intermediates formed during                   
              the course of a chemical reaction and thus further our                         
              understanding of how chemical reactions occur.                                 
                                                                                             
              A combination of the structure-specific information from                       
              high-resolution techniques of solid state NMR and the matrix                   
              isolation techniques for reactive intermediates have been                      
              demonstrated by Zilm as a useful tool for the transient species                
              produced in a chemical reaction.  With new NMR techniques that                 
              he has developed he will investigate the structure of singlet                  
              biradicals, singlet carbenes and silylenes, singlet nitrenes,                  
              ynols, and other species.  Dipolar couplings and therefore                     
              internuclear distances and relative orientations of bonds will                 
              provide detailed structure, and chemical shift tensors will                    
              provide additional information about the electron distribution                 
              in these fragments.  Sensitivity of the NMR techniques will be                 
              increased by operating at 20 K.
