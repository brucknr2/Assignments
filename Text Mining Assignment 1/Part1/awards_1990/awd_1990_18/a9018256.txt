Abstract    :
                   This award will provide partial support for publication of                
              the Proceedings of the 1991 Particle Accelerator Conference;                   
              San Francisco, California; May 6-9, 1991, organized by the                     
              Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).  The                 
              conference will focus upon new developments in the science and                 
              technology and use of accelerators.  Its purpose is to provide                 
              an opportunity for communication among accelerator scientists,                 
              engineers, and others concerned with accelerator applications.                 
              The program includes reports from all the major accelerator                    
              laboratories throughout the world.
