Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Drs. Atkinson, Hunten, and Lunine at the University of Arizona will            
              use a broadly applicable laboratory spectroscopy technique to study            
              the detailed characteristics of several absorption bands of methane            
              and molecules of ammonia and hydrogen, and to perform low                      
              resolution broadband measurements of the 619 nanometer and 725                 
              nanometer bands of methane, which have been studied with prior NSF             
              support.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              Study of planetary atmospheres relies heavily on spectroscopic                 
              measurements of molecular absorption lines such as those of                    
              methane, ammonia, and hydrogen.  Among the necessary data are                  
              molecular line intensities and collisional broadening ceofficients,            
              particularly at low temperatures.  Over the past two years Dr.                 
              Atkinson and colleagues have developed and validated an intracavity            
              laser spectroscopy (ILS) technique which was used to measure line              
              intensities and pressure broadening coefficients of narrow lines               
              in the 619 nanometer band of methane.  They also developed a                   
              technique for using ILS to make broadband, low resolution,                     
              measurements necessary for interpreting filter photometry.  With               
              the current grant these scientists will expand these ILS                       
              measurements to other wavelength bands and molecular species of                
              interest in planetary sciences.
