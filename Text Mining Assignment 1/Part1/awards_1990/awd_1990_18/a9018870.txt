Abstract    :
              Although granitic magmas are often invoked as sources of                       
              hydrothermal ore solutions, very little direct evidence exists                 
              for a genetic link between a specific mineral deposit and a                    
              specific magmatic body.  This link may be provided by studying                 
              the Capitan Pluton and its associated quartz-allanite                          
              mineralization.  The evolution and composition of the magmatic                 
              fluid phase can be modeled using the constraints provided by the               
              existing detailed geochemistry of the Capitan pluton.  This will               
              be compared with the composition of the actual magmatic fluids                 
              which were responsible for mineralization.  Vein minerals                      
              (quartz, allanite and titanite) and their trapped fluid                        
              inclusions will be analyzed for stable isotope, elemental and gas              
              compositions.  Comparison of the measured fluid composition and                
              the computer-modeled composition should provide insight into the               
              processes involved in magmatic aqueous fluid evolution.
