Abstract    :
                   The aim of this project is to investigate the basic                       
              hydrodynamics and magnetohydrodynamics of black hole systems.                  
              The research approach is numerical; the black hole physics is                  
              modeled using large-scale, multidimensional finite-                            
              differencing.  A three-dimensional, general relativistic code                  
              will be used to investigate the nonlinear behavior of                          
              nonaxisymmetric disk instabilities in pressure-supported                       
              accretion tori.  This research will be extended to studies of                  
              three-dimensional accretion flows, to the transport of angular                 
              momentum through disks by nonaxisymmetric hydrodynamic waves,                  
              and to effects due to frame dragging by Kerr holes.  Black                     
              hole accretion systems also produce outflows in the form of                    
              highly collimated jets.  Magnetohydrodynamic jet collimation                   
              processes will be studied with a two-dimensional Newtonian                     
              code.  The jet systems SS433 and Sc0 X-1 will be modeled with                  
              this code to determine whether magnetic forces can account for                 
              the observed jet focusing.  In addition, work will continue on                 
              a fully-relativistic computer program, which will be applied                   
              to increasingly complex problems involving jet collimation,                    
              focusing, and generation, as well as to the extraction of                      
              energy from rotating black holes.
