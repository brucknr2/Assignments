Abstract    :
              The principal investigator, in collaboration with John Shervais                
              at the  University of South Carolina, will continue their                      
              study of the northern Coast Range ophiolite in California.  Field              
              relations, uranium-lead and argon-argon dating techniques,                     
              petrology, and geochemistry will be used in the Elder Creek area               
              to constrain the origin and time of intrusion of several                       
              different magma series, the relationships between each magma                   
              series and between plutonic and extrusive suites, and the                      
              tectonic history of this ophiolite in relation to other adjacent               
              units.  The same techniques will be employed in the Stonyford                  
              area to understand its age, origin, and tectonic history.  The                 
              research will shed new light on the geologic history of this                   
              complex plate boundary.
