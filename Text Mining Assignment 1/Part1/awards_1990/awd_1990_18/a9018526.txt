Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              This award supports a program to develop observationally testable              
              models of the formation and evolution of galaxies by a leading                 
              young computational astrophysicist.  Self consistent numerical                 
              models including both stellar and gas-dynamical effects will be                
              constructed to take advantage of recent advances in hardware and               
              software.  In addition to generating testabnle predictions, the                
              codes to be developed will be made available to the astronomical               
              community to ensure widest possible use and testing.
