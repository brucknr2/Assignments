Abstract    :
              This special minority award will give Ph.D. student Christopher                
              J.                                                                             
              Davis additional flexibility in pursuing his graduate studies and              
              research in economics.  This award will strengthen minority                    
              research participation in economics.  More specifically, the                   
              grant                                                                          
              will permit Davis to strengthen his understanding of economic                  
              theory by studying the mathematics on which modern economics                   
              depends.
