Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The P.I. has developed a finite difference model that                     
              describes the evolution of stretching and rifting along passive                
              continental margins. Funding has been granted for the P.I. to                  
              reconcile his theoretical studies with observational data from                 
              the margins of the U.S. east cost and Red Sea. An attempt will                 
              be made to account for the asymmetric nature of rifting, the                   
              shifting of the locus of maximum extension with time, and the                  
              distribution of uplift and magmatism prior to and during                       
              rifting. This model needs no a apriori assumptions regarding                   
              the character of shearing as either "simple" or "pure", acommon                
              starting point that limits other modeling techniques in their                  
              ability to duplicate the variety of features that typify rifted                
              margins.
