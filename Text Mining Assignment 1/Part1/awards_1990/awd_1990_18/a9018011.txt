Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The purpose of the workshop is to discuss ways in which the NSF                
              supercomputer centers can promote computational science and                    
              engineering in the education of pre-college, college and                       
              university students.  The target audiences for the workshop                    
              recommendations will be educators and their institutions, high                 
              performance computing centers and funding bodies.
