Abstract    :
                   A significant anthropological problem in adaptational                     
              studies is how humans adapt to high altitudes.  It has been                    
              demonstrated that not all human groups possess the same                        
              phenotypic responses to hypoxia.  Because of the variation in                  
              conditions of previous studies, it has been difficult to                       
              determine whether phenotypic differences among high altitude                   
              populations in the Andes, the Himalayas and elsewhere are related              
              to genetic differences, to differences in genotype-environmental               
              interactions during development, to differences in nutrition and               
              or disease, or to differences in barometric pressure that may                  
              exist between mountainous regions above and below the equator.                 
                   This pilot study will explore in a systematic way the causes              
              of population differences in phenotypic response to hypoxia among              
              genetically similar and genetically diverse populations living                 
              above 3500 meters in one geographical area--Quinghai Province,                 
              China--thereby avoiding variations in study conditions that have               
              hampered previous comparisons.  The study will be carried out in               
              collaboration with researchers from Beijing Medical University                 
              and the Xining First Hospital.
