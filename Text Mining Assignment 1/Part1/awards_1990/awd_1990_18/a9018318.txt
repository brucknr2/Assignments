Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The research proposed will use T-DNA tagged mutants in Arabidopsis             
              to identify and isolate genes related to photosynthesis in this                
              model plant, and seeks to determine the roles of these genes in                
              photosynthetic development and other functions.  The tagged genes              
              of two albino mutants and their corresponding wild-type alleles                
              will be examined in the effort to reach the goals stated.  The                 
              effects of the tagged mutations on the molecular phenotype of                  
              mutant plants will be examined, and the properties of encoded                  
              proteins assessed in the effort to reach mechanistic explanations              
              for association of phenotype and mutant.                                       
                                                                                             
              Many mutations in the photosynthetic process lead to pleiotropic               
              molecular phenotypes and this makes difficult deriving a                       
              mechanistic explanation of the relationship between a phenotype and            
              a mutant.  Use of T-DNA tagged genes in mutants and wild types                 
              should permit a precise correlation between isolated genes and                 
              their functions in photosynthesis.
