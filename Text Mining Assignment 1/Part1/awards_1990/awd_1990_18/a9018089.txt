Abstract    :
                   Laser light scattering will be used to study several phenomena            
              and processes that are of basic interest in condensed matter                   
              physics.  These are:  critical behavior near a non-symmetric                   
              tricritical point in water/alcohol/oil mixtures; phase separation              
              of liquid mixtures suddenly rendered thermodynamically unstable;               
              the properties of fractal networks of silica grown in solution,                
              which are the precursors of certain glasses, and the effect such               
              networks have on phase separation and critical phenomena in liquid             
              mixtures.                                                                      
                   The measurements will be carried out using a unique and very              
              accurate laser light-scattering instrument developed with prior NSF            
              support, which measures the absolute scattering cross-section and              
              its wave-vector dependence down to very small scattering angles.               
              It is also used to measure the decay-rate of the spontaneous                   
              fluctuations responsible for the scattering of light.  This joint              
              capability is very useful since it provides accurate results for               
              thermodynamic susceptibilities, static length scales and dynamic               
              behavior.  This provides stringent tests of theories relating                  
              dynamic properties to static ones.
