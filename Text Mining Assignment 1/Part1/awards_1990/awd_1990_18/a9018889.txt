Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Cell-cell recognition is a fundamental biological process which                
              underlies many critical developmental events. An example of a                  
              process which relies heavily on cell-cell interactions is                      
              fertilization in higher plants. The research described in this                 
              proposal is designed to contribute to our understanding of the                 
              mechanisms which are involved in these cell-cell interactions, as              
              well as to increase our knowledge of how these interactions act                
              to regulate the fertilization process. A genetic approach will be              
              used to identify mutations in Arabidopsis thaliana which disrupt               
              the process of fertilization and these mutations will be                       
              characterized to determine which are involved in cell-cell                     
              interactions. The genes identified by the mutations will be                    
              cloned using a combination of RFLP mapping and "chromosome                     
              walking". The cloned genes will then be used to characterized the              
              expression patterns and products of the genes. In a parallel                   
              project, a small family of Arabidopsis genes showing sequence                  
              similarity to those involved in self-recognition during                        
              fertilization in Brassica oleracea will be characterized to                    
              determine if any members of the family play a role in other                    
              recognition events during fertilization. By identifying and                    
              characterizing gene products which are part of the interaction                 
              process we will learn about the molecular mechanisms of these                  
              interactions.
