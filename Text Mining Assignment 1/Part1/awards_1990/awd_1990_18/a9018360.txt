Abstract    :
                   Paleozoic positions and orientations of the cratonic blocks               
              and terranes that constitute present-day Asia are not well known,              
              but this information is required from both paleogeographic and                 
              global geophysical stand points.  This project will utilize                    
              recently-discovered Ordovician and Silurian strata from the western            
              margin of the North China Block to determine paleomagnetic pole                
              positions for these terranes.  Results will help unravel the                   
              tectonic history of China and provide a paleomagnetic reference                
              frame for determining relative displacements and times of accretion            
              of blocks and terranes both within and outside China.
