Abstract    :
                This research is to apply seismic inversion methods to seismic               
              refraction and wide angle reflection data in order to obtain                   
              velocity, anisotropy and attenuation model parameters.  A seismic              
              pulse model will be developed and used to invert travel-times,                 
              amplitudes, and periods from refraction data for a combined                    
              velocity and attenuation structure.  These inversion techniques                
              will be applied to data from the 1986 PASSCAL Ouachita and 1986                
              GLIMPCE OBS experiments.
