Abstract    :
                   This award provides 50% funding for the acquisition of a                  
              computer system to be installed in the Department of Geology and               
              Geophysics at the University of California, Berkeley. The                      
              University of California is committed to providing the remaining               
              funds needed. The primary use of the computer system will be in                
              numerical modeling of convection and flow in the Earth's mantle and            
              related geodynamic processes.
