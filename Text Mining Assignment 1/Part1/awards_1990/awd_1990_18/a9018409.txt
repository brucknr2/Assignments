Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will determine the distribution of the shallower                  
              branch of the deep western boundary current delineated by a                    
              distinct core of water with high CFM at 4-5 deg. C.  The                       
              identification of sources for this water in the southern Labrador              
              Sea and the processes leading to its formation and modification                
              are primary objectives of this field program.  Variations in the               
              formation of deep western boundary currents are hypothesized as a              
              major contributor to widespread climate changes.
