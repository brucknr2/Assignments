Abstract    :
              The komatiites of the lower formations of the Barberton                        
              greenstone belt have been extensively studied, but little is                   
              known of the widespread komatiites of the upper portions of the                
              Barberton greenstone belt.  This project will be a comprehensive               
              study of these upper komatiites, including:  1) geochronology,                 
              stratigraphy, and correlations with other upper greenstone belt                
              structural units; and, 2) petrogenesis, especially of the                      
              volumetrically important, though very unusual, high Al/Ti                      
              komatiites.  The proposed work will be conducted in the ICM-MS                 
              lab at MIT, and in southern Africa while the PI is on sabbatical               
              leave from LSU.  Analytical procedures for REE, and PGE analyses               
              by ICP-MS will then take place at the new ICP-MS facility at LSU.
