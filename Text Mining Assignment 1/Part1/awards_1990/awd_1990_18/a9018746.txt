Abstract    :
              The goal of the University of Michigan project is to recruit, mentor           
              and graduate African Americans, and women with Ph.D. degrees in                
              engineering who can go on to become faculty members and role models for        
              others.  Students will be recruited through individual interviews from         
              a number of small but distinguished regional schools and historically          
              black Colleges.  Career plans, desire to succeed and help others, and          
              academic credentials will be the main selection criteria.  After               
              selection the seven GEE project students will go through a week long           
              orientation program to sharpen the success skills such as time                 
              management, study habits, familiarity with the university, as well as          
              identifying the academic shortcomings in their backgrounds for remedial        
              course work as needed.  Each student will have a faculty mentor and role       
              model who will work closely with the student throughout the Ph.D.              
              program.  The Gee project will be used as a catalyst to refine                 
              recruiting and retention methods for underrepresented groups.
