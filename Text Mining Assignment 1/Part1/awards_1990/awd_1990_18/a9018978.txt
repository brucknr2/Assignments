Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              As a continuation of the geochronological and geochemical                      
              studies in the hotspot lineaments of French Polynesia, helium                  
              concentrations and isotopic ratios will be run by D. Desonie as                
              a post-doctoral study with R. Duncan (OSU). This geochemical                   
              work will be done on submarine basalt glasses and olivine                      
              phyric basalts from the OSU a collection as well as other                      
              samples obtained by OSTROM (France). The helium analyses will                  
              be done in Mark Kurz's lab at WHOI.
