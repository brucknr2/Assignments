Abstract    :
              The principal investigators will study the Lilloise Intrusion of               
              East Greenland.  In particular, they hope to discover the nature               
              of the mantle-derived magmas from which this deposit formed, and               
              to relate this to present-day igneous events in Iceland.  This                 
              study also will have important geological implications relative                
              to crust/mantle interactions during the initial stages of rifting              
              of the North Atlantic.
