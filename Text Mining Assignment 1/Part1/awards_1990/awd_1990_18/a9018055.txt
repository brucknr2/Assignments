Abstract    :
              This award will support an investigation of transverse                         
              geologic structure within the Transantarctic Mountains                         
              (TAM), a major intracontinental mountain belt that developed                   
              along the crustal boundary between the subcontinents of East                   
              and West Antarctic.  The TAM appear to be a rift-margin                        
              uplift related to extensional tectonism within the Antarctic                   
              Plate during the Mesozoic and Cenozoic.  Offsets in the TAM                    
              suggest an along-strike structural segmentation analogous to                   
              that seen in other continental rift systems.  In contrast to                   
              other rift systems, however, there is no change in tilt                        
              direction between segments, and transverse structures in the                   
              TAM are associated with physiographic troughs that may                         
              represent tensional "pull apart" zones.  Kinematic analysis                    
              will establish the displacement direction(s) associated with                   
              these structures, and provide a test for models invoking                       
              extension and translation between East and West Antarctica                     
              during rift development.  Documentation of the positions and                   
              character of these transverse structures will provide a 3-D                    
              picture of the rift system that will constrain process-                        
              oriented models of rift development and TAM uplift.                            
              Comparison of TAM segmentation with that of other rift                         
              systems will serve to evaluate controls on along-axis rift                     
              propagation as continental lithosphere is stretched prior to                   
              breakup.
