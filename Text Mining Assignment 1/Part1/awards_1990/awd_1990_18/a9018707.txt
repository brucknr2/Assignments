Abstract    :
              The broad, long-term objective of this work is to elucidate                    
              the rules that govern protein folding.  Bovine pancreatic                      
              trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) has been chosen as a model system                     
              because it is a simple globular polypeptide, and a large                       
              amount of structural biophysical, and theoretical data is                      
              already available for the wild type protein.  The basic                        
              thrust will be to produce, in quantity, genetically-modified                   
              forms of BPTI that have perturbed folding properties and                       
              characterize these biophysically.  Specific Research                           
              priorities are:                                                                
                   1)  Address the problem of "designing out" disulfide                      
              bonds by making BPTI mutants missing two or more of the                        
              native disulfides.                                                             
                                                                                             
                   2) Facilitate work in collaborators' laboratories on the                  
              structure and dynamics of selected BPTI mutants.                               
                                                                                             
                   This combined genetic and biophysical approach to the                     
              dissection of the folding mechanism of a very simple model                     
              protein should help illuminate the still poorly-understood                     
              process of protein folding.
