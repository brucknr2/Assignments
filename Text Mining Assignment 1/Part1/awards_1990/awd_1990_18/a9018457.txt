Abstract    :
              The Marquette University Department of Electrical and Computer                 
              Engineering plans to establish a Graduate Engineering Education (GEE)          
              Program of study, research, and academic support for students from             
              underrepresented backgrounds.  All aspects of the program will be              
              focused directly on the timely completion of a doctoral degree in signal       
              processing, and the preparation and motivation for a career in                 
              university teaching and research in electrical and computer engineering.       
              The five year GEE program will provide financial, academic,                    
              professional, and personal support for three GEE Fellows in each program       
              year.  It is anticipated that students will complete their degrees in          
              three to five years, allowing room for new participants in year four.
