Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will study the origin and history of                
              cogenetic silica undersaturated and silica saturated igneous                   
              rocks.  Specifically, he will address the question of whether the              
              latter can be related to the former via incorporation of silica-               
              rich crustal components.  Rocks from four specific localities                  
              will be investigated using petrographic, major and trace element               
              analytical, geochronologic, and stable isotope techniques.  The                
              processes to be studied are likely to be common ones.  The                     
              research results thus will have potentially wide applicability in              
              helping geologists understand the origins of plutonic igneous                  
              rocks.
