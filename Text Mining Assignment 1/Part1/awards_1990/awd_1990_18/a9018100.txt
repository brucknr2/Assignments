Abstract    :
                   The Eocene echinoid fauna of Africa is among the richest in               
              the world with 145 nominal species of spatangoids from all Eocene              
              stages.  Preliminary analyses of spatangoid distributions in Egypt             
              suggest that there existed in the Eocene geographic regions with               
              distinct echinoid communities, and that these were a result of                 
              differences in sediment type in different regions.                             
                   Burrowing echinoids, particularly spatangoids, have test                  
              features whose functional relationship with the sediment in which              
              they live is well understood.  I propose to analyze functional                 
              morphology of Egyptian and other African species to determine their            
              substrate preferences.  The proportions of species with specific               
              sediment preferences in the fauna of each sampling locality will               
              be plotted to see if any geographic distribution of sediment                   
              corresponds to the apparent faunal distinctiveness and rocks                   
              containing them will confirm inferences of sedimentary facies from             
              echinoid morphology.                                                           
                   Inferences about the causes for biogeographic distributions               
              on a global scale require stratigraphically and ecologically well              
              understood samples such as will be generated by this research.
