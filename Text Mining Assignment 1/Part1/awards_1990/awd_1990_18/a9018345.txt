Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              One of the most fundamental processes inherent in animal cells is              
              the capacity to transport ions and water.  These processes are                 
              very important in the functioning of the human body, for example,              
              in the production of saliva, sweat, urine, stomach secretions                  
              etc.                                                                           
                                                                                             
              Dr. Bradley is studying insects that live in a very saline lake,               
              Mono Lake, in east central California.  This lake is 2.5 times as              
              salty as the ocean and contains very high levels of sulfate.                   
              Despite these unusual conditions, brine flies live by the                      
              billions in Mono Lake.  He is investigating the mechanisms of                  
              salt transport in the midgut (the site of salt entry) and hindgut              
              (the site of salt exit) in these flies.  The flies may well                    
              contain the most active sulfate pumps known in biology.  He                    
              anticipates that the information he will gather will be of broad               
              use in understanding the mechanisms of salt transport in other                 
              biological systems and in man, for example in the kidney.                      
                                                                                             
              It is a well established practice to examine physiological                     
              processes in non-human model systems where the process is highly               
              exaggerated.  Electrical generation has been very successfully                 
              studied in electric eels, nervous function in the giant axons of               
              squid and processes of genetic selection in the fruit fly which                
              has very short generation times.  He intends to use the same                   
              principle in examining sulfate transport in the most active                    
              sulfate system known.
