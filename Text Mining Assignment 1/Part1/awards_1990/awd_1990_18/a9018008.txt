Abstract    :
                   The dynamics of western boundary currents in the ocean                    
              will be considered in this work.  This theoretical investigation               
              will address the problem of recirculation by analyzing the                     
              transformation of properties such as potential vorticity as the                
              current departs from the western margin of the ocean.  In                      
              addition, the work will address the context of separation in the               
              larger ocean energy balance.
