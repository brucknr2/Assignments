Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This is a theoretical study of the dynamic processes                      
              shaping mantle flow beneath mid-ocean spreading centers.                       
              three dimensional numerical models of flow beneath a spreading                 
              center will be constructed to try to explain observed bulls-eye                
              gravity anomalies along slow-spreading ridges and their absence                
              along intermediate and fast spreading ridges. The models will                  
              include the irreversible effects of melting on shaping the                     
              density structure and will explore the effects of spatial,                     
              temperature, and composition dependent rheology.
