Abstract    :
                 Three different aspects of plant peroxisome biogenesis will be              
              pursued: (1), the means by which the expanding membrane of                     
              oilseed glyoxysomes acquires its protein and lipid is an integral              
              part of the organelle biogenesis.  The hypothesis will be tested               
              that lipid bodies contribute membrane lipid to differentiating                 
              oilseed glyoxysomes; (2), parameters and conditions necessary                  
              and/or sufficient for recognition and tranlocation in vivo of                  
              malate synthase, isocitrate lyase and catalase into peroxisomes                
              of cultured monkey kidney and selected plant cells will be                     
              determined; (3) studies will continue on deciphering patterns of               
              regulation and developmental expression of catalase isoforms                   
              during the changeover from glyoxysomes to leaf-type peroxisomes,               
              and of isocitrate lyase and malate synthase during glyoxysome                  
              differentiation in maturing and germinated seeds.  The                         
              availability of an embryo culture system is expected to provide a              
              unique means to help resolve regulation patterns within maturing               
              seeds.                                                                         
                                                                                             
              Peroxisomes occur in virtually all eukaryotic cells, conducting a              
              variety of essential metabolic functions depending on the cell                 
              type in which they reside.  They are not capable of synthesizing               
              their own phospholipids or proteins, and are therefore dependent               
              upon the selective and complicated intracellular trafficking                   
              mechanisms responsible for their biogenesis.  The objectives of                
              this proposal are to examine the molecular and biochemical bases               
              of selected, interrelated aspects of peroxisome biogenesis; the                
              emphasis will be on cottonseed glyoxysomes.
