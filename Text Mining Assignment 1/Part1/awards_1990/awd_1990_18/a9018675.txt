Abstract    :
                   This award provides partial funding for the support of a                  
              research technician for a period of three year. The technician will            
              be working in the isotope geochemistry facility in the Department              
              of Earth Sciences at the University of California in Santa Cruz.               
                   The technician will support the work of five senior                       
              researchers and their graduate students in common-access                       
              laboratories. The primary instrumentation is a multi-collector,                
              high mass resolution mass spectrometer. The group's research                   
              focuses on the chemical evolution of the Earth's crust and mantle              
              from earliest pre-Cambrian time to the present, using isotopic                 
              analysis for dating processes and tracing mass transfers.
