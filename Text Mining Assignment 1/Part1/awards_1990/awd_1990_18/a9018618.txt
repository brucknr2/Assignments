Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The long term goal of this project is to understand the molecular              
              events underlying tissue growth and development. Working with                  
              Drosophila melanogaster, Dr. Blackman is studying the expression               
              of the decapentaplegic (dpp) gene in the group of cells, called                
              imaginal disks, that give rise to much of the adult's epidermis.               
              The dpp gene is a member of the TGF-beta family of secreted                    
              growth factors and is required for normal pattern formation in                 
              the developing disks. Its expression during disk growth is                     
              controlled by a 30 kb cis-regulatory region lying downstream (3')              
              of the transcription unit. Distributed throughout this region are              
              numerous regulatory elements, suggesting that many genes interact              
              with dpp to control its pattern of expression. During the project              
              period, Dr. Blackman proposes to: 1) continue his molecular                    
              analysis of the cis-regulatory sequences controlling dpp                       
              transcription in the imaginal disks and 2) identify genetically                
              those genes responsible for the trans-acting regulatory factors                
              which interact with these sequences. The products of the TGF-beta              
              family are involved in a broad range of growth regulatory events               
              in mammals, amphibians, and insects. While the vertebrate systems              
              have provided a wealth of information on the cell biology and                  
              biochemistry of the factors, Drosophila affords the ideal system               
              for examining the role of these molecules during development.
