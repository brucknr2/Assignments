Abstract    :
                   The high pressure polymorph of quartz, coesite, has been                  
              reported from metamorphic rocks in three mountain belts, and                   
              indicates subduction to depths in excess of 100km followed by                  
              return to the earth's surface.  This project will focus on the                 
              occurrence of coesite in the Dabie Mountains of east central China,            
              within a presumed suture zone between the Yangtze and Sino-Korean              
              cratons.  Major aims are to date the parent rock, the age of high              
              pressure metamorphism and the time of collision of the cratons.                
              The work also includes additional study of coesite-bearing                     
              eclogitic rocks within the Dora Maira massif in Italy and                      
              comparisons to the China occurrence.  Results will provide the                 
              basis for a better understanding of the relationship between                   
              subduction processes and the timing of ultra-high pressure meta-               
              morphism.
