Abstract    :
              The College of Engineering at Michigan State University project will           
              develop funding, recruiting and retention programs for women and               
              minorities seeking Ph.D. degrees.  The College will continue to recruit        
              these students to its nationally recognized research centers.  NSF funds       
              initially  will be used for support of six students while the College          
              develops recurring fellowship funding to provide long-term stability for       
              the program.  The efforts will emphasize recruitment of African                
              Americans and women.  The goal is to provide a four to five year funding       
              profile for outstanding Ph.D. students having the monetary advantages          
              of a fellowship while involving the student in regular research and            
              teaching.  The full fellowship during the first year permits the student       
              flexibility while choosing a research advisor.  During years 2 through         
              4, the student's primary support will be provided by research and              
              teaching assistantships.  This helps assure that the student contributes       
              to research and teaching, thereby acting as a role model for other             
              students.  Dissertation fellowships are available for the final year to        
              allow the student to complete papers and the dissertation.  During the         
              NSF award period, the NSF fellowship model would be used while Michigan        
              State University develops continuing endowments to operate the proposed        
              program.
