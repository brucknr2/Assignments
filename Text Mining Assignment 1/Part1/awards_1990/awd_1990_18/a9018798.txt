Abstract    :
              This research proposal deals with a novel class of transposons                 
              capable of intracellular as well as intercellular transposition.               
              Besides being causative agents for the horizontal spread of                    
              multiple antibiotic resistance among clinical streptococci, this               
              group of genetic elements has been shown to transfer from Gram                 
              positive to Gram negative bacteria.  Thus, an investigation of the             
              properties of these is of biological interest, and of medical                  
              relevance.  Experimental observations seem to indicate that the                
              larger conjugative transposons such as omegaBM6001 and omegaBM4200             
              are made of smaller discrete units at least one of which is capable            
              of independent movement when removed from its original context.                
              The objectives of the proposed study are to distinguish between and            
              to isolate the component units, and to identify the transfer                   
              related regions.  Recent experiments demonstrating the retention               
              of conjugal properties of the BM6001 element subsequent to the in              
              vivo deletion of a Tn916 like element from within it strongly                  
              suggest the existence of a separate class class of mobile elements             
              whose properties could be distinct from those of the Tn916 class               
              of elements.  Mutant donor strains would be created to define the              
              transfer-- related regions within the omegaBM6001 devoid of the tet            
              element.  The details of the preferred target sites for the                    
              omegaBM6001 and the omegaBM4200 elements would be obtained by                  
              dideoxy DNA sequencing.  The role of the termini and the preferred             
              target site of the BM6001 element in conjugal transfer would be                
              tested following construction of mutant strains carrying in vivo               
              induced deletions of these regions and using them in filter-mating             
              experiments.  Besides characterizing the structural and functional             
              details of this novel class of transposable DNA segments, the                  
              proposed investigation could enlarge our understanding of the                  
              origin and autoaccumulation of heterologous elements some of which             
              include antibiotic resistance determinants.
