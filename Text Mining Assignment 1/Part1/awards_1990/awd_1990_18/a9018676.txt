Abstract    :
                   The PI will carry out a research program of measuring sound               
              velocities and, hence, elastic properties of minerals and high-                
              pressure silicate phases by Brillouin light scattering experiments             
              on samples compressed to high pressures in diamond anvil cells.                
              These experiments will yield the pressure derivatives of elastic               
              properties, and will allow the properties of mineral assemblages               
              to be calculated for actual conditions within the Earth with much              
              greater confidence.  Although initial experiments will be made on              
              phases that ate thought to dominate the upper mantle, this                     
              technique can and will be applied to metallic and amorphous                    
              materials as well.  This research will require a concentrated                  
              effort to refine the experimental techniques involved with high                
              pressure Brillouin scattering, so that rapid and accurate                      
              measurements of pressure derivatives can be made.
