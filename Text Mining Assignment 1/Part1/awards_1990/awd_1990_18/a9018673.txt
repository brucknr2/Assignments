Abstract    :
                   This project seeks to create a disseminable, multi-functional,            
              inexpensive and well-documented laboratory course sequence, with the           
              primary goal of improving practical skills of undergraduate students           
              specializing in robotics, vision, AI and manufactoring disciplines.            
              The project will include the building of a robot, as well as                   
              supporting simulation and real-time software and hardware, and it will         
              develop comprehensive laboratory manuals to support an undergraduate           
              sequence of courses in robotics, AI and vision.  The laboratory will           
              be transportable.
