Abstract    :
                This research is to systematically determine temporal source                 
              properties of deep earthquakes including the source spectrum,                  
              seismic energies, stress drops, rise times, and durations from                 
              teleseismic broadband waveforms.  Recently available broadband                 
              digital seismograms from the Global Digital Seismic Network                    
              (GDSN) supported by NSF provide a valuable data set of waveforms               
              from deep earthquakes.  Preliminary results show no systematic                 
              change in stress drop with depth or moment for events from 10 to               
              670 km deep within subducting oceanic slabs, although the scatter              
              is large.  Rise times, however, become shorter for events deeper               
              that about 550 km.  Below 100 to 200 km depth, pressure and                    
              temperature in the subducting slab inhibit the brittle failure                 
              that causes earthquakes at shallower depths.  The goal of this                 
              research is to determine the physical process that allows deep                 
              earthquakes to occur, one of the outstanding problems in solid                 
              earth geophysics.
