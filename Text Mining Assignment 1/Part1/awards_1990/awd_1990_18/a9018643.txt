Abstract    :
                   Nonmarine molluscs are abundant animal macrofossils of                    
              uppermost Cretaceous and Paleocene continental strata in western               
              North America.  Their biochronologic potential, however, has yet               
              to be realized due primarily to the lack of study focused on                   
              biostratigraphic ranges of taxa in thick sequences of strata                   
              temporally controlled by correlation with fossil mammals.  The                 
              proposed study will construct a biostratigraphic and biochronologic            
              zonation of Lancian (uppermost Cretaceous), Puercan, Torrejonian,              
              and Tiffanian (lower, middle, upper Paleocene, respectively) strata            
              in the northern Great Plains.  The project will consist of the                 
              following parts:  1) Field work to stratigraphically organize known            
              Lancian age localities in the Hell Creek Formation of the Williston            
              Basin (Montana/North Dakota) and the Lance Formation in the Powder             
              River Basin (Montana/Wyoming), 2) field work to discover Puercan               
              and Torrejonian age mollusk localities in the lower portion of the             
              Fort Union Group, which remain relatively uncommon, 3) general                 
              taxonomic study of the uppermost Cretaceous and Paleocene mollusks             
              to provide a framework for taxon identification, and 4) detailed               
              taxonomic study of selected taxa within families that appear to be             
              particularly useful for purposes of biostratigraphy and                        
              biochronology in the northern Great Plains.//
