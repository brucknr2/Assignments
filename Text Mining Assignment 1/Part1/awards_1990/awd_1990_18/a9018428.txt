Abstract    :
              The goal for the first three years' research in my lab is to                   
              establish Arabidopsis as a useful system for the biochemical and               
              genetic analysis of ribosomal gene regulation.  Ribosomal RNA genes            
              comprise 8% of the total Arabidopsis genome.  We have isolated                 
              numerous ribosomal RNA genes from an Arabidopsis thaliana genomic              
              library, and are looking for RFLP's that map to the intergenic                 
              spacer in potential regulatory regions.  We have putatively                    
              identified the transcription start site by S1 mapping, and have                
              noticed a duplication of the start site sequence further upstream              
              in the intergenic spacer.  Future work will determine if these                 
              duplicated sequences represent spacer promoters, which have never              
              been described in plants but are present in many other organisms.              
              We will also look for sites of transcript 3' end formation to help             
              localize potential terminator sequences in the arabidopsis spacer.             
              To test the activity of potential cis-acting elements, such as                 
              promoters and enhancers, we will construct ribosomal minigenes                 
              whose transcripts can be distinguished from the endogenous                     
              ribosomal gene transcripts in transient expression assays.  Once               
              the assay is optimized, we will attempt to determine if spacer                 
              repeat sequences enhance transcription, as in Xenopus and mouse.               
              We will also examine the effects of auxin on specific initiation by            
              RNA polymerase I.  Finally, we will screen Arabidopsis genomic and             
              cDNA libraries for the plant homolog of the vertebrate RNA                     
              polymerase I transcription factor, UBF.                                        
                                                                                             
              These studies are aimed at establishing the relationship between               
              ribosomal gene organization and biochemistry in Arabidopsis with               
              other, better species as a prelude to genetic analyses that can be             
              undertaken in plants.***//
