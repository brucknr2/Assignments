Abstract    :
                   The metamorphic and structural consequences of ridge                      
              subduction along a convergent margin are not well known, but is                
              significant because virtually all convergent margins will                      
              ultimately consume a spreading center.  This collaborative project             
              between EAR90-18717 and EAR90-20391 will examine the Chugach                   
              metamorphic complex which possesses several unusual features that              
              can be attributed to ridge subduction in the Tertiary.  Work will              
              focus on the anomalous low P, high T metamorphic and the structural            
              and kinematic setting which accompanied the formation of this                  
              metamorphic assemblage.  Results will lead to a general model for              
              ridge subduction-related tectonics.
