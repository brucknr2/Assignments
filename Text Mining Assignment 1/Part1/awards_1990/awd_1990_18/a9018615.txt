Abstract    :
              The research contained in this proposal utilizes the surface                   
              proteins of Tetrahymena thermophila to determine the mechanisms                
              involved in environmental regulation of surface protein mRNA                   
              stability.  The ciliated protozoan, Tetrahymena thermophila is                 
              being used as a model system because it contains a family of                   
              surface protein genes (serotype genes) whose expression is                     
              dependent on incubation temperature.  The major mechanism                      
              controlling Tetrahymena serotype expression is a dramatic                      
              temperature-dependent change in mRNA stability.  Preliminary                   
              evidence indicates that cis-acting elements and trans-acting                   
              factors could mediate this change in mRNA half-life.  We will use              
              a recently developed Tetrahymena transformation vector and in vivo             
              and in vitro mutagenesis schemes to identify these elements and                
              factors.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              How cis and trans-acting elements interact to regulate the ultimate            
              appearance of gene products is still largely a mystery.  These                 
              experiments should illuminate one such mechanism.***//
