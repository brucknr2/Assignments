Abstract    :
              The proposed project will be a systematic biochemical                          
              characterization in vitro of the mechanism of transcription                    
              attenuation by human RNA polymerase II at a site within the                    
              adenovirus major late transcription unit.  This site has been shown            
              to promote transcriptional blockage at late but not early times                
              during adenovirus infection.  Experimental conditions have been                
              found with which efficient termination at this site can be observed            
              and studied in a soluble, cell-free protein extract.  A major goal             
              of this research is to identify the proteins that are involved in              
              termination or antitermination at this site and to characterize the            
              role of these proteins in the reaction mechanism.  This analysis               
              will be complemented and extended by a localization and dissection             
              of the DNA sequences that contribute to the elongation behavior of             
              the polymerase.  In addition, a number of functional properties of             
              the reaction will be examined to provide a better understanding of             
              the molecular mechanism of termination.  These properties include              
              the kinetics and extent of transcript release and the role of this             
              research relates to recent evidence from a number of different                 
              laboratories that transcription attenuation within genes is an                 
              important regulatory mechanism in differential gene expression in              
              eukaryotic cells.                                                              
                                                                                             
              The long-term goal of this research is to identify possible ways               
              attenuation of transcription by RNA polymerase II might be                     
              regulated in vivo so that future experiments can focus specifically            
              on defining these regulatory mechanisms.*** //
