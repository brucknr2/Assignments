Abstract    :
              The program at the University of Virginia plans to increase the number         
              of minority students earning the Ph.D. degree in engineering to at least       
              three per year.  The project will build on and extend a strong and             
              aggressive minority program started in 1986.  The focus is on fields           
              where experience has shown them to expect the largest minority applicant       
              pool, namely, chemical engineering, electrical engineering, mechanical         
              and aerospace engineering, and systems engineering.  Success in those          
              departments will encourage more minority Ph.D.s in other departments of        
              engineering and applied science.  The organization and management plan         
              is modeled on the management structure found successful in the current         
              minority graduate program.
