Abstract    :
                   The Oregon State University will study the feasibility                    
              of printing efficient, easy-to-read tactile equations for                      
              blind people.  They will use the normal equation format with                   
              fonts redefined to something resembling Braille symbols.                       
              The equations will be printed with a raised image printer                      
              and will be tested for readability by blind scientists and                     
              engineers.  The investigator will try to find more efficient                   
              characters than the standard 2x3 Braille raised dot cell.
