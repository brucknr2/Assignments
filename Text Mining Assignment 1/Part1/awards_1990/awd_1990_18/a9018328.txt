Abstract    :
              Our objective is understanding molecular mechanisms of                         
              transposition of mobiles genetic elements.  We study bacteriophage             
              Mu, as mechanisms used in Mu transposition are highly analogous to             
              those of other mobile genetic elements, prokaryotic and eukaryotic.            
              Thus unique properties of Mu as a lysogenic virus and a transposon             
              allow use of in vivo biochemical studies which are difficult or                
              impossible in systems with low frequency of transposition.  During             
              the present grant period, we will focus on understanding the role              
              of a novel transposition enhancer (CEN), located in the center of              
              the Mu genome, which contains a strong DNA gyrase binding site.                
              We will test models for use of CEN-like enhancers in other systems.            
              CEN is the clearest example presently available of a gyrase binding            
              site with a specific function.  Study of its mechanism of action               
              should help in understanding not only the role of gyrase in                    
              transposition, but also in organization of large DNA structures                
              such as the prokaryotes nucleoid.
