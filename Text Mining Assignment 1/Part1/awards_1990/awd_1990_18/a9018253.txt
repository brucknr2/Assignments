Abstract    :
                   This Special Minority Award provides a year of support for                
              Zane P. Gibbs, a graduate student at Virginia Commonwealth                     
              University.  The award will allow Mr. Gibbs to finish his                      
              course work expeditiously and reach the research participation                 
              phase sooner.  This award is an integral part of the strategy                  
              of the National Science Foundation to strengthen and increase                  
              minority participation in the field of physics.
