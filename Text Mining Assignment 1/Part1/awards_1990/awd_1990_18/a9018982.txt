Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The long-term objective of this proposal is to understand how                  
              heme protein architecture regulates heme protein reactivity.                   
              The project has as its focus the Glycera dibranchiata monomer                  
              hemoglobins.  There are three distinct monomer hemoglobins two                 
              of which exhibit structures similar to vertebrate myoglobins.                  
              Despite this their kinetic properties differ significantly from                
              myoglobin, for the probable reason that in each of the monomer                 
              hemoglobins the distal histidine is replaced by leucine.  In                   
              the case of cyanide binding, for example, these proteins are                   
              notably unreactive in comparison to vertebrate myoglobins.  One                
              of these globin cDNA sequences has been cloned, sequenced and                  
              expressed in an E. coli expression system.  Site-directed                      
              mutants have also been constructed to see if enhanced                          
              reactivity can be built in to a naturally unreactive structure.                
              Wild-type proteins and site directed mutants will be studied                   
              using kinetics, equilibrium and NMR to fulfill the goal of                     
              relating structure to function.
