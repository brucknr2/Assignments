Abstract    :
              This project is to improve the scientific understanding of                     
              Mississippi-Valley-type (MVT) ore deposits through comprehensive               
              geochemical characterization of the ore-forming fluids. The                    
              approach stresses use of 87Sr/86Sr as an isotopic tracer in                    
              minerals deposited throughout the paragenesis, specifically                    
              including sulfides which have very low Sr concentrations.  As                  
              appropriate for specific samples the Rb-Sr analyses will be                    
              complemented by isotopic analyses of Pb and S or C and O and                   
              abundance determinations of trace elements (Sr, Rb, K, Ca, Na,                 
              Mg, Pb, U, halogens) (some of these analyses to be performed by                
              collaborators).  These analyses will provide significant                       
              constraints on the provenance of the ore-forming fluids and their              
              flow paths from source to site of deposition.  Studies will focus              
              on MVT districts in the Viburnum Trend, the Upper Mississippi                  
              Valley district, the Tri-State district and the Northern Arkansas              
              Zinc district.
