Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal is designed to elucidate the mechanisms that                     
              regulate translation of the mRNAs encoding  transition proteins,               
              protamines and the mitochondrial capsule seleno-protein in                     
              haploid spermatogenic cells in mice. The central aim is to                     
              determine whether the observation that protamine 1 messenger                   
              ribonucleoprotein complexes (mRNPs) form initiation complexes                  
              with 80s single ribosomes slower than deproteinized protamine 1                
              mRNAs in brief incubations in the reticulocyte cell free lysate                
              reflects the mechanisms that repress translation of protamine 1                
              mRNA in vivo. The kinetics of formation of initiation complexes                
              in vitro will be compared for mouse protamine 1 mRNAs in                       
              deproteinized poly(A) plus mRNA, translationally repressed mRNPs,              
              translationally active mRNPs and translationally repressed mRNPs               
              after disruption of mRNP complexes with high salt. The                         
              interactions of cis-acting sequences in protamine 1 mRNAs and                  
              trans-acting mRNP proteins will be analyzed by synthesizing                    
              radiolabeled run off protamine 1 transcripts with bacteriophage                
              RNA polymerases, constituting mRNP particles by incubation with                
              cytoplasmic extracts, and translation in cell free system and gel              
              mobility shift assays. Non-isotopic in situ hybridization will be              
              used to determine whether protamine 1 mRNAs are sequestered                    
              intracellularly in round spermatids. This proposal is intended to              
              introduce promising undergraduates to research in molecular                    
              biology.
